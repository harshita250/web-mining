"What happens if a parking ticket is lost / destroyed before the owner is aware of the ticket , and it goes unpaid ? I 've always been curious . Please explain like I'm five.","If a parking ticket is lost or destroyed before the owner is aware of it and it goes unpaid, the owner may be subject to additional fines or penalties. It is important for the owner of a vehicle to check for any parking tickets regularly and to pay any tickets that have been issued in a timely manner. If a ticket is lost or destroyed, the owner should contact the issuing agency as soon as possible to explain the situation and see if it is possible to resolve the issue. It is always better to try to take care of a parking ticket as soon as possible to avoid any additional fines or consequences.","In my city you also get something by mail to the registered address on the car . Failure to pay increases the fine and eventually it goes to collections . For us , parking citations are a civil violation and there 's no possibility of criminal prosecution ."
"why the waves do n't interfere ? first , I 'm sorry for my english . try to understand what I mean . there are lots of electromagnetic waves in the air such as radio waves . here is the question , why these waves interfere each other ? Explain like I'm five. ","Interference is the phenomenon that occurs when two waves overlap or combine. When two waves interfere with each other, they can either reinforce each other, making the combined wave stronger, or they can cancel each other out, resulting in a weaker or zero wave.\n\nThe strength of the interference depends on the phase of the waves, which is the position of the waves in their cycles. If the waves are in phase, meaning they are at the same position in their cycles, they will reinforce each other. If the waves are out of phase, meaning they are at opposite positions in their cycles, they will cancel each other out.\n\nRadio waves can interfere with each other when they are transmitted from different sources, such as two different radio stations or two different devices using the same frequency. This can cause a phenomenon called ""static"" or ""noise"" in the radio signal. However, radio waves can also be used to interfere with each other on purpose, such as in radar systems or in radio telescopes, to create a beam of radio waves that can be directed and focused on a specific target.","They do actually . That 's why a microwave oven might slow down your wifi or you migut have to press three times on your garage door keyfob if you are also using your cordless phone . A short intro : radio uses frequencies , a concept meant to split data sources apart : radio stations , gsm operators . A frequency has a bandwidth ( how much it can carry ) , an absorbtion factor and you can tradeoff speed ( up to the max bandwidth for reliability ) . A submarine signal ( ultra low freq ) can be on / off and can be heard anywhere in the world , but it can only say yes or no . A 5GHz link can be heard around your house , but carries more than 10MBps . There are many more factors at play this this , mostly that rf waves bounce , reflect , and you never know how they reach you ( fi : an earlier reflection can cancel the current signal ) . But some applications , like GSM get their dedicated frequencies . This is good , because the frequencies most likely to cancel you out are those near to you ( this is relative ) . There are also "" encoding "" techniques , called modulation . Usually you vary a fixed frequency by the amount of your signal : if you want to transmit a 440Hz signal on a 96MHz carrier signal , you vary the 96MHz signal in sync with the 440 one : from 96 000 000 - 220 to 96 000 000 + 220 . This is called frequency modulation . This is old tech , by modern standards . Even TV broascast switched to digital , that s why you might have received a set top box , ans an old TV can no longer receive anything with just an antenna . The only globally widespread application of FM still in use is FM radio ( music , news ) mostly because digital replacements sucked and never caught on , while making an am receiver in case of emergencies is dead simple ( coil a wire with a diode / led scrapped out of anything on a tin can ) . Currently , various modulation techniques are used for digital data : bits represent specififc "" notes "" , the carrier is varied 100 times per second . For example , see [ MFSK ] ( URL_1 ) or generic [ spread spectrum ] ( URL_0 ) techniques . tl;dr : they do interfere , but modern transmit / receive techniques cancel most problems out ."
Is it possible to influence a company's actions by buying stock?,"Yes, it is possible to influence a company's actions by buying stock. As a shareholder, you have the right to vote at shareholder meetings and can use this right to influence the decisions made by the company. For example, you can vote for or against proposals put forward by the company's management, such as changes to the company's business strategy or the appointment of new board members. You can also engage with the company's management and other shareholders to advocate for specific actions or changes that you believe would benefit the company and its shareholders. However, it's important to keep in mind that the influence of individual shareholders can be limited, especially if they hold a small number of shares compared to other shareholders.","Yes and no. This really should be taught at junior school level in a capitalist country but that is a different argument. A company is influenced by its shareholders but not in the way you are hoping. This is the only area where a Company must behave democratically with one share one vote. If you own one share in a company (specifically a voting share), then you are entitled to attend an AGM where you will have a vote on issues presented by the board. You might have an opportunity to make a statement or ask a question at the AGM, but I wouldn't rely on it. You will not be able to influence the companies behavior beyond that unless you control enough shares to influence the board. Notice I said 'control' not 'own'. If you get other shareholders to agree to vote with you, then you effectively control their shares. Shareholders are there to get a return on their investment, so you must convince them that they will get a better return by agreeing with you then by following the board (that they put there!). Convince them that (for example) a trespass lawsuit will rob the company of more value then the profit to be made and they might agree to not trespass. Morals, ethics, justice etc., are human attributes and since most shareholders are other corporations not humans, they have no place in your arguments with one exception; Goodwill is a value that appears on a balance sheet and you might be able to use emotional arguments to show that there is a risk of a loss of goodwill from the proposed actions. You can make your argument stronger by generating media pressure on customers and suppliers of the company to make critical public comments."
Why do taxpayers front the bill for sports stadiums ? Should n't that be a business 's ( NFL ) responsibility ? Please explain like I'm five.,"Sports stadiums are usually built with public money, meaning that the cost is paid for by taxpayers. This is often done because the stadiums are considered to be a public good, meaning that they provide benefits to the community as a whole, not just to the team or business that uses the stadium.For example, a new sports stadium can create jobs and bring in tourists and other visitors to the area, which can have a positive impact on the local economy. The government might decide that the benefits of building a new stadium outweigh the cost to taxpayers, and so they agree to pay for it.However, it's important to note that not everyone agrees that taxpayers should have to front the bill for sports stadiums. Some people think that the team or business that will use the stadium should be responsible for paying for it, since they will be the ones benefiting from it.","That 's the bargaining chip that team owners use to keep them from moving to another city : build / improve our stadium or we walk . While the math is pretty fuzzy on what kind of economic benefit a sports team can provide , few mayors want to be the person who lost the local sports team ."
Why do clothing stores generally have a ton of XL and XXL sizes in stock but only a few S and M sized items left ? Would n't supply and demand have corrected this problem by now ? amirite people ? Please explain like I'm five.,"There are a few reasons why clothing stores may have more XL and XXL sizes in stock compared to smaller sizes. One reason is that larger sizes may be more popular in certain areas or among certain demographics. For example, if a store is located in a region where people tend to be larger in size, they may sell more larger sizes. Similarly, if a store caters to a particular demographic that tends to be larger in size, they may also sell more larger sizes. Another reason is that it can be more expensive to produce smaller sizes. Clothing manufacturers often have to use more fabric and pay more attention to detail when making smaller sizes, which can increase the cost of production. As a result, stores may order fewer smaller sizes to save on costs. Finally, it's important to note that clothing stores often order their inventory based on past sales data. If a store has consistently sold more larger sizes in the past, they may order more of those sizes in the future. On the other hand, if they have consistently sold fewer smaller sizes, they may order fewer of those sizes. Overall, the balance of sizes in a store's inventory is influenced by a combination of factors, including consumer demand, production costs, and past sales data.","Your observation is almost certainly a matter of perceptual bias . If you 're only looking for small size clothing , it 's frustrating when you ca n't find it and everything is X / XL instead . However , when you 're looking for clothing and you do find the right size you generally do n't remember how much X / XL was always there . As a result , virtually everyone will have the same experience of "" there 's never anything in my size ! "" even though everyone is not the same size ."
Landlord Tax Relief Changes UK,"In the United Kingdom, landlords are responsible for paying taxes on any income they receive from renting out their properties. In the past, landlords were able to claim tax relief on certain expenses related to their rental properties, such as mortgage interest payments, insurance, and repairs and maintenance. However, changes to the tax system in recent years have significantly reduced the amount of tax relief that landlords can claim.In 2017, the UK government introduced a change to the way that landlords could claim tax relief on mortgage interest payments. Previously, landlords were able to claim tax relief on the full amount of their mortgage interest payments at their marginal tax rate. However, the 2017 change introduced a tapered reduction in the amount of tax relief that landlords could claim, starting at a 20% reduction for those earning between £50,000 and £100,000 and increasing to a full phasing out of tax relief for those earning over £200,000.In addition to the changes to mortgage interest tax relief, the UK government also introduced a new tax, known as the ""section 24"" tax, which further reduced the amount of tax relief that landlords could claim. Under this tax, landlords are no longer able to claim tax relief on a number of expenses, including repairs and maintenance, insurance, and certain other costs.Overall, these changes have significantly reduced the amount of tax relief that landlords can claim on their rental properties, which has made it more difficult for landlords to profit from their investments. Landlords who are affected by these changes may need to consider adjusting their rental prices or finding other ways to reduce their costs in order to maintain their profitability.","This article on the landlord website Property118.com shows a simple example, demonstrating that a private landlord with a mortgage could see a huge jump in their effective tax rate (in this case, from 18% to 67% by 2020), while a corporate landlord will see no change at all. There's also a link in that article to a detailed report which is highly critical of the tax changes. The government obviously take a different view! (See here for more worked examples of how the tax changes will be applied). More information can be found on this on various landlord sites. A key phrase to look for is ""section 24"", referring to the section of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2015 which implements the change. Note that this change only applies to private landlords (i.e. those who own a property personally, rather than through a company), and who have a mortgage on the property, and who (after the new calculations) are higher or additional rate taxpayers."
Profiting from the PWC Money Tree,"I'm sorry, but I'm not familiar with the term ""PWC Money Tree."" Could you provide more context or explain what you're asking about?","The hardest part seems to be knowing exactly when to sell the stock.  Well yes, that's the problem with all stock investing. Reports come out all the time, sometimes even from very smart people with no motivation to lie, about expected earnings for this company, or for that industry. Whether those predictions come true is something you will only find out with time. What you are considering is using financial information available to you (and equally available to the public) to make investment choices. This is called 'fundamental analysis'; that is, the analysis of the fundamentals of a business and what it should be worth. It forms the basis of how many investment firms decide where to put their money.  In a perfectly 'efficient' market, all information available to the public is immediately factored into the market price for that company's stock. ie: if a bank report states with absolute certainty (through leaked documents) that Coca-Cola is going to announce 10% revenue growth tomorrow, then everyone will immediately buy Coca-Cola stock today, and then tomorrow there would be no impact. Even if PwC is 100% accurate in its predictions, if the rest of the market agrees with them, then the price at the time of IPO would equal the future value of the cashflows, meaning there would be no gain unless results surpassed expectations. So what you are proposing is to take one sliver of the information available to the public (have you also read all publicly available reports on those businesses and their industries?), and using that to make a high risk investment. Are you going to do better than the investment firms that have teams of researchers and years of experience in the investment world? You can do quite well by picking individual stocks, but you can also lose a lot of money if you do it haphazardly. Be aware that there is risk in doing any type of investing. There is higher than average risk if you invest in equities ('the stock market'). There is higher risk still, if you pick individual stocks. There is yet even higher risk, if you pick small startup companies.  There are some specific interesting side-elements with your proposal to purchase stock about to have an IPO - those are better dealt with in a separate question if you want more information; search this site for 'IPO' and you should find a good starting point. In short, the company about to go public will hire a firm of analysts who will try to calculate the best price the public will accept for an offering of shares. Stock often goes up after IPO, but not always. Sometimes the company doesn't even fill its full IPO order, adding a new type of risk to a potential investor, that the stock will drop on day 1. Consider an analogy outside the investing world:  Let's say Auto Trader magazine prints an article that says ""all 2015 Honda Civics are worth $15,000 if they have less than 50,000 Miles."" Assume you have no particular knowledge about cars. If you read this article, and you see an ad in the paper the next day for a Honda Civic with 40k miles, should you buy it for $14k? The answer is not without more research. And even if you determine enough about cars to find one for $14k that you can reasonably sell for $15k, there's a whole world of mechanics out there who buy and sell cars for a living, and they have an edge both because they can repair the cars themselves to sell for more, and also because they have experience to spot low-offers faster than you. And if you pick a clunker (or a stock that doesn't perform even when everyone expected it would), then you could lose some serious money. As with buying and selling individual stocks, there is money to be made from car trading, but that money gets made by people who really know what they're doing. People who go in without full information are the ones who lose money in the long run."
"What is a clearing bank, in specific, what does RMB clearing bank do?","A clearing bank is a financial institution that acts as a clearinghouse for the exchange of financial instruments between banks and other financial institutions. In this role, the clearing bank acts as an intermediary between the banks and other financial institutions that are involved in a financial transaction, facilitating the exchange of funds or securities and helping to ensure that the transaction is completed smoothly and efficiently.RMB clearing banks, specifically, are banks that have been designated by the Chinese government to clear and settle transactions denominated in the Chinese currency, the renminbi (RMB). These banks play a critical role in the financial system of China, helping to facilitate the exchange of RMB between banks and other financial institutions both within China and internationally. RMB clearing banks are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the financial system by ensuring that all transactions are properly settled and reconciled, and they also play a key role in supporting the growth and development of China's domestic and international financial markets.","Clearing means processing unsettled transactions. Specifically - all the money transfers between the banks, in this case. Clearing Bank for RMB business means that all RMB transactions will be cleared through that specific bank. If bank A in Hong Kong gets a check drawn on Bank B in Hong Kong, and the check is in RMB - A will go to the BoC with the check and will get the money, and BoC will take the money from B. That obviously requires both A and B have accounts with BoC. ""Sole"" clearing house means there's only one. I.e.: in our example, A and B cannot settle the check through C where they both happen to have accounts, or directly with each other. They MUST utilize the services of BoC."

"Is there an upper limit to how tall a building can be ? Assume a 50,000 square feet cuboid building on a plain , firm land , in a landlocked area and not on any major earthquake prone areas . How tall can it be theoretically ? Explain like I'm five. ","There is no theoretical upper limit to how tall a building can be, but there are practical limits that depend on several factors. Some of these factors include the strength of the materials used to construct the building, the stability of the ground the building is built on, and the wind and weather conditions in the area.\n\nFor example, if a building is made of very strong materials like steel or concrete, it can be built taller than a building made of weaker materials like wood. Similarly, if the ground the building is built on is very stable and not prone to earthquakes or other types of ground movement, the building can be built taller. On the other hand, if the ground is unstable or the area is prone to earthquakes, the building may need to be shorter and have a stronger foundation to prevent it from collapsing.\n\nWind and weather can also affect the height of a building. In an area with strong winds, a taller building may need to be built with extra support to keep it from swaying too much. Similarly, in an area with a lot of snowfall, a taller building may need to have a steeper roof to prevent snow from building up and causing the roof to collapse.\n\nOverall, there are many factors that can limit the height of a building, but with the right materials, foundation, and design, it is possible to build very tall buildings.","The limit is based on the weight the construction can carry . If the construction can not carry that amount anymore , then it will crush under its own weight . For example , the World Trade Centre towers , you might have heard a little bit about it . They were 400 meters high . The metal and concrete construction were properly specced to hold its heights for the first 35 years : Nothing wrong with it . Now due to an external incident , the metal construction is affected and lost its strength . It then collapsed under the weight of the construction on top of it and it folded nicely on top of itself . The space elevator principle is based on a string of 36 thousand kilometers . Currently there is no material which can carry that weight without breaking ."
Second Egyptian Uprising What are the people protesting ? How did this happen ? Explain like I'm five.,"The Second Egyptian Uprising, also known as the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, was a series of protests and demonstrations that took place in Egypt in 2011. The people were protesting against the government of Hosni Mubarak, who had been in power for over 30 years. They were calling for political reforms, including free and fair elections, and for an end to corruption and repression. The protests began on January 25, 2011, when a group of young people gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square to protest against the government. They were inspired by similar protests that had taken place in other countries, such as Tunisia and Libya, and they used social media to organize and spread the word about their demonstrations. The protests quickly gained support from other people in Egypt, and soon there were protests and demonstrations taking place all across the country. The government responded with violence, arresting and attacking protesters, but the protesters continued to speak out and demand change. After several weeks of protests, President Mubarak stepped down and handed over power to the military. The people of Egypt celebrated, but the situation in the country has remained uncertain since then, with ongoing political struggles and unrest.",The armed forces took power after the fall of Mubarak and now they do n't want to let go . The Egyptian people are pissed that Mubarak 's cronies are still in power and want it to stop .
why our eyes react the way they do to optical illusions Examples such as things that your eyes see as moving even though they are n't . Or any sort of illusion like that . Explain like I'm five.,"Optical illusions happen when our brains are tricked by the way something looks. For example, if you look at a picture of a spiral that is moving, your brain might think that it is actually moving even though it is just a static image. This is because our brains use clues from the environment to help us understand what we are seeing. When these clues are misleading or confusing, it can cause our brains to interpret the image in a way that doesn't match what is really happening. Another example of an optical illusion is when you look at a picture of a square that has been divided into smaller squares, and some of them are different shades of gray. Your brain might think that the squares are moving or changing color even though they are not. This is because our brains are trying to make sense of the image by grouping the different shades of gray together and treating them as one solid color. Overall, optical illusions are a fun way to see how our brains work and how they can be tricked by what we see.","It 's actually our brains that react to optical illusions . The light that enters our eyes is converted into neuronal impulses ( an electric and chemical message ) and sent to the back of our brains , an area called the Occipital Cortex . That area of the brain organizes the information our eyes report to make sense . There are bits of our brain that look for certain lines and angles , contrast , and shapes . Those areas then report to other areas of increasing complexity . We have evolved to sense depth and motion based on certain cues , like shading -- this results in a whole bunch of optical illusions , where our brain misinterprets the information that the eyes report ."
Why do hotels put a Bible in every room ? I just wonder about why hotels find this to be a fundamental part of what 's involved in a hotel room . It 's extremely consistent . Please explain like I'm five.,"It is common for hotels to have a Bible in the room because many people consider the Bible to be a source of guidance and comfort. Hotels want to provide their guests with a pleasant and welcoming experience, so they try to include things that might be helpful or meaningful to their guests. Some people may find it helpful to have a Bible in their room in case they want to read a passage or do some personal reflection. Others might not be interested in the Bible at all and just leave it alone. It's up to each individual person to decide how they want to use it.",They do n't .

"Would two consenting minors having sex be considered rape ? NSFW , just in case . I did a little bit of background Googling , but i got conflicting answers . ( Sorry for any spelling errors , I 'm currently on mobile ) Please explain like I'm five.","No, two consenting minors having sex would not be considered rape. In order for an act to be considered rape, it must involve non-consensual sexual activity. This means that one or more of the individuals involved did not give their freely given and enthusiastic consent to the sexual activity. 
Consent is an important part of any sexual activity, and it is important for all individuals involved to make sure that everyone is comfortable and willing before engaging in any sexual activity. If anyone is not fully on board or if there is any doubt about whether or not all parties have given their full and enthusiastic consent, it is important to stop and talk about it before continuing. 
So, to summarize, rape is when someone is forced to have sex or participate in sexual activity against their will. If both people involved in a sexual encounter are willing and enthusiastic participants, it is not rape.","Usually no , if they 're of similar ages . What you 're looking for are called "" Romeo and Juliet laws "" , which are exceptions to statutory rape laws ."
Why is it that calling / texting another country costs more but when visiting a website that s hosted in another country does n't effect price . Surely they use similar cable runs ( not share ) so where s the cost incurred ? Explain like I'm five.,"When you make a phone call or send a text message to another country, your phone has to send a signal through special cables that connect different countries together. These cables are owned by different companies, and they charge money to use them.

On the other hand, when you visit a website that is hosted in another country, you are not actually sending a physical signal through these cables. Instead, you are using the internet to connect to the website. The internet is a network of computers that are all connected to each other, and it allows you to send and receive information without having to use special cables.

So, when you visit a website hosted in another country, you are using the internet to connect to the website, which doesn't cost extra money. But when you make a phone call or send a text message to another country, you are using special cables that cost money to use. That's why it costs more to call or text another country than it does to visit a website hosted in another country.","I 'm going to go ahead and guess it does n't cost anywhere near as much as it used to do call internationally , but phone companies keep the prices jacked up for profit ."
"If a person is born deaf , how do they think ? As a person born deaf has never heard their own voice , how do they think ? how do they know what emotions are ?

How do film / tv productions handle deaths of actors ? Examples ? I know that multiple actors replaced Heath Ledger in The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus but I 've never seen it . Explain like I'm five.,"When an actor dies during the production of a film or TV show, it can be a difficult and emotionally challenging situation for everyone involved. The production team may have to make the decision to either continue filming without the actor, or to halt production until a plan can be developed to address the actor's absence.

One example of how a film production dealt with the death of an actor is The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus, in which Heath Ledger died before completing all of his scenes. In this case, the filmmakers decided to continue with the production and use a combination of special effects and other actors to finish Ledger's remaining scenes. Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell all played versions of the character that Ledger had portrayed, and their appearances were altered through the use of makeup and special effects to make it appear as though they were the same character.

Another example is when Philip Seymour Hoffman died during the production of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay. In this case, the filmmakers decided to rewrite the script and use existing footage of Hoffman to complete his scenes. They also used a digital double, a computer-generated version of the actor, for some shots in which Hoffman's character appears in the background or from a distance.

Overall, the decision of how to handle the death of an actor during production will depend on the specific circumstances and the needs of the production. The goal is usually to honor the actor's memory and contribution to the film or TV show while also completing the production in a way that is respectful and sensitive to everyone involved.","Usually it leaves them scrambling . I know when John Ritter died they actually had to write that death into "" 8 Simple Rules "" ."
why do the touch screens of some mobile phones only work with the finger . They do nt work with a pen or anything else . Why so ? URL or Text Here Explain like I'm five.,"Touch screens on mobile phones use a technology called capacitive touch, which means they can detect the electrical conductivity of your skin. When you touch the screen with your finger, your body conducts electricity, which the phone can detect and use to determine where on the screen you touched. Pens and other objects do not conduct electricity in the same way as your skin, so the phone is not able to detect their touch. Some touch screens are designed to work with special styluses that have a tip made of a material that can conduct electricity, but these are not as common as screens that only work with your finger.","Most touch screens with a hard surface , like on phones etc , use an effect known as ' capacitive coupling ' ( hence the name capacitive touch screen ) to sense a press . The surface of the panel forms a capacitor with your body and the circuitry senses this . It requires a slightly conductive pointer , hence why a hotdog will work but an insulating pen wo nt . A resistive touchscreen ( they are * slightly * squishy to press ) relies on physical pressure , so any pointer will work with them . Then there 's infra red touchscreens too , which line up a row of sensors and IR transmitters ( like a row of tiny versions of your TV remote ) along the edges of the screen and sense your finger blocking the light from travelling from one side to another . They can use anything that is n't transparent to work ."
"Why does ice work so well to remove blood stains ? I would get nose bleeds for no reason as a kid . This was my mom 's tried and true method for getting out the occasional blood stain , but I 've never known how it works . Explain like I'm five.","Ice works well to remove blood stains because it helps to solidify the blood, making it easier to remove. When blood is in liquid form, it can be more difficult to clean up because it can spread and get absorbed into fabrics. But when you apply ice to a blood stain, the cold temperature causes the blood to become solid, or ""freeze,"" making it easier to scrape off or wipe away. Once the frozen blood is removed, you can then treat the stain with a stain remover or laundry detergent to help remove any remaining residue. Does that make sense?",TIL ice is used to take out blood stains .
Best Practices for Managing Paper Receipts,"Here are some best practices for managing paper receipts:Keep receipts organized: Create a system for organizing receipts, such as using envelopes or a folder to keep them in a specific place. This will make it easier to find receipts when you need them.Scan or photograph receipts: Use a smartphone or scanner to create digital copies of receipts. This will allow you to access them easily and minimize clutter.Label receipts: Clearly label receipts with the date and purpose of the purchase. This will make it easier to identify the purpose of the receipt when you need to reference it.Keep important receipts: Keep receipts for large purchases or those that have a warranty or return policy. These receipts will be useful if you need to make a return or claim a warranty.Discard unnecessary receipts: Regularly go through your receipts and discard those that are no longer needed. This will help to minimize clutter and make it easier to find important receipts.Use receipt tracking software: There are several receipt tracking software options available that can help you manage receipts digitally. These tools allow you to upload receipts and categorize them, making it easier to track expenses and stay organized.","I store all my receipts digitally, and make sure to input them into accounting program sooner than later, just so I don't forget about it. For practical purposes, the two important things are: Any kind of a digital system makes this pretty easy, even just putting the sums in a spreadsheet and the receipts into files with the date in the name. However, because it's easy enough, I also have a box where I stuff the paper receipts. I expect never to need them, but should something very weird happen to my computer and backups, they would be there."
where do crocodiles live,"Crocodiles are found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, including Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Australia.

"Why does n't the bible / gospels count as historical evidence but written accounts like the romans do ? Thanks guys , learned a lot Explain like I'm five.","The Bible and the Gospels are considered to be religious texts and are not considered to be historical evidence in the same way that accounts written by ancient Roman historians are. This is because the Bible and the Gospels are primarily focused on teachings about faith and spirituality, rather than on presenting a historical record of events. Ancient Roman historians, on the other hand, wrote about events that they witnessed or that they learned about from others who witnessed them, and their accounts are considered to be more reliable as a source of historical information.","Well , "" the Bible "" consists of many books , which run the gamut from "" mythology passed down as an oral tradition "" ( Genesis ) , to "" thinly - veiled political commentary "" ( Revelation ) , to "" loosely based on historical events "" ( the Gospels ) . So you have to take individual books of the Bible ( preferably very old copies in the original language ) , and compare them against other writings that we have from the same time period , as well as to our vast wealth of knowledge of things like anthropology , geography , biology , etc . In short , the books of the Bible are historical evidence just like any other historical book , and we treat them the same way : Cross - reference , sanity - check with modern knowledge , and take unsubstantiated claims with a grain of salt ."
"Please explain what is ""Tony Hoare""","Tony Hoare is a British computer scientist and a pioneer in the field of computer science. He is best known for his work on the development of the programming language ALGOL and for his contributions to the design of the operating system CTSS. Hoare has also made significant contributions to the fields of computer programming, computer science theory, and the development of software engineering as a discipline. He was awarded the ACM Turing Award, often considered the ""Nobel Prize"" of computer science, in 1980 for his contributions to the development of the programming language CSP and for his fundamental contributions to the definition and design of programming languages. Hoare is a Fellow of the Royal Society and a member of the Order of the British Empire.","Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare (Tony Hoare or C. A. R. Hoare) FRS FREng (born 11 January 1934) is a British computer scientist who has made foundational contributions to programming languages, algorithms, operating systems, formal verification, and concurrent computing. His work earned him the Turing Award, usually regarded as the highest distinction in computer science, in 1980.
Hoare developed the sorting algorithm quicksort in 1959–1960. He developed Hoare logic, an axiomatic basis for verifying program correctness. In the semantics of concurrency, he introduced the formal language communicating sequential processes (CSP) to specify the interactions of concurrent processes, and along with Edsger Dijkstra, formulated the dining philosophers problem.[10][11][12] He is also credited with development (and later criticism) of the null pointer, having introduced it in the ALGOL family of languages. Since 1977, he has held positions at the University of Oxford and Microsoft Research in Cambridge."
What happens to my plastic bottle after I throw it in the recycling bin ? How long does it take before it is another plastic object for consumer use ? Explain like I'm five. ,"When you throw your plastic bottle in the recycling bin, it is collected by a truck and taken to a recycling facility. At the recycling facility, the plastic bottles are sorted by type and cleaned. Then, they are chopped into small pieces called ""plastic flakes.""\n\nThe plastic flakes are melted and formed into small pellets. These pellets are then used to make new plastic products, such as bottles, bags, and other household items.\n\nThe whole process from collecting the plastic bottles to making new plastic products can take a few weeks to a few months, depending on the type of plastic and the equipment being used. It's important to recycle plastic bottles because it helps to reduce the amount of waste in the environment and saves resources, such as oil, that are used to make new plastic.","TL;DR : Your plastic bottle will almost always wind up in a bale of sorted "" mixed plastic "" in a few days , maybe a week or so . But it 's hard to say how long it will be until that bale is processed into recycled plastic granules / pellets and then used to make consumer goods . Let 's start with you putting your plastic bottle in a recycling bin . What happens next ? First , the bin gets collected by a waste management company . This may or may not be the same company that collects non - recyclable garbage in any given area , but it 's almost always done with trucks dedicated to recycling . The recycling trucks dump their loads at a recovery facility that may or may not be owned by the same company that owns the trucks . These drop offs occur pretty much all day during business hours , but any given recycling bin is typically only collected once a week . Second , the recovery facility sorts incoming "" mixed material "" into different categories using a number of different processes , some automated , some manual . Paper is sorted with an "" air knife "" that blows it onto a different belt while leaving heavier materials behind . Metals are separated with a magnet ( yes , even aluminum , though not in the same way that steel cans are ) . Rotating drums sort out lighter materials ( like plastic ) from heavier ones ( like glass ) . And "" pickers "" remove things like plastic bags , contaminated cardboard , wet / shredded paper , etc . , that tend to jam up the machines . Your plastic bottle will most likely end up in a gigantic container containing almost all plastic , sometimes even sorted by plastic type ( depends on the facility ) . The recovery facility will then compact these plastics ( mixed or otherwise ) into bales , usually of a size appropriate for moving around with a skid loader . This sorting / baling process can potentially run 24/7 , depending on how many different waste management companies are dropping off "" mixed material "" at a particular recovery facility . So , how long does all of the above take ? Well , it could be anywhere from a few minutes to an entire week after you put your bottle in the bin before it gets picked up . But once that happens , it 'll probably make its way into a sorted "" mixed plastics "" bale in less than 24 hours , as recovery facilities try to process material more - or - less as fast as it comes in . Otherwise they 'd wind up with an ever - expanding amount of un - sorted material to store ! Recovery facilities sell these bales to plastic recycling companies . Plastic recycling companies take in these bales , sort them ( far more carefully than the recovery facility does , and sometimes dividing different kinds of plastic into different production lines ) , wash them ( recovery facility does n't do that ) , shred them , and then melt them down to be molded into granules / pellets suitable for use in manufacturing processes . How long does it take for mixed plastic bales to get recycled ? Hard to say . Recovered "" mixed plastic "" bales are an industrial commodity . Recovery facilities obviously like to move their inventory as fast as possible , but it could be anywhere from a few days to a few weeks before any particular bale gets sold , for any number of reasons not important here . Once a recycler buys a bale , it will typically process it almost right away . But then there 's another indefinite period between producing the recycled plastic granules / pellets and selling those on to a manufacturer . Once a manufacturer buys recycled plastic , it 's typically used to make consumer products almost right away . But those two delay periods -- between compacting a bale and selling it , and between producing recycled plastic granules / pellets and selling those -- make it hard to provide a precise estimate . Again , anywhere from a few days to a few weeks . A few * months * even , if the market in recycled plastic is slow for whatever reason . Shipping takes time too , so add in a day or two for each step ."
"Should I lease, buy new, or buy used?","There are pros and cons to each option, and the best choice for you will depend on your individual circumstances and financial goals. Here are some things to consider when deciding whether to lease, buy new, or buy used:Leasing:Pros:Lower monthly payments compared to financing a new or used carNo need to worry about selling the car when you no longer want it, as you can simply return it to the dealership at the end of the leaseAbility to drive a newer car more often, as you can upgrade to a new car every few yearsCons:You don't own the car, so you don't have the same level of control over itYou may have to pay extra fees for exceeding the mileage limit or for any wear and tear on the carYou won't build equity in the car, as you would if you were to buy itBuying new:Pros:You get a brand new car with the latest features and technologyNew cars often come with a warranty, which can provide peace of mind and protect against unexpected repair costsCons:New cars tend to be more expensive than used carsNew cars depreciate in value quickly, so you may lose money on the car if you decide to sell it soon after buying itBuying used:Pros:Used cars are generally less expensive than new carsUsed cars may have already depreciated in value, so you may not experience as much depreciation if you decide to sell the car laterCons:Used cars may have more wear and tear and may require more repairsUsed cars may not have the same features and technology as new carsUsed cars may not come with a warranty, so you may have to pay for repairs out of pocketUltimately, the decision to lease, buy new, or buy used will depend on your budget, how long you plan to keep the car, and what is most important to you in a car. It may be helpful to consider your financial goals and do some research to compare the costs and benefits of each option before making a decision.","Rule of thumb is always BUY, NEVER lease, unless you plan to use it for a business where you can expense the lease payments. Leasing is the biggest scam.  Lease is just a fancy word for renting and the dealerships PRAY that people like us lease. As for new or old, new cars have better warranty but you may get a great deal on a 1-3 year old used car."
"How do SSD 's work as opposed to HDD 's ? I know that HDD 's are mechanical and SSD 's are all digital , but how exactly does a SSD work ? Explain like I'm five.","Sure! An SSD, or Solid State Drive, is a type of storage device that uses memory chips to store data. It's called a ""solid state"" drive because it has no moving parts, unlike a hard disk drive (HDD) which uses spinning disks to store data.

Here's how it works: When you save a file on an SSD, the data is stored on tiny chips called ""memory cells."" These cells are arranged in a grid, kind of like a big checkerboard. To read or write data, the SSD uses tiny electrical charges to turn the cells on or off. A cell that is ""on"" represents a 1, and a cell that is ""off"" represents a 0. By combining lots of these 1s and 0s, the SSD can store all kinds of information, like documents, pictures, and music.

One of the advantages of an SSD is that it can access and transfer data very quickly because there are no moving parts to slow it down. This makes it faster than an HDD, which has to physically locate the right part of the spinning disk to access the data.

I hope that helps explain how an SSD works! Let me know if you have any other questions.","As you probably know , a typical HDD uses * magnets * and * motors * to capture and store data . This has been a really great method for many years , but - as with all moving parts - they eventually start to break down . SSDs address this issue by using * electrical current * instead of hinges and gears , etc . But * how * do they do it ? * * TRANSISTORS ! * * A "" transistor "" is basically a semiconductor that can accept / reject electrical signals . If the transistor accepts an electrical current , it is represented as 1 . If the transistor * is not * accepting an electrical current , it is represented as 0 . This is great , because it perfectly aligns with the computer language of binary , which represents * everything * as a gigantic series of 1s and 0s . It 's a ' hand in glove ' moment of serendipity . A blank SSD will start with ( mostly ) 1s --- remember this means they can all accept current . When you add a piece of data , it is converted to binary , then converted into electrical currents , and this essentially realigns the transistors . Some of the 1s will then be switched to 0s , and it 's simply a matter of creating the "" right pattern "" in the transistors , so they accurately reflect the binary code that is being sent . It 's really just a form of translation , like English to German ( sort of ) , except driven by electricity . If you want to be technical , yes , this is still essentially a form of "" moving "" , but it is * so small * ( i.e. : microscopic scale ) that it does n't present quite the same clunky problems . Of course , even transistors will eventually wear out if you ' switch ' them enough , so you may need to replace the SSD at some point in time . But it is a rather large number ( I ca n't recall exactly , but I believe it is in the thousands ) , and the average user is unlikely to exceed this in practical circumstances . With all that said : * do n't * rely on an SSD ( or an HDD , or anything else ) as your sole source of content control . Even the greatest technology can break down and malfunction . Get a backup device , or use some cloud storage ( e.g. : DropBox / SkyDrive ) ."
"Why do n't people use anaesthetics when getting a tattoo ? It seems like one of the big cons of getting a tattoo is the pain , so why do n't they just give you a local anaesthetic so you ca n't feel it ? Please explain like I'm five.","Tattoos are typically done using a machine that punctures the skin repeatedly with a needle to inject ink into the dermis, which is the layer of skin just below the epidermis. While the process of getting a tattoo can be painful, many people choose to undergo the process without using anaesthetics because they do not want to numb the area being tattooed. 
There are several reasons why people might choose not to use anaesthetics when getting a tattoo. One reason is that some people enjoy the experience of getting a tattoo and see it as a form of body modification or self-expression. They may feel a sense of pride or accomplishment in enduring the pain of the tattoo process. 
Another reason is that local anaesthetics, which are medications that numb a specific area of the body, can be expensive and may not be covered by insurance. Some people may also be allergic to anaesthetics or may not want to risk the potential side effects of the medication. 
In addition, some tattoo artists may not offer anaesthetics as an option because they believe that the pain of getting a tattoo is part of the process and may even enhance the tattoo's overall appearance. 
Overall, the decision to use anaesthetics when getting a tattoo is a personal one that depends on an individual's pain tolerance and preferences. If you are considering getting a tattoo and are concerned about the pain, you may want to discuss your options with your tattoo artist and a healthcare provider.",True anesthetics require a medical professional and most tattoo parlors do n't want to staff for one . The cost of the nurse to do it is in addition to all the licensing and such the parlor would need to keep medical drugs on - site .
Why do exporting nations want to weaken their currency ? I was reading [ this ] ( URL_0 ) article and was wondering why Japan wants to weaken their currency to promote trade . Explain like I'm five.,"Exporting nations, like Japan, want to weaken their currency to make their goods cheaper for foreign buyers. When a country's currency is weak, it means that it takes fewer units of the foreign currency to buy the domestic currency. For example, if the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Japanese yen is 1:100, it means that it takes 100 yen to buy 1 US dollar. If the exchange rate changes to 1:80, it means that it now takes fewer yen to buy 1 US dollar, and the yen has become weaker compared to the US dollar.

When a country's currency becomes weaker, it makes the country's goods cheaper for foreign buyers because they don't have to exchange as much of their own currency to buy the goods. For example, if a Japanese company sells a product for 10,000 yen, and the exchange rate is 1:100, it would cost a foreign buyer $100 to buy the product. If the exchange rate changes to 1:80, the same product would now cost the foreign buyer only $125 to buy. So, a weaker currency can help a country's exports by making them more competitive and attractive to foreign buyers.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",A weaker currency means your products are cheaper in other countries ... meaning they 're more competitive . More competitive products are easier to sell more of .
"How does the bail system work in the USA ? if you ' post bail ' of $ 15,000 , say , do you get it back or what ? Do you get it back if the person was innocent or is it gone either way ? Please explain like I'm five.","In the United States, the bail system works by allowing someone who has been arrested and charged with a crime to pay a certain amount of money, called bail, in order to be released from jail while they wait for their court case to be resolved. If the person pays the bail, they can go free until their court date. If they don't show up to court, they will lose the money they paid for bail. If the person is found not guilty, they will get the bail money back. If the person is found guilty, the bail money will be used to pay for any fines or fees associated with the case. So if the bail was $15,000 and the person is found guilty, they will not get the $15,000 back.","After you are arrested , the state wants a guarantee that you will show up for court . The "" bail "" money is used to coerce you into compliance . You get the money back when the case is disposed of , guilty or not , as long as you appear in court when you 're told . If you do n't show up , you have "" jumped bail "" and the cops and maybe Dog the bounty hunter will come looking for you ."
"How is open source software more secure ? Since I can see the whole code , if , say , I find a vulnerability , ca nt I just exploit it ? Explain like I'm five.","\nOpen source software is often more secure because many people can see and review the code. When lots of people are looking at the code, it's more likely that any vulnerabilities or weaknesses will be found and fixed.\n\nThink of it like this: if you have a group of friends looking for a lost toy in your house, they might be able to find it faster than if you looked for it by yourself. That's because more people can search more areas in a shorter amount of time. It's the same with open source software. When lots of people are looking at the code, they can spot any problems more quickly and fix them.\n\nOn the other hand, if the code for a program is not open source, then only a small group of people can see and work on it. This means that any vulnerabilities or weaknesses might not be found as quickly, which could make the program less secure.\n\nSo, even if you can see the whole code of an open source program, it's still less likely that you'll be able to find and exploit a vulnerability because someone else might have already found and fixed it.","You could certainly exploit that vulnerability , but because everybody can also see the code , there 's a good chance someone else has also noticed that vulnerability before you , and steps to correct it might already be in progress . Additionally , with open source code , it is often far easier to get in touch with the developers and report issues directly to them than it is with closed - source projects . As a result , security issues can sometimes be resolved faster . With most open - source code , the public is often allowed and encouraged to submit code improvements directly to the developers . So someone could submit the code to fix a vulnerability as a part of them reporting an issue"

How does a game like Skyrim have enough content for people to play hundreds of hours ? I keep seeing posts of people saying 300 hours in and still discovering new things . How can there be that much content ? Thanks ! Please explain like I'm five.,"Skyrim is a very large and detailed game with a lot of different things to do. There are many different quests to complete, locations to explore, and enemies to fight. The game also has a vast world with many different characters and cultures, which adds to the depth and richness of the game. 
One of the main ways that Skyrim is able to keep players engaged for hundreds of hours is through its open-world design, which allows players to explore and do things in whatever order they choose. This means that players can take their time and follow their own interests as they play, rather than feeling like they have to rush through the game to see everything it has to offer. 
In addition to the main quests, Skyrim also has a lot of side quests, minigames, and other activities that players can do. For example, players can collect ingredients and create potions, cook food, smith weapons and armor, and much more. There are also many secrets and hidden areas to discover, which can keep players engaged for a long time. 
Overall, Skyrim has a huge amount of content because it has a rich and detailed world, a variety of different things to do, and a lot of secrets and hidden areas to discover. This is what makes it such a popular and enduring game that people can play for hundreds of hours and still find new things to do.",Well part of it is just there is really that much hard coded content in the game . It takes them years and years to make these games and bethesda the developers had actually been working on skyrim since oblivion which came out in 06 . I mean they took some time with it on the back burner to make fallout 3 but afterwards they went full steam ahead on skyrim . So they had at least 4 - 5 years to work on it which is a long time and an above average dev time for a video game today . That much dev time with one of the best developers in the industry = A lot of content . Second is that skyrim has a lot of random / procedurally created content can take up a lot of time . So you can literally spend hours doing something that is n't a main or side quest and does nothing to advance forward the plot of the game .
when did the cold war start,"The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies that lasted from the late 1940s to the early 1990s. It is generally accepted that the Cold War began at the end of World War II, around 1945, and ended in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. The term ""Cold War"" refers to the fact that the two sides never directly engaged in a full-scale armed conflict, but rather used proxy wars, economic competition, and political and military intimidation to exert influence on each other. The tensions between the two sides were fueled by ideological differences, with the United States and its allies promoting democracy and capitalism, and the Soviet Union and its allies promoting communism.","The Cold War, often dated from 1947 to 1991, was a sustained state of political and military tension between powers in the Western Bloc , dominated by the United States with NATO among its allies, and powers in the Eastern Bloc , dominated by the Soviet Union along with the Warsaw Pact ."

"Why do most people talk to pets with a higher pitched voice ? Most people that I 've met talk to their pets , or animals in general , with a higher pitched voice . Why is that ? Explain like I'm five. ","People often use a higher pitched voice when talking to pets or animals because it can be more engaging and pleasing to them. Animals are more sensitive to higher frequency sounds, and a higher pitched voice can grab their attention more easily. Using a higher pitched voice can also make you sound more friendly and playful, which can help build a stronger bond with your pet. Additionally, some research suggests that animals may be more likely to respond to a higher pitched voice because it is similar to the sound of their own species when they are communicating with each other. Overall, using a higher pitched voice when talking to pets can be a fun and effective way to communicate with them and build a strong relationship.","Habit and social convention mainly But pets ( especially dogs ) tend to respond more positively to higher pitched sounds than lower pitches .

Light years . I 'm always confused on what exactly light years are . I 've heard they 're to measure distance but that 's all I 've heard . Explain like I'm five.,"Light years are a unit of distance used to measure very large distances in space. One light year is the distance that light can travel in one year.

Light travels at a very high speed, about 300,000 kilometers per second. This means that in one year, light can travel a distance of about 9.5 trillion kilometers (or about 5.9 trillion miles). So if something is one light year away, it is very far away. It would take a long time to travel that distance, even in a spaceship that goes very fast.

For example, if you were to travel to a star that is one light year away, it would take you about one year to get there if you were traveling at the speed of light (which is not possible for anything with mass). But it would take much longer to get there if you were traveling in a spaceship, because even the fastest spaceships are much slower than the speed of light.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.","A light year is the distance a ray of light will cover in a year . A year being a , well , * year . * You know .

"Why Humans in general are so scared of Arachnids Why are Arachnids so terrifying to such a wide audience of people ? There are many other similarly sized/ potentially similarly shaped creatures , why are n't they as feared as arachnids ? Explain like I'm five.","It's not uncommon for people to be afraid of arachnids, especially spiders, because they are often associated with danger or venom. Spiders, in particular, have eight legs and move quickly, which can be unsettling to some people. Additionally, some spiders can bite and inject venom, which can be painful or even harmful to humans. It's also possible that the fear of arachnids is a learned or cultural fear, meaning that people may have been taught to be afraid of them or may have grown up in a culture where spiders are feared. Other insects or creatures may not be as frightening to some people because they do not have the same associations with danger or venom.","Fear is an evolutionary tool given to us in order to avoid potential threats that may harm us or cause death . the fear of Arachnids , vermins , snakes and heights for that matter are instincts rooted in ( most ) of us to help us survive and pass our genes . those who lacked these instincts usually had slimmer chances to pass their genes before an untimely death caused by a fascinating poisonous spider . and so the slightly more fearful and cautious has survived and passed their genes to us ."
what people used mayan numeral system,"The Maya civilization, which flourished in Mesoamerica (present-day Mexico and Central America) from approximately 2000 BCE to 1500 CE, used a vigesimal (base-20) numeral system to represent numbers. The Maya numeral system was used for counting, calculating, and keeping track of time.\n\nThe Maya numeral system was based on a combination of bar and dot symbols. The basic unit of the Maya numeral system was the dot, which represented the number 1. A bar symbol represented the number 5. The Maya numeral system used a place value system similar to the decimal system used in the modern Western world. For example, the number 18 in the Maya numeral system was represented by three dots and a bar, while the number 300 was represented by a symbol that looked like a shell.\n\nThe Maya numeral system was used by the Maya civilization for a wide range of purposes, including calculating the dates of celestial events, recording historical events, and keeping track of time. The Maya numeral system was also used in trade and commerce, as well as in the measurement of land and other resources. Despite the fact that the Maya civilization collapsed over 500 years ago, the Maya numeral system continues to be studied by historians and researchers today for its insights into the culture and history of the Maya civilization.",Maya numerals are a vigesimal ( base - twenty ) numeral system used by the Pre-Columbian Maya civilization .
"Please explain what is ""Customer lifetime value""","Customer lifetime value (CLV) is a measure of the total value that a customer will generate for a business over the course of their relationship with the company. It is an important concept in marketing and customer relationship management, as it helps businesses to understand the long-term value of their customers and to allocate resources accordingly.



To calculate CLV, a business will typically consider factors such as the amount of money that a customer spends over time, the length of time they remain a customer, and the profitability of the products or services they purchase. The CLV of a customer can be used to help a business make decisions about how to allocate marketing resources, how to price products and services, and how to retain and improve relationships with valuable customers.



Some businesses may also consider other factors when calculating CLV, such as the potential for a customer to refer other customers to the business, or the potential for a customer to engage with the business in non-monetary ways (e.g. through social media or other forms of word-of-mouth marketing).","In marketing, customer lifetime value (CLV or often CLTV), lifetime customer value (LCV), or life-time value (LTV) is a prognostication of the net profit 
contributed to the whole future relationship with a customer. The prediction model can have varying levels of sophistication and accuracy, ranging from a crude heuristic to the use of complex predictive analytics techniques.
Customer lifetime value can also be defined as the monetary value of a customer relationship, based on the present value of the projected future cash flows from the customer relationship. Customer lifetime value is an important concept in that it encourages firms to shift their focus from quarterly profits to the long-term health of their customer relationships. Customer lifetime value is an important metric because it represents an upper limit on spending to acquire new customers. For this reason it is an important element in calculating payback of advertising spent in marketing mix modeling.
One of the first accounts of the term customer lifetime value is in the 1988 book Database Marketing, which includes detailed worked examples. Early adopters of customer lifetime value models in the 1990s include Edge Consulting and BrandScience."
How do soccer players curve the parabolic trajectory of the soccer sphere ?

This makes the ball spin around its center as it moves through the air. Because the ball is spinning, the air flows differently over one side of the ball compared to the other. This difference in airflow causes the ball to curve, or bend, in the direction of the spin. Just like a spinning top, the ball will lean towards the direction it is spinning in. Another way to curve the ball is to kick it with the outside of the foot (the part furthest away from the other foot). This also causes the ball to spin, but in the opposite direction. Kicking the ball with the outside of the foot will cause it to curve in the opposite direction of the spin. It takes a lot of practice and skill to be able to kick the ball with the right amount of spin and force to make it curve the way you want it to. Some players are better at this than others, and it's one of the things that makes soccer such a fun and exciting sport to watch.","A ball only follows a parabolic trajectory in the absence of air resistance . A spinning ball deflects airflow around the ball , which creates a force on the ball . This is called the [ Magnus effect ] ( URL_0 ) ."
How come a mechanical watch changes it ’s time over a long period of time Found an old watch from a few years ago and it ’s around 20 minutes behind what my current time is . Explain like I'm five. ,"A mechanical watch is a type of timepiece that uses a mechanical movement to keep time. This means that it has a series of gears and springs inside of it that work together to power the watch and keep it running.\n\nOver time, these gears and springs can become worn out or lose some of their tension. When this happens, the watch may not run as accurately as it did when it was new. This can cause the watch to lose time or gain time, depending on the specific issue with the movement.\n\nIn addition, external factors such as temperature, humidity, and even the position of the watch can also affect the accuracy of a mechanical watch. For example, if a watch is stored in a very cold place, the oils used to lubricate the movement may become thicker and cause the watch to run slower.\n\nOverall, the reason a mechanical watch can change its time over a long period of time is due to the mechanical movement inside of it and the various factors that can affect its accuracy.","For starters , if it 's been running nonstop since "" a few years ago "" , I doubt it 's actually a mechanical watch . A mechanical watch , one driven by a wound up spring and gears , can only run for a few days without needing to be wound . It 's far more likely that you have some sort of quartz watch - where a battery run electricity through a crystal and count the vibrations - that simply has an analog face ( ie - moving hands instead of an LCD display ) . Quartz watches can run for years on a single battery without a problem - smart ones can even stop moving the hands to save power & just slide them back to where they belong once motion is detected . That out of the way ... Watches and clocks all do one simple thing internally : they make something happen periodically and count how many times it happens . A grandfather clock tracks swings of a pendulum , a mechanical watch tracks the oscillations of a spring loaded weight & quartz movements run electricity through a quartz crystal , causing it to vibrate and they count those vibrations . If the speed of that periodic thing is n't precisely tuned , the timepiece might run slightly fast or slow . Being off by only 20 minutes in a year means that it 's 99.996 % accurate - if it 's been multiple years , that 's even more accurate . One source I found online says that typical mechanical watches are typically only accurate to within 10 seconds per day & quartz watches are generally within about 15s per month . If you want to spend more money , you can get more accuracy - as little as 5s per year - but even a $ 100 - 150 watch can do 15s / year ( as long as you prioritize accuracy over flashiness ) . All of that pales in comparison to sensitive scientific instruments . Atomic clocks can * easily * be accurate to within a second every million years . The current record is [ accurate to 1 second every 15 billion years ] ( URL_0 ) ."
"Why does CGI in movies look so real but does not as much in AAA title video games ? The graphics in The Last of Us look really good , but compared to the Hobbit or Avatar , look not that great at all . Why is that ? Explain like I'm five.","CGI in movies and video games are created using similar techniques, but there are a few key differences that can affect their realism. One reason that CGI in movies might look more realistic is that it is often created at a higher resolution than CGI in video games. This means that the images in movies have more detail and are clearer, which can make them look more lifelike. Another reason is that movies often have a larger budget for CGI than video games, which means that the artists working on the CGI have more time and resources to perfect the final product. Finally, the way that CGI is used in movies and video games can also be different. In movies, CGI is often used to create entire worlds or characters that are not possible to create in the real world, while in video games, CGI is often used to enhance or augment real-world environments or characters.",Because everything in your video game is done on the fly . Though PC 's are getting closer and closer to getting it like in the movies it 's not there yet . And in movies everything is pre - rendered .

What are the tax implications on selling the Share ISA portfolio?,"If you sell your share ISA portfolio, any profits you make from the sale will generally not be subject to capital gains tax because ISAs are tax-free accounts. However, it's important to note that ISAs have annual subscription limits, and if you exceed the limit for the tax year, you may be subject to a tax charge. It's also worth noting that if you sell shares that you have held for less than a year, any profits you make may be subject to income tax, rather than capital gains tax. It's a good idea to consult with a tax professional or financial advisor if you have any specific questions about the tax implications of selling your ISA portfolio.","Assets held within an ISA or New ISA are completely free of CGT, so you won't have to pay either income tax or capital gains tax."
"What 's the difference between a Senior Vice President and a Vice President of a company ? Are their duties completely different ? Why the difference in the titles ? I notice , like at General Motors , there 's a lot of both . Please explain like I'm five.","A Senior Vice President (SVP) is a high-level executive in a company who is responsible for a specific area or division of the organization. They often have a lot of experience and expertise in their field and may oversee a team of other executives and employees.A Vice President (VP) is also a high-level executive in a company, but they may not have as much responsibility or authority as an SVP. In some cases, a VP may be responsible for a specific area or division of the company, similar to an SVP, but they may not have as much decision-making power.The difference in the titles often reflects the difference in responsibilities and authority. In some cases, the title of SVP may be given to an executive who has a more broad or general role within the company, while a VP may have a more specialized or focused role.It's common for companies to have both SVPs and VPs as part of their leadership team. This can help ensure that there are a variety of perspectives and expertise at the highest levels of the organization.","Strongly depends on the company . In some companies , it 's an executive position . In others-- especially client - facing ones such as banks , consultancies , and marketing agencies , VP can be a popular title for most mid - career positions . This started out as a way to make clients feel that they were interfacing with someone important , but it 's since then drifted into non - client - facing roles at those companies due to title inflation .

Prime Numbers and Cryptography ELI5 : Can someone explain how prime numbers are significant in cryptography ? I know that a prime number is a number divisible only by itself and one and that the largest prime is very significant in cryptography . Please explain like I'm five.,"Sure! Prime numbers are very important in cryptography because they are very hard to predict. This makes them useful for creating secret codes that can't be easily broken by someone trying to steal the information. Here's an example of how prime numbers are used in cryptography: Imagine you have a secret message that you want to send to your friend, but you don't want anyone else to be able to read it. You could use prime numbers to create a special code for your message. First, you would pick two very large prime numbers and multiply them together to get a third number. This third number would be the ""key"" to your code. You would then use the key to ""encrypt"" your message by changing the letters in the message into numbers using a special formula, and then perform some mathematical operations on the numbers using the key. Your friend would have a copy of the key and would be able to use it to ""decrypt"" the message by reversing the process. This way, anyone who tries to intercept the message and read it without the key wouldn't be able to understand it, because they wouldn't know how to decrypt it. Does that make sense?","One of the thing about numbers ( any numbers , not just prime numbers ) for the purpose of cryptography is that while it 's very easy to multiply two numbers together to get a third number , it 's an awful lot harder to start with the third number and work out what the original two were . As a very simple example not involving prime numbers , if I asked you to multiply 10 x 10 you could give me the answer in an instant . However if I gave you the number "" 100 "" and said "" which two numbers did I multiply to get 100 "" you could n't necessarily tell me the correct answer straight away . It might have been 10 x 10 , but it could have been 20 x 5 , or 25 x 4 , or even 100 x 1 . An important property of prime numbers is that when you multiply them together to get another number , the * only * numbers that you can divide the third number by is the original prime numbers . So 3 is prime , 7 is prime , and 3 x 7 = 21 -- the only numbers which you can divide 21 by are in fact 3 and 7 . This always works with any two prime numbers you choose . So , to finally answer your question ! Imagine your computer has two prime numbers . Both of these are very , very large numbers -- dozens of digits long if you were to write them out in decimal . Now multiply them together , this is something that computers are very good at . This gives you a third , extremely long number . Now , anyone who knows the initial two prime numbers can get the third number , but if you have the third number there is no known way to determine what the original prime numbers were , other than trying every possible number . This is the basis of cryptographic techniques using prime numbers -- because there is an algorithm ( i.e. a mathematical procedure ) which is easy to do in one direction but very time - consuming to do in reverse , that algorithm can be used to produce secret codes and encrypt data ."
"Please explain what is ""Soft computing""","Soft computing is a field of study that focuses on the design and development of computational systems and algorithms that are inspired by, or mimic, human cognition, perception, and behavior. These systems and algorithms are often referred to as ""soft"" because they are designed to be flexible, adaptable, and tolerant of uncertainty, imprecision, and partial truth.



Soft computing approaches differ from traditional ""hard"" computing approaches in that they are designed to handle complex, ill-defined, or poorly understood problems, as well as to process data that is noisy, incomplete, or uncertain. Soft computing techniques include a wide range of methods, including artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, evolutionary algorithms, probabilistic reasoning, and machine learning, among others.



Soft computing techniques are widely used in a variety of applications, including pattern recognition, data mining, image processing, natural language processing, and control systems, among others. They are particularly useful for tasks that involve dealing with incomplete or ambiguous information, or that require the ability to adapt and learn from experience.","Soft computing is a set of algorithms,

Why do uneducated people tend to have more children ? I would like to know specifically regarding first world nations . I know many people in developing nations do n't have access to contraception . Explain like I'm five. ,"There are many reasons why some people who have less education might have more children. Some of these reasons may be different in different countries, but here are a few potential reasons:\n\nLack of access to information: People who have less education may be less likely to have access to accurate information about contraception and how to use it effectively. This can make it more difficult for them to prevent unintended pregnancies.\n\nBeliefs and values: Some people who have less education may hold different beliefs and values about family size and parenting than people who have more education. They may believe that having a larger family is important for their happiness or that having more children will bring them greater fulfillment.\n\nEconomic considerations: People who have less education may also have lower incomes, which can make it more difficult for them to afford the cost of contraception or to pay for other family planning services. In some cases, having a larger family may be seen as a way to provide additional income or support for the household.\n\nLimited access to healthcare: People who have less education may also have less access to healthcare services, including family planning services. This can make it harder for them to obtain contraception and other forms of birth control.\n\nOverall, there are many complex factors that can influence why some people have more children than others. Some of these factors may be related to education, while others may be related to other aspects of a person's life and circumstances.","TL / DR ; Less education means more children . More religion means more children . Less access to health care means more children . Earlier age of marriage means more children . Poor people have less education , more religion , less access to health care , and an earlier age of marriage . Also , minorities and immigrants from less developed countries tend to * want * larger families because of their culture . These groups also tend to be poor . ----- * * EDUCATION : Less education = more children * * Poor people tend to be less educated - they perform poorly in school , are more likely to be expelled or drop out , and struggle to afford higher education . There are many theories about why education relates to family size : 1 ) Women with less education are less likely to be able to support themselves independently . Because they rely upon a husband , they tend to think of their contributions to family as more important to contributing to economy . Ergo , more children . 2 ) Women with more education will have a career , not just a job . They prefer to work rather than parent , and will focus on vocational success . Children and families make financial success more difficult . By focusing on a career , the woman neglects settling down to have children until later in her life . 3 ) People who are more educated tend to have better impulse control . They are more likely to plan out when they want to have a family based upon their finances . They are less likely to have unprotected sex , or to use drugs and substances that might result in accidental pregnancies ( hooking up while drunk , for instance ) . They are also more aware of the various birth - control options available and will seek them out . 4 ) Poorly educated people might not know about all the contraception options that exist , how to use them properly , or where they might obtain birth - control pills or spermicides etc . Most individuals learn about contraception in school - so where do drop outs learn about it ? They might not have access to Google ... * * RELIGIOSITY : More religion means larger families * * Poor individuals are more likely to be religious that wealthy individuals . Also , less educated individuals are more likely to be dogmatically religious that people with a 4 - year degree . This can have several outcomes : 1 ) Contraceptives are purposefully ignored . Catholics , for instance , view the use of birth control or condoms as a sin . Many denominations view abortions or "" the morning after pill "" as murder . 2 ) Some religious denominations actively encourage women to be caring mothers with lots of children . You see this more with fringe groups , like the ( small ) snake - handling group within Pentecostalism or the ( small ) polygamist group within Mormonism . 3 ) Religion encourages an early age of marriage . The younger a woman is when married , the more children she will have over her lifetime . Also , married couples are more likely to have unprotected sex than couples that are cohabiting or having pre - marital sex . * * INCOME : Less money means more children * * This is pretty obvious when you think about it . Contraception costs money . Condoms , birth control , spermicide , morning - after pill , and abortions are all expensive - particularly if you add up the cost - per - month and look at years at a time . Most birth - control pills require prescriptions , which means doctor visits , which are super expensive if you do n't have insurance . Even though condoms can be bought for a dollar a piece , that 's expensive if you are living on welfare ( and I do n't think food - stamps cover contraception ) . ~~Hysterectomies~~ Tubal ligation and vasectomies are also a rather common contraceptive used by middle and upper class individuals . Usually after they have had a child or two and think their family is big enough - so no surprise children later in life . Also , people with more money tend to thing in economic terms . Children are expensive , and people with money budget for this ; they will wait to have children until they can afford them , and will prefer small families because it is easier to pay for karate for 2 boys than for 5 . This thought process is n't seen in poor families . * * RACE : Minorities and Immigrants are over - represented among the poor . Immigrants from developing countries are more likely to * want * larger families . * * Developing countries do n't have large families * only * because of lack of birth control , they have large families because it is * culturally acceptable and preferable * to have large families . If you take a couple from Sub - Saharan Africa , teach them all about condoms and birth control , and put them in America and give them access to contraception they are still more likely to have a large family because * they will want to have many children * . Culturally speaking , more children means the parents are better people . This idea carries over into the children of immigrants , as well as the grandchildren . The family size declines with each generation , and by the 4th generation the birth rate looks more like the rates of the host culture . ----- EDIT 1 : Clarity and phrasing . EDIT 2 : Removing implied causality statements ."
"How did ancient humans migrate and spread all over the world ? I 'm not talking about homo sapiens but the previous ancestors , how did they cross seas and survive in areas they 're not used to ? Please explain like I'm five.","Ancient humans, like all animals, migrated and spread to new areas in search of food, water, and resources, or to escape predators or other threats. Some ancient humans migrated by walking long distances on land, following animal herds or other sources of food. Others may have followed rivers or coastlines, using boats or rafts to cross bodies of water.It is thought that some ancient humans, such as Homo erectus, were able to migrate over longer distances and adapt to new environments by using tools and developing new ways of obtaining food and resources. For example, they may have learned how to hunt or gather food in new ways, or they may have learned how to use fire to cook food or keep warm.It is also possible that ancient humans migrated by ""island-hopping"" across shorter distances, using boats or rafts to travel between islands. This would have allowed them to colonize new areas without having to cross large bodies of water.Overall, ancient humans were able to migrate and adapt to new environments through a combination of intelligence, resourcefulness, and the ability to learn and adapt to new situations.",They walked . They built rafts . They were chased away . They are pretty adaptable to new climates and situations .
"What does increasing "" contrast "" on a TV or computer screen actually do ? I mean , it has to do something with black and white , but what exactly ? How does it work ? Thanks ! :) < 3 Explain like I'm five.","Contrast on a TV or computer screen refers to the difference in brightness between the darkest and lightest parts of an image. When you increase the contrast, the dark parts of the image become darker and the light parts become lighter. This can make the image look more vibrant and ""pop,"" but it can also make it harder to see details in the shadows (dark areas) or highlights (light areas).

To understand how contrast works, imagine that you are looking at a black and white photo. If the photo has low contrast, all of the tones in the photo will be similar shades of gray. If you increase the contrast, the dark areas will become very black and the light areas will become very white.

In a color image, contrast works in a similar way. Increasing the contrast will make the colors in the image more vibrant and distinct from each other, but it can also make some colors ""clip,"" or become so bright or dark that they lose detail and appear as pure black or pure white.

Overall, adjusting the contrast on your TV or computer screen can help you fine-tune the appearance of an image to your personal preference, but it's important to be aware of the trade-offs that come with increasing or decreasing the contrast.","Everyone 's pretty much covered it , it adjusts the difference between lights and darks , but [ here is a nice picture illustrating it ] ( URL_0 ) .

Why is poop watery when you have diarrhea ? I 'm on the toilet now and have no idea why this shit is like a faucet . Lack of fiber ? Idk ELI5 please . Explain like I'm five.,"Diarrhea is a condition where your poop becomes watery and loose. There are many things that can cause diarrhea, including:

Infections: Diarrhea can be caused by infections from viruses, bacteria, or parasites. These infections can cause inflammation in the intestine, which can lead to diarrhea.

Food poisoning: If you eat food that is contaminated with bacteria or other harmful substances, it can cause diarrhea.

Inflammatory bowel disease: Certain conditions, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, can cause inflammation in the intestine, leading to diarrhea.

Medications: Some medications, such as antibiotics, can cause diarrhea as a side effect.

Lack of fiber: A diet that is low in fiber can cause constipation, but it can also sometimes cause diarrhea.

In general, diarrhea is your body's way of getting rid of something that is causing problems in your intestine. It is important to drink plenty of fluids when you have diarrhea to prevent dehydration. If your diarrhea persists for more than a few days, it is important to see a doctor to determine the cause and get proper treatment.","one of the most important jobs of your large intestine is to absorb water . if your large intestine is disrupted somehow ( by sickness or injury ) you wo n't be able to absorb enough water , so you 'll just poop it out as diarrhea ."

It's natural to want to try and make the pain go away as quickly as possible. One way to do this is by sucking on your thumb, which can help to soothe the pain and make it feel better. Another reason why people might suck their thumb after getting hurt is because it can help to calm them down. When you're in pain, your body releases stress hormones that can make you feel upset or anxious. Sucking your thumb can help to relax you and make you feel better emotionally, in addition to helping with the physical pain.

"Please explain what is ""Developmental robotics""","Developmental robotics is a field of robotics that focuses on the design and development of robots that are capable of learning and adapting to their environment over time, much like a human child or animal might. It involves the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to enable robots to learn from experience and adapt to new situations, as well as to interact with and understand the world around them in a more natural and human-like way.



Developmental robotics research often involves the use of developmental psychology and cognitive science theories to inform the design of robot learning algorithms and behaviors. The ultimate goal of this research is to create robots that are able to learn, adapt, and behave in a way that is similar to how humans and other animals develop and learn over the course of their lives. Such robots could potentially be used in a variety of applications, including education, entertainment, and even healthcare.","Developmental robotics (DevRob), sometimes called epigenetic robotics, is a scientific field which aims at studying the developmental mechanisms, architectures and constraints that allow lifelong and open-ended learning of new skills and new knowledge in embodied machines. As in human children, learning is expected to be cumulative and of progressively increasing complexity, and to result from self-exploration of the world in combination with social interaction. The typical methodological approach consists in starting from theories of human and animal development elaborated in fields such as developmental psychology, neuroscience, developmental and evolutionary biology, and linguistics, then to formalize and implement them in robots, sometimes exploring extensions or variants of them. The experimentation of those models in robots allows researchers to confront them with reality, and as a consequence, developmental robotics also provides feedback and novel hypotheses on theories of human and animal development.
Developmental robotics is related to but differs from evolutionary robotics (ER).  ER uses populations of robots that evolve over time, whereas DevRob is interested in how the organization of a single robot's control system develops through experience, over time.
DevRob is also related to work done in the domains of robotics and artificial life."
"What are the negative effects of LSD ? I'v already taken it , but I still do n't know what I did to my body and brain . Could you guys help me understand ? Explain like I'm five.","LSD, also known as lysergic acid diethylamide, is a powerful psychoactive substance that can produce a wide range of effects, including altered thinking, perception, and mood. It can also produce a range of physical effects, including dilated pupils, increased body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure, as well as tremors and loss of appetite.

One of the main negative effects of LSD is that it can produce ""bad trips,"" which are intense and often unpleasant experiences that can include feelings of fear, panic, and paranoia. These bad trips can be very distressing and can lead to long-term psychological problems in some people.

Another negative effect of LSD is that it can interfere with a person's ability to make good decisions or think clearly. This can lead to accidents or risky behaviors while under the influence of the drug.

It's important to note that the effects of LSD can vary widely from person to person, and the potential for negative effects increases when the drug is taken in high doses or combined with other substances.

It's also important to remember that LSD is illegal in many countries and is classified as a controlled substance. This means that it is illegal to produce, sell, or use the drug. Using LSD can also have legal consequences, even if it is for personal use.","There are no negative physical effects -- there are rumors that LSD remains in your spinal fluid forever , but this is false . Your pupils become dilated , so if you are day tripping , you should wear sun glasses . The only risk is having a bad trip , but this can be avoided by doing the drug in a comfortable place with people that you trust . LSD can trigger a psychotic episode in those with , or who will develop , schizophrenia . For the most part it is a very safe drug as long as you are being responsible and have done your research ."

Do dogs have a concept of death Edit : I 'm loving these answers . To clarify some questions . I meant if they know they will die some day Please explain like I'm five.,"It is not clear whether dogs have a concept of death in the same way that humans do. Humans have a complex understanding of death, including an awareness of their own mortality and the finality of death. Dogs, on the other hand, do not have the same level of cognitive ability and may not fully understand the concept of death. 
However, dogs are highly social animals and are able to form strong bonds with their owners and other animals. When a dog loses a companion, whether it is another dog, a human, or another animal, they may display signs of grief and loss, such as lethargy, loss of appetite, and changes in behavior. This suggests that dogs are able to recognize that their companion is no longer present and may be able to understand that death is a permanent separation. 
It is also possible that dogs have a basic instinctual understanding of death, as they may be more attuned to changes in the environment and the behavior of other animals, and may be able to sense when an animal is sick or injured. However, it is difficult to say for certain whether dogs have a fully developed concept of death, as this is a complex and abstract concept that may be beyond their cognitive abilities.","My dog and best friend of ten of ten years started having seizures last fall .

Why did Hitler invade Russia ? What made him think he could defeat Russia AND Europe ? Surely you 'd do one at a time ? Explain like I'm five.,"Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany, invaded the Soviet Union (which is another name for Russia) in June 1941 because he believed that the Soviet Union was a weak country that he could easily conquer. Hitler also believed that by defeating the Soviet Union, he would be able to control the vast resources of the Soviet Union, including its oil, which he needed to fuel his military.

However, Hitler made a grave mistake in thinking that he could easily defeat the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was a very large and powerful country with a strong military, and it was able to resist the Nazi invasion. In addition, Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union ended up stretching his military thin, as he was already fighting a war in Europe against other countries such as Great Britain and France. This made it even more difficult for him to win the war.

Overall, Hitler's decision to invade the Soviet Union was a major factor in his eventual defeat in World War II.","Soviet Union . Russia was a state of the Soviet Union . It technically took the Germans a while to reach Russia after they invaded . Anyway , Hitler had been talking about invading the Soviet Union for Lebensraum ( Living Space ) since the early 1920s when he was early in his political career . He believed that Germans needed more room , on farms , and that the lands to the East would provide these lands , after enough of their native populations had been worked and starved to death . He did n't invade on some whim in 1941 , it was n't because Germany needed oil for their war machine , it was because EVERYTHING he had done since becoming Reichskanzler in 1933 was in preparation of invading the Soviet Union . He even wrote a book that said so in the 1920s called "" Mein Kampf "" ."
"How does Greek Fire burn underwater when normal fire does n't ? It just seems magical that this type of fire has distinctively different properties than that of normal fire , what 's the reason behind that ? Please explain like I'm five.","Greek fire was a type of incendiary weapon used by the Byzantine Empire. It was used to great effect in naval battles, as it could continue burning even when it came into contact with water. The exact composition of Greek fire is unknown, as the Byzantines kept the recipe a closely guarded secret. However, it is believed to have been made from a mixture of substances that included naphtha, sulfur, and quicklime. One possibility is that Greek fire was made with a flammable liquid that could continue burning even when it was submerged in water. Naphtha is a type of hydrocarbon that is highly flammable and can burn even when wet, so it is possible that this was one of the ingredients used in Greek fire. Another possibility is that Greek fire was made with a chemical that caused it to stick to surfaces, making it difficult to extinguish. The Byzantines may have used substances like resin or tar to help the fire stick to the hulls of enemy ships, making it more difficult to put out. Overall, the reason that Greek fire was able to burn underwater is because it was made from special ingredients that allowed it to continue burning despite being surrounded by water.","Greek fire was probably a mixture of crude oil and some other substances . It was basically like early napalm . However there are substances that can ' burn ' * because * of water . Quicklime , which was available at the time , quickly achieves temperatures above 150^o C ( 302^o F ) when it gets wet ."
"How is it that commercial airline crashes are so rare ? You would think that with the many thousands of flights that move all around the world everyday , mechanical issues or pilot issues would happen more often than they do . Please explain like I'm five.","Commercial airline crashes are actually quite rare, despite the fact that there are many thousands of flights all around the world every day. There are several reasons for this: 
1. Airplanes are built to be very safe. They are designed to withstand a lot of wear and tear, and they have multiple systems in place to ensure that they stay in the air and don't have any problems. 
2. Pilots are highly trained. Pilots go through a lot of training before they are allowed to fly a commercial airplane. They learn how to handle all sorts of different situations, and they are prepared to deal with emergencies if they arise. 
3. There are strict safety regulations in place. Governments and other organizations have strict rules in place to make sure that airplanes are as safe as possible. These rules cover everything from how the planes are built to how they are maintained and operated. 
4. Airplanes are maintained regularly. Airplanes go through regular inspections and maintenance to make sure that they are in good working order. If there are any problems, they are fixed before the plane is allowed to fly again. 
Overall, these measures help to make commercial airline travel one of the safest forms of transportation.","Think about all of the things that cause car accidents . * Other drivers / cars * Mechanical issues * Driver mistakes ( including alcohol / drugs ) Let 's see how airlines tackle these : * There are n't many other planes in the sky , and whenever they 're close to each other ( near an airport ) there 's a team of people tightly organizing where they go and when . * Each plane is fully serviced by mechanics after every single flight , and parts are repaired , fluids are replaced , etc . I take fairly good care of my car , and I 'm not visiting my mechanic more than once every 2 - 3 months . Many people are much less careful than me . Imagine if all of us were getting our cars serviced a few times daily ! On top of that , keep in mind that there are only a few commercial jet manufacturers in the world , and these people sell their products for millions . There 's a lot more quality going into it than your average Honda or Ford , even though most commercial cars are made very well . * It does n't take much to get a driver 's license , but it takes a lot to become a qualified airline pilot .

"why people put up with Democrats and Republicans redrawing voter district lines to skew elections ? This is something that both parties do , though it feels very wrong . Similar to rigging elections . What do you think ? Explain like I'm five.","Gerrymandering is the practice of redrawing voter district lines in a way that gives one political party an unfair advantage in elections. It is a controversial practice because it can be used to manipulate the outcome of elections and undermine the principle of fair representation.

Both Democrats and Republicans have been accused of gerrymandering in different parts of the country. Some people put up with it because they may feel that their party is more likely to win if the district lines are drawn in their favor. Others may not be aware that gerrymandering is happening, or they may not think that it is a big enough problem to worry about.

Gerrymandering is generally considered to be unfair and can contribute to political polarization and mistrust in the democratic process.

Why are gas prices so high even though the US is producing the most it has in over two decades ? Source : URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.,"There are a few reasons why gasoline prices might be high even though the US is producing a lot of it. One reason is that the price of oil, which is used to make gasoline, is affected by a lot of different things like the cost of producing it and the demand for it from different countries. Sometimes, the price of oil goes up because there is less of it available, or because it costs more to get it out of the ground. Another reason is that it costs money to transport gasoline from where it is made to where it is sold, and these transportation costs can affect the price. Finally, the government can also put taxes on gasoline to help pay for things like road repairs and public transportation. These taxes can make gasoline more expensive.","That 's a loaded question , but on an ELI5 level : Higher domestic production is just one small piece of the supply and demand curves that dictate gas pricing . Other factors , particularly supply of imported crude ( which accounts for a very large percentage - 40 - 70 % depeneding on who you want to cite - of petroleum product in the US ) , rapidly increasing global demand and a complicated regulatory system all contribute to pump ( ha ! ) the price higher .

How to safely earn interest on business profits (UK) ,"There are several ways to safely earn interest on business profits in the UK:Keep the money in a business savings account: Many banks and credit unions offer business savings accounts that pay a higher interest rate than a regular checking account. These accounts often have higher minimum balance requirements, but the trade-off is a higher rate of return on your money.Invest in a certificate of deposit (CD): A CD is a type of time deposit offered by banks and credit unions. It allows you to earn a fixed interest rate on your money for a set period of time, typically ranging from a few months to a few years. CDs are generally considered low-risk investments, but they may not offer as high of a return as other investment options.Invest in government bonds: Government bonds are debt securities issued by national governments. They are generally considered low-risk investments, as the government has a strong ability to make timely interest and principal payments. However, they also tend to offer lower returns than other types of investments.Invest in corporate bonds: Corporate bonds are debt securities issued by companies. They generally offer higher returns than government bonds, but they also carry more risk, as the issuer's ability to make timely interest and principal payments is dependent on the company's financial health.Consider a money market fund: A money market fund is an investment vehicle that invests in short-term, low-risk securities such as government bonds and commercial paper. Money market funds generally offer higher returns than savings accounts, but they also carry more risk than CDs.It's important to keep in mind that all investments carry some level of risk, and it's important to carefully consider the risks and rewards of any investment before making a decision. It may also be a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or professional before making any investment decisions.","I found some UK personal accounts offer up to 3% interest (no names here, but it is well known bank with red logo).

"What is a dynamical system ? For example what does it mean to have a dynamical system model with two orthogonal rotations in state space , one at a high frequency and one at a low frequency ? Explain like I'm five.","A dynamical system is a system that changes over time. It can be described by a set of rules or equations that tell us how the system will change as time goes on.

A dynamical system model with two orthogonal rotations in state space means that there are two different ways in which the system can change. One way changes very quickly, while the other changes more slowly.

For example, imagine a toy top that you can spin. The top is a dynamical system, because it changes over time as it spins. If you give the top a little push, it will start to spin around, and it will keep spinning until it slows down and stops. The top has two different ways it can change: it can spin around its center (the high frequency rotation), and it can also tilt back and forth as it spins (the low frequency rotation). These two rotations are orthogonal, which means they are perpendicular to each other.

So, a dynamical system model with two orthogonal rotations in state space is like a toy top that can spin and tilt at the same time. It's a way of describing how the system changes over time and how it is affected by different factors.","I 'll do my best to clear this up , but this is way past 5 - year - old material . A dynamical system is a set of values that interact and change over time according to some set of fixed rules . The values could be the locations of planets , or measurements of pressure in a liquid , or number of people waiting in each line at a supermarket . The rules often are expressed in terms of "" differential equations "" . These are equations that relate the values to the speed at which the values are changing . Differential equations is a giant field of mathematics , and if you make it past calculus they 'll be waiting there for you . A dynamical system model is a simplified version of reality expressed in terms of math . For instance , when you model the motion of the solar system , you typically ignore the effects of gravity from distant stars . These models try to get all the relevant information and throw away anything that wo n't cause much of an effect . Orthogonal = perpendicular . As in , two roads at a stop sign meet orthogonally . This extends to higher dimensions as well . For instance , you could have two orthogonal planes in 3 - space , or you could have two orthogonal 3 - dimensional spaces in 4 - space . State space = the set of all possibilities for your set of values . This is typically a space that has the same dimension as the number of variables . For instance , if you were to look at the state space of the solar system , you would need 3 position and 3 velocity values at any given time for each planet . 9 planets ( PLUTO IS A PLANET , DAMMIT ) plus the sun mean that you would need a 60 dimensional space . * * In this 60 dimensional space , you could sum up the current state of the solar system with a single point . * * So , the evolution of a system over time can be represented as a point moving through a high dimensional space . Now , if you were to map all possible motions of this point through this space , you might start to see interesting patterns . For instance , you might see that if the point is in one part of the space , it will trace an orbital path around a point . This is a rotation . The speed at which this happens is its frequency . There can be many such rotations with different centers and different speeds , and the planes of rotation can be perpendicular . That would be what is happening in your sentence .

"Why are grades ( elementrary , middle , hs ) based on age and not knowledge ? Seems kind of stupid Explain like I'm five.","Grades are based on age and not just knowledge because age is a good way to divide students into groups so that they can learn at a similar pace and with students who are at a similar level. This is called age-graded education.

Imagine if all the students in a school were mixed together and had to learn the same things at the same time, regardless of their age or how much they already know. It would be very difficult for the teacher to teach and for the students to learn, because some students would be too far ahead or too far behind.

By dividing students into grades based on their age, it becomes easier for teachers to plan lessons and for students to learn, because they are all learning the same things at the same time and are at a similar level. This helps to make the learning experience more enjoyable and effective for everyone.

It's also important to note that grades are not just about knowledge. They also measure things like effort, participation, and behavior. So even if a student is very knowledgeable about a subject, they might not get a good grade if they don't put in enough effort or if they don't follow the rules.","Well , this is not the reason , but I think if this were true , many high - school people would be in 3rd grade ."
Can someone explain why currencies move up and down ? And more specifically why the British Pound and the Euro rarely move these days . Explain like I'm five.,"Sure! I'd be happy to explain why currencies move up and down, and why the British Pound and the Euro may appear to be relatively stable. To understand why currencies move, it's helpful to think about them as being like any other product or commodity that is bought and sold. Just like the price of a product or commodity can go up or down based on supply and demand, the value of a currency can also fluctuate based on the same principles. For example, if there is more demand for a particular currency (because more people want to buy it or use it to make transactions), the value of that currency may go up. On the other hand, if there is less demand for a particular currency (because fewer people want to buy it or use it to make transactions), the value of that currency may go down. There are many factors that can affect the supply and demand for a particular currency, such as the strength of a country's economy, political stability, and the level of interest rates set by the central bank. As for the British Pound and the Euro, it's important to note that these are major currencies that are used by many countries around the world. As a result, they tend to be relatively stable, especially compared to smaller or less widely-used currencies. This is because there is typically a large and consistent demand for these currencies, which helps to keep their values relatively stable. I hope this helps to explain why currencies move up and down, and why the British Pound and the Euro may appear to be relatively stable.

Airplane Windows So I was on a plane and the steward asked to open all windows during takeoff and landing . Why do they need to be open ? Explain like I'm five.,"Sure! When an airplane is taking off or landing, the windows are opened to help equalize the pressure inside the airplane with the pressure outside the airplane.

You see, when an airplane is flying at a high altitude, the air outside is much thinner than the air we breathe on the ground. This means that there is less pressure outside the airplane compared to inside. To help keep the airplane from being damaged by this difference in pressure, the windows are opened just a little bit during takeoff and landing. This helps to equalize the pressure inside and outside the airplane, so that the airplane stays strong and safe.

I hope that helps to explain why the windows need to be open during takeoff and landing! Let me know if you have any other questions.","Statistically , takeoff and landing are the most dangerous times during a flight . If there were to be an emergency , it is important for first responders to be able to see into the plane to judge conditions and locate victims ."
"How do smartphones know how to rotate correctly when "" Auto - Rotate "" is enabled ? It always interested me since I got my first smartphone years ago . Explain like I'm five. ","Smartphones use a device called a gyroscope to know how to rotate correctly when ""Auto-Rotate"" is enabled. A gyroscope is a small device that can sense the angle and orientation of a phone or other device. It works by using a spinning wheel inside of it that is able to detect even small changes in the orientation of the device.\n\nWhen ""Auto-Rotate"" is enabled on a smartphone, the gyroscope is constantly sensing the orientation of the phone. If the phone is turned from a portrait orientation (vertical) to a landscape orientation (horizontal), the gyroscope will detect this change and send a signal to the phone's software to rotate the screen accordingly. The phone's software will then rotate the screen to match the new orientation of the phone.\n\nThis is why when you turn your phone from a portrait to a landscape orientation, the screen will automatically rotate to match the new orientation. It's all thanks to the gyroscope and the phone's software working together to make sure the screen is always displayed correctly.","There 's a tiny weight suspended in springs inside your phone , it can measure where the weight is .

Should I buy out my brother on a property we will inherit before making improvements?,"It's a good idea to carefully consider all of the factors involved in buying out your brother on a property that you will inherit before making any decisions. Here are a few things to consider:Finances: Make sure you have the financial resources to buy out your brother and make any necessary improvements to the property. You may need to get a loan or mortgage to cover the cost of the buyout and renovations.Relationship with your brother: It's important to consider how buying out your brother might impact your relationship with him. If you have a good relationship and are able to communicate openly and honestly about the matter, it may be possible to come to an agreement that works for both of you.Potential value of the property: Consider the potential value of the property after making improvements. If you believe that the improvements will significantly increase the value of the property, it may be worth the investment to buy out your brother and make the renovations.Alternative options: Consider whether there are alternative options for addressing the property, such as selling it or finding a way to jointly manage and maintain it.Ultimately, the decision to buy out your brother and make improvements to the property will depend on your specific circumstances and needs. It may be helpful to speak with a financial advisor or real estate professional for guidance on the best course of action for your situation.","If your father is still able to make financial decisions and sign contracts, I see a better option. Have your father borrow against his equity to finance the renovation.  Example: the house is worth 400 now. He can borrow 100 against that. He spends it on the addition, making the house worth 500, with the same 400 of equity as before. (In some cases, spending 100 might add 150 to the house value, but let's assume here the increase is just what was spent.) When he dies, the mortgage has to be repaid. If he has no other money (that the two of you would otherwise split) then the mortgage has to be repaid by the two of you putting in cash. So you pay your brother 250 (half the new total value of the house) but he gives 50 of that to the bank for the mortgage. You also give 50 of your own money to the bank for the mortgage. Net result: your brother has 200 (the same as if he had inherited half the unimproved house), and you have a 500 house after paying out 300. Your gain is also the same as if the house was unimproved. Now if the house went up 150 by spending 100, or went up 60 by spending 100, you and your brother would also be sharing this profit or loss. If you don't want that to happen, you will need a different agreement. The advantage of the approach I'm suggesting is you just need one appraisal after your father dies.  Not accounted for in this is that you lived (without paying rent) in your father's house for some time, and that you worked (without being paid) as a caregiver to your father for that time. Some families might think those two things balanced, others might feel you need to be compensated for caring for him, and others that you need to compensate the others for your benefit of living in the large house. Be sure to discuss this with your brother so that you agree in advance whether a plan is fair or not."
"Why do cannabis and its derivatives cause paranoia to their users ? Was just wondering this , because I often see this sypmtom referenced in various TV shows , and I got curious about it . Explain like I'm five. ","Cannabis, also known as marijuana, is a psychoactive substance that is often used for recreational purposes. It contains a chemical called delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is responsible for its psychoactive effects. When THC is consumed, it can affect the way that the brain processes information and can cause changes in mood, perception, and behavior.\n\nOne of the potential side effects of using cannabis is paranoia, which is a feeling of fear or anxiety that is often accompanied by the belief that others are trying to harm or deceive you. Some people may experience paranoia after using cannabis, especially if they are using large amounts of the drug or if they are inexperienced with it.\n\nIt is not entirely clear why cannabis can cause paranoia in some people, but it is thought to be related to the way that THC affects the brain. THC can alter the way that the brain processes information and can change the levels of certain chemicals in the brain, such as dopamine and serotonin, which can affect mood and behavior. In addition, THC can interfere with the way that the brain processes and remembers events, which can lead to confusion and anxiety.\n\nIt is important to note that not everyone who uses cannabis will experience paranoia or other negative side effects. The effects of cannabis can vary from person to person, and they depend on a variety of factors, including the strain of cannabis that is being used, the method of consumption, and the individual's age, gender, and overall health. If you are considering using cannabis, it is important to be aware of the potential risks and to use it responsibly.\n","Are you talking about paranoia about being arrested and having your life ruined for smoking a plant ?

"Please explain what is ""Visible light""","Visible light is a type of electromagnetic radiation that is visible to the human eye. It has a wavelength that falls within the range of about 400 nanometers (nm) to 700 nm, which is why it is called visible light. The shorter the wavelength of the light, the higher its energy and the bluer it appears. The longer the wavelength, the lower the energy and the redder it appears.



Visible light is a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays. These types of electromagnetic radiation are all around us, but we can only see a small portion of them.



Visible light plays an important role in many aspects of our lives. It enables us to see the world around us, and it is also used in a variety of applications, such as lighting, communications, and photography.","Light or visible light is electromagnetic radiation that can be perceived by the human eye. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400–700 nanometres (nm), corresponding to frequencies of 750–420 terahertz, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths).
In physics, the term ""light"" may refer more broadly to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not. In this sense, gamma rays, X-rays, microwaves and radio waves are also light. The primary properties of light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum and polarization. Its speed in a vacuum, 299 792 458 metres a second (m/s), is one of the fundamental constants of nature. Like all types of electromagnetic radiation, visible light propagates by massless elementary particles called photons that represents the quanta of electromagnetic field, and can be analyzed as both waves and particles. The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics.
The main source of natural light on Earth is the Sun.  Historically, another important source of light for humans has been fire, from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps. With the development of electric lights and power systems, electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight."
Does anyone offer no interest loans?,"Yes, some lenders offer no interest loans or loans with very low interest rates. These loans are often offered to borrowers who are in need of financial assistance and may not have the credit score or financial history to qualify for a traditional loan.

These loans are often used to help people pay for expenses like medical bills, housing, or education.Government programs: Some government programs, such as the Small Business Administration (SBA), offer low or no interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs get the financing they need to start or grow their businesses.Credit unions: Credit unions are financial institutions that are owned and controlled by their members. Many credit unions offer low or no interest loans to their members as a way to help them meet their financial needs.It's important to note that no interest loans are often limited in availability and may have strict eligibility requirements. It's also important to carefully read the terms and conditions of any loan, including any fees or charges that may be applied.","This is very much possible and happens quite a lot. In the US, for example, promotional offers by credit card companies where you pay no interest on the balance for a certain period are a very common thing. The lender gains a new customer on such a loan, and usually earns money from the spending via the merchant fees (specifically for credit cards, at least). The pro is obviously free money. The con is that this is usually for a short period of time (longest I've seen was 15 months) after which if you're not careful, high interest rates will be charged. In some cases, interest will be charged retroactively for the whole period if you don't pay off the balance or miss the minimum payment due."

"How does knocking a person out work ? Something I 've always wondered . A good strong punch , a pistol whip to the back of the head , karate chops ... How is it all supposed to work physiologically ? Explain like I'm five.","Knocking someone out, also known as unconsciousness, occurs when the brain is deprived of oxygen and nutrients. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as when a person is hit in the head with a hard object, when their blood flow is blocked, or when their breathing is impaired.

When a person is hit in the head, the force of the impact can cause the brain to bounce around inside the skull, which can lead to injury and unconsciousness. A pistol whip or karate chop can also cause unconsciousness by hitting the person in a sensitive area of the head, such as the temple or the back of the neck.

Physiologically, unconsciousness occurs when the brain is unable to function properly due to a lack of oxygen and nutrients. When the brain is deprived of these essential substances, it shuts down and the person becomes unconscious. This is why it is important to get medical attention as soon as possible if someone has been knocked unconscious, as they may have sustained a head injury that needs to be treated.","Not a doctor , not a scientist , but it 's an overload .

what is a llc company?,"A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a type of business structure that combines the liability protection of a corporation with the tax benefits of a partnership. LLCs are popular among small business owners because they provide the personal liability protection of a corporation without the formalities and stricter regulations of a corporation.\n\nIn an LLC, the owners, also known as members, are not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business. This means that if the LLC is sued or incurs debt, the members' personal assets, such as their homes and savings, are typically protected.\n\nLLCs are relatively easy to set up and maintain, and they offer flexibility in terms of management and profit distribution. LLCs can be managed by the members themselves or by appointed managers, and profits can be distributed to the members in proportion to their ownership interests or as agreed upon by the members.\n\nLLCs are formed by filing articles of organization with the state government and obtaining an operating agreement, which outlines the management and operation of the LLC. Each state has its own rules and regulations for LLCs, so it's important to research the specific requirements in the state where the LLC will be formed.",A limited liability company (LLC) is a flexible form of enterprise that blends elements of partnership and corporate structures.An LLC is a legal form of company that provides limited liability to its owners in the vast majority of United States jurisdictions.

Social cleavage is a term that describes the different groups that exist within a society. These groups can be based on things like religion, race, ethnicity, or even social class.For example, in China, there are many different social cleavages. One cleavage might be between people who live in the city and people who live in rural areas. Another cleavage might be between people who are part of the Han Chinese ethnic group and people who are part of a different ethnic group.Social cleavages can influence how people think and what they believe, and they can also affect how people interact with each other.

"What do Brita water filters do to make "" cleaner "" water ? I see filters have those black specs ... what are they ? how do the filters "" clean "" and filter water . Explain like I'm five.","Brita water filters are designed to remove impurities from tap water. They work by using a process called filtration. Filtration is a way to separate solid particles from a liquid by passing the liquid through a filter.

The black specs in a Brita water filter are made of a material called activated carbon. Activated carbon is a type of carbon that has been treated with oxygen to make it very porous. This means that it has a lot of small holes in it, which can absorb impurities in the water as it passes through the filter.

When you pour water into the top of a Brita water filter pitcher, the water flows through the filter and passes through the activated carbon. As it passes through, the activated carbon absorbs impurities like chlorine, bacteria, and other contaminants. This helps to make the water cleaner and more pure.

After the water has passed through the filter, it comes out of the bottom of the pitcher, ready to be poured and enjoyed. So, in short, Brita water filters use activated carbon to remove impurities from tap water, making it cleaner and better tasting.","Activated Carbon . It has microscopic pores that catch other small "" things "" in the water . Does n't really make it much cleaner and stops working very soon after ."
What is the treatment for sharp pain in the testicle?Hi. I am a 29 years old man. It is for about 5-6 months that i feel pain in my left testicle as well as a sharp pain in my left Buttocks. I have done an Ultra Sound with no sign of testicular cancer. But the pain seems never to subside. Just wondering if there might be any Disk or Prostate problem involved. Thanks,"I'm sorry to hear that you have been experiencing pain in your testicle and buttocks. It is important to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment of any persistent pain.

There are several potential causes for testicle pain, including injury, infection, or underlying medical conditions such as testicular torsion, epididymitis, or hydrocele. In some cases, the pain may be related to the prostate or to problems with the lower spine or pelvis, such as a herniated disk or sciatica.

To determine the cause of your symptoms and recommend appropriate treatment, your healthcare provider will likely ask about your medical history, perform a physical examination, and possibly order additional tests, such as a CT scan or MRI.

In the meantime, you can try over-the-counter pain medication and apply cold compresses to the affected area to help alleviate discomfort. However, it is important to avoid self-diagnosing or self-treating the problem, as certain conditions, such as testicular torsion, can be serious and require immediate medical attention.

I recommend that you make an appointment with a healthcare professional as soon as possible to get a proper evaluation and treatment for your pain.","Hi, It can be due to renal calculi, take anti-inflammatory drugs and take ultrasound pelvis to conform any stones in kidney.Hope I have answered your query.

"The Arrow Paradox I read an interesting thing on Wikipedia about this thing called the Arrow Paradox , which somehow said motion was impossible . Would someone be kind enough to explain it ? I really like these kinds of things . Explain like I'm five.","Sure! The Arrow Paradox is a thought experiment that was first proposed by the ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea. It's a way of trying to understand what we mean when we talk about motion, and it suggests that motion might not be possible at all.

Imagine an arrow flying through the air. At any given moment, the arrow is in a specific place. Let's say that at time t1, the arrow is at the position x1. At time t2, the arrow is at position x2.

Now, Zeno argued that in order for the arrow to move from x1 to x2, it must first get halfway there, to a position called x1.5. And in order to get to x1.5, it must first get halfway there, to a position called x1.75. And in order to get to x1.75, it must first get halfway there, to a position called x1.875. And so on.

According to Zeno, this means that in order for the arrow to move at all, it must first travel an infinite number of distances, which is impossible. Therefore, he concluded, motion must be an illusion and is impossible.

Of course, we know that motion is possible, so Zeno's argument must be flawed somehow. Can you think of a way to explain why his argument might not be correct?","If everything is motionless at every instant , and time is entirely composed of instants , then motion is impossible ."
"What causes lump near groin?I have a lump near my groin. It seems to be a swollen lymph node but it s also showing signs of being a hernia. Is there any way I can figure it which one it may be before going to the doctor, if needed. And if it is a lymph node, will things like straining, masturbation, or further irritation make it worse?","Lumps near the groin can have a variety of causes, including swollen lymph nodes, hernias, and other conditions. It is important to have any new lump or growth checked by a healthcare provider in order to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

Swollen lymph nodes are a common cause of lumps in the groin area. Lymph nodes are part of the immune system and can become swollen in response to infection or inflammation. Straining, masturbation, and irritation are not likely to cause swollen lymph nodes, but certain activities such as heavy lifting or straining to have a bowel movement could potentially cause a hernia.

A hernia is a protrusion of an organ or tissue through a weak point in the muscle or surrounding tissue. Hernias can occur in the groin area and can cause a lump or swelling. In some cases, a hernia may be accompanied by discomfort or pain, especially when coughing, laughing, or lifting heavy objects.

It is not possible to determine the cause of a lump without a medical evaluation. If you are concerned about a lump near your groin, it is important to see a healthcare provider for an examination and proper diagnosis. They can determine the cause of the lump and recommend appropriate treatment.","Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.It could only be known by clinical examination of the lump by your family physician/general surgeon whether it is a lymph node or a hernia. A hernia would be reducible unless it has become irreducible, and also the location would be different. Straining might increase the size of a hernia, but would not cause any difference to a lymph node swelling. If the lymphadenitis is due to some kind of infection being spread by any of the draining areas like the lower limb, or genitalia, it might get smaller and relieved by anti inflammatory and antibiotic drugs, but there would be no effect on hernia by these. At the end I would advise you to get yourself assessed by your family physician or a general surgeon to be certain of the aetiology of the lump.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Dr Shareef."
Why is scalping illegal ? In terms of tickets resale . Please explain like I'm five.,"Scalping is the practice of buying tickets to an event and then reselling them at a higher price. It is often considered illegal because it can lead to inflated prices and make it more difficult for people to afford to attend events. Some places have laws against scalping because they want to make sure that tickets are available to as many people as possible, and that prices are fair. Scalping can make it harder for people to get tickets, especially if they are being sold at much higher prices than they were originally. Additionally, scalping can sometimes involve unethical or illegal practices, such as buying up large numbers of tickets and then reselling them for a profit. This can make it difficult for ordinary people to get tickets to popular events, which is why many places have laws against it. In general, it is important to follow the laws and regulations in your area when it comes to buying and selling tickets. If you are unsure about what is allowed, it is always a good idea to check with your local authorities or with the event organizers.",I did n't read the description and thought you meant the act of removing a persons scalp with a knife .

"Why do laptops slow down so much after 3 - 4 years ? Assuming no malware , viruses , etc . Explain like I'm five.","There are a few reasons why laptops may slow down after a few years of use.

First, as laptops get older, they may accumulate a lot of files, programs, and other data, which can take up space on the hard drive and cause the laptop to run more slowly.

Second, as laptops age, the components inside them can become less efficient and may not perform as well as they did when the laptop was new. For example, the processor and memory may not be able to keep up with newer, more demanding software, which can cause the laptop to slow down.

Finally, laptops can slow down if they get too hot. When laptops are used for a long time, they can generate a lot of heat, which can cause the components inside to slow down in order to prevent overheating. This can also cause the laptop to run more slowly.

Overall, there are a lot of factors that can contribute to a laptop slowing down over time. However, there are things you can do to help keep your laptop running smoothly, such as keeping it clean and well-maintained, and making sure you have enough storage space and memory.","Ditto to the previous comments .

Should I use put extra money toward paying off my student loans or investing in an index fund?,"It can be a good idea to consider both options when deciding how to use extra money. Paying off student loans may help reduce your monthly expenses and the overall cost of your debt, while investing in an index fund can potentially provide a long-term return on your investment.One approach could be to use some of the extra money to make additional payments on your student loans to reduce the balance faster and save on interest costs. You could also consider investing a portion of the extra money in an index fund, as long as you have a solid emergency fund in place to cover unexpected expenses.Ultimately, the decision will depend on your personal financial situation and goals. Some factors to consider may include:Your current financial priorities: Are you looking to reduce your debt burden as quickly as possible, or are you more focused on building wealth for the long term?Your risk tolerance: Investing in an index fund carries some level of risk, as the value of your investment may fluctuate. If you are comfortable with this risk, investing a portion of your extra money may be a good option.Your current debt burden: If you have a high level of student loan debt relative to your income, it may be a good idea to focus on paying off your loans first. On the other hand, if your debt burden is manageable, you may have more flexibility to consider other options.Your time horizon: If you have a longer time horizon, you may have more time to ride out any ups and downs in the stock market and potentially benefit from the long-term growth potential of an index fund.It can be helpful to consult with a financial advisor or planner to get a better sense of the options that make the most sense for your specific situation.","Not all debt is bad. If it carries a reasonable interest rate, you don't need to clear it immediately. As for investing in an index fund, they're an affordable, easy way to spread your money over various assets. However, asset allocation is just one of many investment strategies. Ideally, you want to invest according to your goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. You want a portfolio that dynamically allocates to various investment strategies, both beta and alpha, according to changing market conditions.

What causes pain under chest ribs and feeling air bubbles inside?Daughter is age 13 having gas bubble type pain under both sides just under her ribs. She said when she bends over the left side pain moves down in bottom of her tummy. Gave her gas relief pills. She's sleeping now. Should I worry or is this probably gas?,"Pain under the chest ribs and feeling air bubbles inside could be caused by a number of things, including gas, indigestion, or a gastrointestinal (GI) issue such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It could also be caused by a muscle strain or other soft tissue injury.

If your daughter has taken gas relief pills and is now sleeping, it is possible that the pain was caused by gas and that the medication has helped to alleviate the symptoms. However, if the pain persists or becomes more severe, it is important to consult a healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment.

In the meantime, it may be helpful to try some simple home remedies to help alleviate the pain and discomfort, such as drinking plenty of fluids, eating a healthy diet, and avoiding foods that are known to cause gas. If your daughter is experiencing constipation, over-the-counter laxatives or other remedies may be helpful.

A gastric disorder ( gastritis or gastro esophageal reflux) can't be excluded. The fact that her symptoms are modulated by the body movement is another argument in favor of these disorders, including possible musculo-skeletal pain. If her symptoms persist, I recommend consulting with the GP for a careful physical examination, a chest x ray, an abdominal ultrasound and some lab tests (complete blood count, kidney and liver function tests, fasting glucose, blood electrolytes) to rule out any other disorders related to this symptomatology.  A fibrogastroscopy may be necessary to exclude possible gastro-esophageal reflux. Hope to have been of help!Best wishes, Dr. Iliri"
Why do YouTube adverts load quicker than the video ? I always seem to find that the ads load almost instantaneously but I have to wait a while for the video to buffer and I was just wondering why ? Thanks Explain like I'm five.,"There are a few reasons why YouTube ads might seem to load faster than the video you want to watch. Here are a few possible explanations:

Advertisements are usually shorter than the videos they appear before. This means that they don't require as much data to be transferred, which can make them load more quickly.

YouTube ads are often served from fast, powerful servers that are designed to deliver content quickly. This means that the ad data can be transferred to your device more quickly, making the ad appear to load faster.

YouTube videos are often larger files than ads, which means that they require more data to be transferred. This can take longer, especially if you have a slower internet connection.

YouTube uses a system called ""adaptive streaming"" to deliver videos to you. This means that the video is divided into smaller chunks, and the quality of each chunk is adjusted based on the speed of your internet connection. If your connection is slower, it might take longer for the video to load, even if the ad has already finished playing.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.","Computer Engineer here , it always bothers me when people say that the ads load faster because of something along the lines of "" YouTube exists to make a profit "" . As much as many people would like to believe it , they are not purposefully giving the ads a better connection . barc0de had the right answer , but let me explain it a bit more . The internet is big , so big that most large websites like Amazon or YouTube get millions of hits per day or even per hour . If the company had to deal with this load itself , they would need to acquire a lot of servers and update their infrastructure so that people could get fast connections to their servers . No company really wants to do this though , so companies like Akamai were born . What Akamai does is it has servers placed all around the world ( over 200,000 ) that cache website data for people who pay to have their data cached . * Caching data is essentially copying it to a location that is faster to access , the benefits emerge when you access that data often , for example if you have data you need to load 1001 times , you could load it once ( say it takes 10 seconds ) and then you cache it , then when you go to load it again and because it is now in a location that loads faster it only takes 1 second . You can now load the data in 1010 seconds ( 10 * 1 + 1 * 1000 ) rather than 10010 seconds ( 10 * 1001 ) * Back to Akamai ... basically they intelligently cache data for companies that pay for their services ( I believe YouTube is one of those ) . Lets say a person asks the internet for a YouTube page , their computer will actually ask the closest Akamai server if it has that page , let us pretend that the server says no , the server will then get the page from YouTube and pass it along to them . That will take a while because their connection had to go all the way to YouTube which is comparatively slow . Now we have a second person who is loading the same page and lives close enough to person 1 to be connecting to the same Akamai server . They will ask for the page and the server may have it cached and therefore can provide it in a much faster manner because the server does n't have to connect to YouTube 's servers . The problem comes in when Akamai realizes that it does n't have the space to cache every page that every user requests . So what happens is they cache the most frequently loaded aspects of the page and then ask YouTube for the rest . ( stuff like YouTube 's logo and the code for the search bar as these are on every page so they can cache one copy and save time when loading any youtube page ) This also includes ads as often there are only 100 or so ads currently in the cycle . So in reality , so many people have asked for the ad in comparison to the video ( because multiple videos can have the same ads ) that the akamai server automatically caches the ads because they are being asked for more and the server only has so much room that it will store only the things being asked for the most . So when person 2 went to load the page the akamai server would actually just have the ad and other things constant to the YouTube website cached and load the video from YouTube 's servers . You in this case are person 2 . So while yes , technically "" YouTube exists to make a profit "" and therefore wo n't upgrade their servers past what is just barely tolerable , the ads do not load faster than the rest because YouTube gives them special privileges . Also I for one am very grateful YouTube enlists the help of akamai as otherwise the rest of the page would load just as slow as the video . tl;dr : Ads are stored in local servers and therefore faster , videos are to big and to many to be stored locally . ( Holy wall of text ... I may have gone a bit overboard ... )"

Moles can appear anywhere on your body and can be any size or shape. Some people are born with moles, while others may develop moles later in life. Moles can appear all of a sudden because they are caused by a combination of factors, including your genes, sun exposure, and hormones. It's not uncommon for people to develop new moles as they age.

Capital losses on early-purchased stock?,"If you sell stock that you purchased at an earlier date for a price that is lower than what you paid for it, you have incurred a capital loss. For example, if you bought stock for $100 and later sell it for $80, you have a capital loss of $20. Capital losses can be used to offset capital gains from the sale of other securities or investments, which can reduce the amount of tax you owe. However, if your capital losses exceed your capital gains, you can only use a maximum of $3,000 of excess capital losses to offset other income on your tax return in a given year. Any remaining excess capital losses can be carried forward to future tax years.It's important to note that the timing of when you sell the stock can affect whether you have a capital gain or loss. If you sell the stock within a year of purchasing it, the capital gain or loss is considered to be short-term. If you hold the stock for longer than a year before selling it, the capital gain or loss is considered to be long-term. Short-term capital gains and losses are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate, while long-term capital gains and losses may be taxed at a lower rate, depending on your tax bracket.","Yes When exercising a stock option you will be buying the stock at the strike price so you will be putting up your money, if you lose that money you can declare it as a loss like any other transaction. So if the stock is worth $1 and you have 10 options with a strike at $0.50 you will spend $500 when you exercise your options. If you hold those shares and the company is then worth $0 you lost $500. I have not verified my answer so this is solely from my understanding of accounting and finance. Please verify with your accountant to be sure."
"Why is Internet Explorer the worst browser to use ? ... and why are all the other browsers considered to be so much "" better "" ? Explain like I'm five.","Internet Explorer is a web browser that was once very popular, but it is no longer considered to be the best choice for a few reasons. First, Internet Explorer is not as fast as some of the newer browsers. This means that it can take longer to load websites and perform other tasks. Second, Internet Explorer is not as secure as some of the other browsers. It is more prone to getting viruses and other types of malware, which can be harmful to your computer and steal your personal information. Finally, Internet Explorer is not as compatible with modern websites as some of the other browsers. Many websites are designed to work best with newer browsers, and may not function properly or look as good in Internet Explorer. Other browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari, are generally considered to be better because they are faster, more secure, and more compatible with modern websites.","With the release of Internet Explorer 9 , IE has made huge strides forward , but still lacks behind Firefox and Google Chrome . * * Rendering :* * Websites are written in a special language called [ HTML ] ( URL_7 ) . This language has [ rules ] ( URL_4 ) , such as what words [ are allowed ] ( URL_4 # auto - toc-4 ) and how to display those words . These rules are created and maintained by a neutral organization called the [ W3C ] ( URL_6 ) , or the [ World Wide Web Consortium ] ( URL_6 ) . Now , web browsers are supposed to listen to the rules created by the W3C , so a website will look the same in every browser . Unfortunately , Internet Explorer 6 & 7 ( being the worst offenders ) often [ do n't listen to the rules ] ( URL_2 ) created by the W3C. This means a website that is correctly written looks proper in browsers like [ Firefox ] ( URL_5 ) and [ Google Chrome ] ( URL_0 ) because those browsers listen to the rules , but not in IE6 or IE7 . This means that the people building sites either ca n't use [ certain words ] ( URL_3 ) because IE wo n't understand them even though they are right , or they have to use words that [ only IE understands ] ( URL_1 ) which means the language is no longer "" right "" .

How are the clicky tops which let you know the drink has been open made on bottles ? Are the drinks bottled in a high pressure factory or something ? I did n't know what to google exactly ... Sorry ! . Explain like I'm five.,"The clicky tops that let you know when a drink has been opened are called ""tamper-evident caps"" or ""tamper-evident seals."" These caps are typically made from plastic and have a small, thin tab or ""flange"" that sticks out from the top of the cap. When the cap is first put on the bottle, the flange is pressed down and becomes flush with the rest of the cap. If the cap is then opened, the flange will pop back up, letting you know that the bottle has been opened.

To make these tamper-evident caps, plastic pellets are melted and molded into the desired shape using a machine called an injection molding machine. The molded caps are then cooled and removed from the mold, and the flange is added. The caps are then inspected to make sure they are free of defects, and they are packed into boxes and shipped to bottling plants.

The bottles themselves are usually made of glass or plastic and are made using a different process called blow molding. In this process, hot, molten plastic is poured into a mold and then inflated with air to form the shape of the bottle. The bottles are then cooled and removed from the mold.

The drinks are usually bottled at a bottling plant, not a high pressure factory. The bottling process involves filling the bottles with the drink using a filling machine, and then sealing the bottles with the tamper-evident caps. The bottles are then inspected, labeled, and packed into boxes or onto pallets for shipping.",I 'm not sure with drinks but I know food in jars is often sealed whilst it is hot .

Why the new World Trade Center is n't built yet . Why is it taking so .... damn ..... long ? ? Explain like I'm five.,"The construction of the new World Trade Center (WTC) in New York City has taken a long time for several reasons. One reason is that the project is very complex and involves building several large and intricate structures. This means that it takes a lot of time to design, plan, and build the buildings and other structures that make up the WTC.

Another reason that the construction of the new WTC has taken so long is that there have been many challenges and setbacks along the way. For example, the project has had to deal with issues related to funding, political approvals, and other logistical challenges. Additionally, the site of the new WTC is the location of the former World Trade Center, which was destroyed in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. As a result, the construction of the new WTC has had to take into account the emotional and symbolic significance of the site, which has added an extra layer of complexity to the project.

Overall, the construction of the new WTC has been a long and complex process, but it is now nearly complete and will be a symbol of resilience and renewal for the city of New York.","Cleanup took a really long time , and the property where the former towers stood is private property . Negotiating and planning to rebuild a skyscraper takes a long time . Plus , there was lots of infighting about how to best pay tribute to the former towers and all the people that were inside them . Not so with the Pentagon , which was Government property . Once they agreed on a memorial it was just a matter of getting a construction company on contract ."
How does salt act as preservative in food ? And does food gets less salty as time passes ? Explain like I'm five.,"Salt is a preservative in food because it helps to prevent the growth of bacteria. Bacteria need water to grow, and salt helps to remove water from the environment. When salt is added to food, it draws out some of the water and creates an environment that is less hospitable for bacteria to grow. This can help to extend the shelf life of the food.

As for the second part of your question, it is possible for food to become less salty over time. This can happen if the food is stored in a humid environment, as the salt may dissolve in the water and be absorbed by the food. It can also happen if the food is cooked or processed in a way that removes some of the salt. However, in general, the salt content of food does not change significantly over time unless it is actively being removed.","Salt kills bacteria and molds by drying them out . The growth of bacteria and molds is what makes your food go bad , so inhibiting the growth of those stops your food from going bad . And no , the food does not get less salty as time passes . Maybe the salt becomes more evenly distributed , but the amount of salt remains the same ."
"Please explain what is ""Database model""","A database model is a way of organizing and structuring data in a database. It determines how data is stored, related, and accessed. There are several different types of database models, including:



Relational model: This model stores data in tables, which are organized into rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents a field. The relational model is based on the mathematical concept of a relation, which is a set of tuples (rows) with a unique identifier (primary key).



Hierarchical model: This model stores data in a tree-like structure, with a parent-child relationship between records. Each record has a single parent record, except for the root record, which has no parent.



Network model: This model is similar to the hierarchical model, but allows multiple parent-child relationships between records.



Object-oriented model: This model stores data as objects, which are self-contained units of data and behavior. Objects are organized into classes, which define their properties and methods.



Entity-relationship model: This model is used to represent the relationships between different entities (such as customers, orders, and products) in a database. It is often used as a conceptual model, and is then translated into a specific database model, such as the relational model.



Choosing the right database model for a particular application depends on the requirements of the application, the amount and type of data, and the expected workload.","A database model is a type of data model that determines the logical structure of a database. It fundamentally determines in which manner data can be stored, organized and manipulated. The most popular example of a database model is the relational model, which uses a table-based format."
"Please explain what is ""Edward Snowden""","Edward Snowden is a former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor who, in 2013, disclosed classified information about the agency's surveillance activities to journalists. The information revealed that the NSA was collecting and storing vast amounts of data from telephone and internet communications, including those of American citizens, without their knowledge or consent.



Snowden's disclosures sparked a widespread debate about government surveillance and privacy, and he has been hailed by some as a hero and a whistleblower for bringing these activities to light. Others, however, view him as a traitor and a criminal for revealing classified information.



In the aftermath of his disclosures, Snowden fled the United States and has been living in exile in Russia since 2013. He faces charges in the United States for theft of government property and for violating the Espionage Act.","Edward Joseph Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American and naturalized Russian former computer intelligence consultant who leaked highly classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013, when he was an employee and subcontractor. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes intelligence alliance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments and prompted a cultural discussion about national security and individual privacy.
In 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. Snowden says he gradually became disillusioned with the programs with which he was involved, and that he tried to raise his ethical concerns through internal channels but was ignored. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii, and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, Barton Gellman, and Ewen MacAskill. Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian, The Washington Post, and other publications. Snowden also made extensive allegations against the GCSB, blowing the whistle of their domestic surveillance of New Zealanders and acts of espionage under John Key's government.
On June 21, 2013, the United States Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property, following which the Department of State revoked his passport. Two days later, he flew into Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport, where Russian authorities observed the canceled passport, and he was restricted to the airport terminal for over one month. Russia later granted Snowden the right of asylum with an initial visa for residence for one year, which was subsequently repeatedly extended. In October 2020, he was granted permanent residency in Russia. In September 2022, Snowden was granted Russian citizenship by President Vladimir Putin,[10] and on 2 December 2022 he swore the oath of allegiance.[11]
A subject of controversy, Snowden has been variously called a traitor,[12] a hero,[13] a whistleblower,[14] a dissident,[15] a coward,[16] and a patriot.[17] U.S. officials condemned his actions as having done ""grave damage"" to the U.S. intelligence capabilities.[18] Snowden has defended his leaks as an effort ""to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them.""[19] His disclosures have fueled debates over mass surveillance, government secrecy, and the balance between national security and information privacy, something that he has said he intended to do in retrospective interviews.[20]
In early 2016, Snowden became the president of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, a San Francisco–based nonprofit organization that aims to protect journalists from hacking and government surveillance.[21] He also has a job at an unnamed Russian IT company.[22] In 2017, he married Lindsay Mills. ""I have to lay my head down in Moscow on a pillow at night,"" he told an Israeli audience in November 2018, ""but I live on the internet and every other city in the world.""[23] On September 17, 2019, his memoir Permanent Record was published.[24] On September 2, 2020, a U.S. federal court ruled in United States v. Moalin that the U.S. intelligence's mass surveillance program exposed by Snowden was illegal and possibly unconstitutional.[25]"
"Why is it not illegal to belong to a gang ? If law enforcement and the different levels of the government know that gangs engage in criminal activity , why is someone not charged simply for belonging to a criminal organization ? Please explain like I'm five.","In most countries, it is not illegal to belong to a gang in and of itself. However, being a member of a gang can make it more likely that a person will engage in criminal activity, and if a person does commit a crime while they are a member of a gang, they may face additional penalties or consequences. This is because being a member of a gang can sometimes be seen as evidence of a person's involvement in criminal activity. 
In addition, many countries have laws that allow authorities to take action against gangs if they are found to be engaging in criminal activity. For example, a gang might be labeled as a ""criminal organization"" and members could be charged with participating in or supporting the criminal activities of the gang. 
It is important to note that being a member of a gang does not automatically mean that a person has committed a crime, and a person cannot be charged with a crime simply for belonging to a gang. However, if a person is found to have participated in or supported criminal activity while they were a member of a gang, they can be charged with crimes related to that activity.",Because the First Amendment ( in the US ) means you ca n't be arrested for your associations .

"How to treat the pain caused in the sternum for a person having bilateral mastectomy?I was diagnosed with Stage 2A breast cancer in February 2011.  I have had a bilateral mastectomy and chemotherapy and now have saline breast implants.  For the past few days, I have been experiencing pain between the 5th and 6th ribs to the left of my sternum.  The pain is worse when I breathe.  Is this costochondritis?  A problem with the implants?  Metastasis?  Please give me your thoughts.  Thank you.","I'm sorry to hear about your breast cancer diagnosis and the pain you are experiencing. It is possible that the pain you are experiencing could be caused by costochondritis, which is inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the sternum. This condition can be caused by physical strain, respiratory infections, or underlying medical conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or fibromyalgia.

It is also possible that the pain could be related to your breast implants. If the implants are causing discomfort or pain, it is important to speak with your doctor about your symptoms. It is also important to rule out the possibility of metastasis, or the spread of cancer to other parts of the body. If you are experiencing other symptoms in addition to the pain in your sternum, or if the pain is severe or persists for an extended period of time, it is important to speak with your doctor as soon as possible.

In the meantime, there are a few things you can try to help alleviate the pain:

Rest: Try to avoid activities that cause or exacerbate the pain, and take breaks to rest as needed.

Apply heat or cold: Applying heat or cold to the affected area can help reduce inflammation and pain. You can use a heating pad, hot water bottle, or warm compress, or try taking a warm bath or shower. Alternatively, you can try applying an ice pack wrapped in a towel to the affected area for short periods of time.

Take over-the-counter pain medication: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve) can help reduce inflammation and pain. Be sure to follow the instructions on the label and speak with your doctor before taking any medication.

Practice good posture: Maintaining good posture can help reduce strain on the chest muscles and ribs. Try to keep your shoulders relaxed and avoid slouching or hunching over.

Stretch: Gentle stretches can help to reduce muscle tension and improve flexibility. You can try stretching your chest muscles by standing with your arms at your sides and your palms facing forward. Slowly lift your arms up and back as far as is comfortable, keeping your elbows straight. Hold the stretch for a few seconds and then release.

I hope this information is helpful. It is important to speak with your doctor if you are experiencing persistent or severe pain, or if you have any other concerns about your health.","Hi,Thanks for writing in.The pain in costochondritis is typically in the front of chest next to the sternum and might cause lot of distress. It is a sharp pain.Breast implants can cause irritation of the nerves in the anterior chest wall causing pain perception. This pain is more localized to the area where implants are present and usually does not radiate to other places.Metastasis is pain due to bone destruction. This is diffuse pain which increases on palpation and focused on the area overlying the bone.It is suggested that you get a chest X ray or CT scan done to evaluate in detail the cause and nature of problem leading to the pain."
Why do Mount Everest Climbers not go / climb around the Khumbu Icefall ? I 've been watching a lot of Mountaineering documentaries but I know nothing . Halp . Explain like I'm five. ,"The Khumbu Icefall is a very dangerous area on the route to the summit of Mount Everest. It is a section of the mountain where there is a lot of moving ice, and the ice can be very unstable. Climbers have to cross through this area to get to the higher parts of the mountain, but it is very risky to do so. If the ice moves, it can cause a climber to fall or be crushed. Many climbers have been injured or killed in the Khumbu Icefall, so most climbers try to avoid it if possible.","Plenty of climbers do - anyone who takes the [ North Col Route ] ( URL_0 ) avoids the Icefall entirely . The main troubles with that route are that it 's longer and more difficult , and that it starts on the Tibetan side of the mountain , which was closed to foreigners for decades . I 'm not actually sure how easy it is to get into Tibet nowadays . So for those reasons , the South Col route is the better - known and more well - traveled . The Icefall is dangerous , but it 's really the best and easiest way up the mountain from that side , so climbers just have to take precautions to make it as safe as possible ."
If forensics try to match a bullet to a barrell based on markings . Why not record the barrell before sale and index the markings ? Probably because over time the barrell of the gun will change but it could be helpful Please explain like I'm five.,"There are a few reasons why it might not be practical to record the markings on a gun barrel before it is sold: 
1. Cost: It would be expensive to record and store the markings on every single gun barrel that is produced. 
2. Time: It would take a lot of time to record and store the markings on every single gun barrel, which could slow down the production process. 
3. Effectiveness: Even if the markings on a gun barrel are recorded before it is sold, the barrel may still wear down or become damaged over time, which could alter the markings. Additionally, it is not always possible to get a clear, accurate reading of the markings on a gun barrel, especially if the barrel is damaged or dirty. 
4. Privacy concerns: Some people may be concerned about their personal information being recorded and stored in a database, especially if it is related to their firearms. 
Overall, while it might be helpful to record and index the markings on a gun barrel, it is not a practical solution for forensic investigators.","Matching a bullet to a gun by barrel marks borders on impossible . Constant changes to cleanliness , heat stress , wear and tear ..... even variables in ammunition quality .... in a court of law , the best a forensics person could say is the bullet is consistent with the gun type , but could never with 100 percent certainty say that x bullet came out of y gun ."

"Why ca n't we do lethal injection by just injecting air into the bloodstream ? If we 're running out of the drugs , would n't this be relatively cheap ? Please explain like I'm five.","Injecting air into the bloodstream, also known as air embolism, is not a safe or effective method of lethal injection. 
Air embolism occurs when an air bubble enters a blood vessel and blocks the flow of blood. This can be extremely dangerous and potentially fatal, as the air bubble can travel to the heart or brain and cause serious problems. 
Furthermore, injecting air into the bloodstream does not provide a quick and painless death. On the contrary, it can cause a person to experience severe pain, panic, and distress as their body struggles to deal with the air bubble. 
In summary, injecting air into the bloodstream is not a viable option for lethal injection because it is not safe and can cause a person to experience significant suffering.",Takes longer it 's sloppier and far more painful .
Why is it easier to stay up late than to get up early ? Why is it easier to stay up until 5 am than it is to wake up at 5 am ? Are there ways to transform from night owl to morning person ? Explain like I'm five.,"It can be easier to stay up late because your body naturally produces a hormone called melatonin that helps you feel sleepy. When it gets later at night, your body makes more melatonin, which can make you feel more tired. On the other hand, in the morning, your body's melatonin levels are usually low, which can make it harder to wake up.

There are ways you can try to become a morning person, but it might take some time and effort. Here are a few things you can try:

Go to bed at the same time every night: This can help your body get into a routine, which can make it easier to wake up in the morning.

Avoid screens before bed: The light from screens can interfere with your body's production of melatonin, so it's a good idea to avoid screens for at least an hour before you go to bed.

Get some sunlight in the morning: Sunlight can help your body's natural clock (called your circadian rhythm) reset, which can make it easier to wake up.

Gradually adjust your bedtime: If you're used to going to bed late, try moving your bedtime a little bit earlier each night until you're able to wake up at the time you want.

It might take some time and patience, but with practice and consistency, you can try to become a morning person.","Newtons first law of motion . > An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force .

"How did the first language come about ? Edit : Thank you all for your inputs , and I was talking about spoken language . Explain like I'm five. ","Spoken language is a way for people to communicate with each other using sounds and words. It is not exactly known how the first spoken language came about, but it is believed that it developed gradually over a long period of time as humans evolved and became more intelligent.\n\nOne theory is that as humans learned to make and use tools, they also developed the ability to communicate with each other in more complex ways. This may have included using sounds to represent different objects or actions, and combining these sounds to form words. Over time, these sounds and words would have become more refined and organized into a system of communication that we now recognize as language.\n\nAnother theory is that language developed as a way for humans to express their thoughts and feelings to each other. This would have allowed them to form stronger social bonds and work together more effectively.\n\nRegardless of how it began, it is clear that language has played a crucial role in the development of human society and culture. It has allowed us to share ideas, tell stories, and pass down knowledge from one generation to the next.","Since we did n't have writing until much later , it 's all speculation .

What keeps humanity 's genders ' populations roughly 50/50 with each other ? Why not more females ? Males ? Please explain like I'm five.,"Humanity's gender populations are roughly 50/50 because that is the way that nature has designed it. For most species, including humans, males and females have different reproductive roles. In humans, males typically produce sperm and females produce eggs. In order for a baby to be conceived, a sperm must fertilize an egg. Since males and females have different reproductive roles, it is necessary for both to be present in roughly equal numbers in order for reproduction to be successful.There are a few reasons why there might be slight variations in the number of males and females in a population. For example, certain environmental factors can affect the survival rate of males and females differently. Additionally, cultural and societal practices can also influence the ratio of males to females in a population. However, overall, the roughly 50/50 ratio of males to females is due to the biological realities of reproduction and the fact that both males and females are necessary for the continuation of a species.","If you ignore all the politics , culture , religion , biology , life , etc : Just by reproduction , there 's a 50/50 chance of the baby being a boy or a girl . When the sperm is made , there 's an equal number of X and Y sperm .

Recommendation for learning fundamental analysis?,"Fundamental analysis is a method of evaluating the intrinsic value of an asset by examining its underlying economic and financial factors. It involves analyzing a company's financial statements, such as its balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement, as well as other factors such as its management, competitive advantage, and industry trends.If you're interested in learning fundamental analysis, here are a few steps you can follow:Start by learning the basic concepts and terminology of financial analysis, such as profitability ratios, liquidity ratios, and debt ratios.Learn how to read and interpret financial statements. This will involve understanding the different components of each statement and how they relate to one another.Familiarize yourself with the tools and techniques used in fundamental analysis, such as discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, relative valuation, and intrinsic value calculations.Practice analyzing real-world companies by pulling their financial statements and applying the concepts and techniques you have learned.Consider taking a course or obtaining a certification in financial analysis to gain a more in-depth understanding of the subject.Keep up with industry news and developments to stay informed about the companies and sectors you are analyzing.I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.","Below is just a little information on this topic from my small unique book ""The small stock trader"":  The most significant non-company-specific factor affecting stock price is the market sentiment, while the most significant company-specific factor is the earning power of the company. Perhaps it would be safe to say that technical analysis is more related to psychology/emotions, while fundamental analysis is more related to reason – that is why it is said that fundamental analysis tells you what to trade and technical analysis tells you when to trade. Thus, many stock traders use technical analysis as a timing tool for their entry and exit points. Technical analysis is more suitable for short-term trading and works best with large caps, for stock prices of large caps are more correlated with the general market, while small caps are more affected by company-specific news and speculation…: Perhaps small stock traders should not waste a lot of time on fundamental analysis; avoid overanalyzing the financial position, market position, and management of the focus companies. It is difficult to make wise trading decisions based only on fundamental analysis (company-specific news accounts for only about 25 percent of stock price fluctuations). There are only a few important figures and ratios to look at, such as: perhaps also: Furthermore, single ratios and figures do not tell much, so it is wise to use a few ratios and figures in combination. You should look at their trends and also compare them with the company’s main competitors and the industry average. Preferably, you want to see trend improvements in these above-mentioned figures and ratios, or at least some stability when the times are tough. Despite all the exotic names found in technical analysis, simply put, it is the study of supply and demand for the stock, in order to predict and follow the trend. Many stock traders claim stock price just represents the current supply and demand for that stock and moves to the greater side of the forces of supply and demand.  If you focus on a few simple small caps, perhaps you should just use the basic principles of technical analysis, such as:  I have no doubt that there are different ways to make money in the stock market. Some may succeed purely on the basis of technical analysis, some purely due to fundamental analysis, and others from a combination of these two like most of the great stock traders have done (Jesse Livermore, Bernard Baruch, Gerald Loeb, Nicolas Darvas, William O’Neil, and Steven Cohen). It is just a matter of finding out what best fits your personality.  I hope the above little information from my small unique book was a little helpful! Mika (author of ""The small stock trader"")"
"Why gravity pulls in objects By that , I mean , why do objects of greater mass have more gravity ? Why does gravity attract objects in the first place ? Explain like I'm five.","Gravity is the force that pulls objects towards each other. It is what makes things fall down to the ground when you drop them.

The reason why objects with greater mass have more gravity is because they have more mass, which means they have more matter packed into them. The more matter an object has, the more gravity it has. This is why the Earth, which has a lot of mass, has a lot of gravity and can pull smaller things towards it.

But why does gravity attract objects in the first place? Well, it all has to do with the way that matter is made up. Matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms, and these atoms have a lot of mass. When two objects are near each other, their atoms are attracted to each other because of their mass. This is what causes gravity.

So to sum it up, gravity is the force that pulls objects towards each other because their atoms are attracted to each other due to their mass. Objects with more mass have more gravity because they have more atoms packed into them, which means they have more mass and more gravity.","Imagine you have a ten pound bowling ball in the center of a trampoline . The bowling ball is heavy enough to make the surface of the trampoline bend down due to it weight . if you were to place tennis ball along the edge of the trampoline where the bend is n't that bad then the tennis ball probably wo n't move , or move pretty slowly towards the center at the start . Now if you placed the tennis ball closer to the bowling ball it will move faster to the bowling ball because of the bend in the trampoline . If you changed the ten pound bowling ball with a hundred pound ball the bend will be deeper and larger . Now imagine the bend in the trampoline is gravity , heavier objects make larger bends in it and can pull in more objects from farther distances closer . The trampoline in this example is space - time ."
"When does a ticket become a misdemeanor , and a misdemeanor become a felony ? I 've never known the criteria to see how a crime fits into a specific category . Explain like I'm five.","In the United States, a crime is generally considered a misdemeanor if it is punishable by a fine or imprisonment in a county or local jail, rather than in a state or federal prison. Misdemeanors are typically less serious crimes than felonies, and they often carry a maximum sentence of up to one year in jail. Examples of misdemeanors include petty theft, simple assault, and driving under the influence (DUI).

On the other hand, a crime is generally considered a felony if it is punishable by imprisonment in a state or federal prison. Felonies are typically more serious crimes than misdemeanors, and they often carry a maximum sentence of more than one year in prison. Examples of felonies include murder, rape, and aggravated assault.

In some cases, the severity of a crime may be determined by the circumstances surrounding it. For example, a simple assault may be charged as a misdemeanor if it involves a minor injury, but it may be charged as a felony if it involves a serious injury or the use of a deadly weapon.

In general, the criteria for determining whether a crime is a misdemeanor or a felony depend on the laws of the state where the crime was committed and the nature of the crime itself.","Only criminal offenses are misdemeanors or felonies . That 's why you hear people say things like pot has been decriminalized . It 's still illegal , but not a criminal offense . We will get back to this as soon as I take care of the easy ones . A criminal offense , according to the Constitution , gives the accused a lot of rights . Among these are the right to an attorney , the right to a judge and jury , and the right to know what you are accused of . When you are accused of a criminal offense , you will usually hear your rights read to you . You will also have a mug shot taken and your fingerprints ran . All of your rights according to the Constitution are provided to you . The difference between a misdemeanor and a felony is nothing more than the maximum sentence you can get for the crime . Generally , a misdemeanor can get you a sentence of no more than one year in jail and a maximum fine . A lot of jurisdictions have some variances on the maximum amount of a fine and the maximum amount of jail time . But the thing to take from this is you ca n't get a life sentence for a misdemeanor . A felony , on the other hand , has no limits . If you commit a felony , you could get one or even multiple life sentences . You could even get the death penalty . The fine can be in the millions of dollars if the court finds the penalty appropriate . The thing to take from this is a felony has unlimited punishment within the limits of the law . Back to non - criminal offenses . The courts figured out a long time ago that there are a lot of things that people should n't be doing , but the courts did n't want to take a lot of time to clear these things up . You do n't get the rights specified in the Constitution ( though most courts will still respect your rights ) , and you do n't have to be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt . All that has to be shown is that a reasonable person would believe you did what you were accused of . Generally , the maximum penalty is a fine . Non - criminal offenses are a compromise , granted , but imagine if you had to sit on a jury for a bunch of speeding tickets ."
How a minimum wage hike would push the cost of everything up in the US but has n't elsewhere . Is it just right wing scare logic ? Please explain like I'm five.,"The idea behind the minimum wage hike is that it would increase the amount of money that low-wage workers have to spend on goods and services. This increase in demand for goods and services could lead to higher prices for those goods and services, as businesses try to cover the higher labor costs by charging more for their products. However, this effect is not necessarily a given. There are many factors that can influence the relationship between minimum wage and prices, such as the overall strength of the economy, the availability of labor and capital, and the degree of competition in different markets. In some cases, businesses may be able to absorb the higher labor costs without raising prices, by finding ways to become more efficient or by passing on the costs to other stakeholders, such as shareholders or customers in other countries. It's also worth noting that the relationship between minimum wage and prices can vary depending on the specific context. For example, a minimum wage hike might have a larger impact on prices in a market with high labor costs and relatively low competition, compared to a market with low labor costs and high competition. So, to answer your question, it is not necessarily ""right wing scare logic"" to suggest that a minimum wage hike could lead to higher prices. However, it is also not a given that this will always happen, and the magnitude of the effect can vary depending on the specific circumstances.","I can give an objective opinion as an economist typically categorized as "" conservative / libertarian / capitalist / wacko "" in a political discussion . I 'm also European so my perspective is a bit different here and I have no political preferences when it comes to US political circus . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ What is wrong with your question / suggestion is that it tries to understand the problem from the same biased , narrow - minded perspective as most of the opponents of minimum wage hike on Fox or CBS business or whatever . The problem with minimum wage is n't whether it would increase cost of goods or services . The problem is how it would effect the everyday workings of the economy how it would affect the way companies hire people , which companies struggle and which do n't , which jobs would disappear temporarily and which permanently . The economy as a whole is a huge resilient system that can handle and take a lot . It 's the little people however who can have their whole lives turned upside down by one small change . To respond to your main question however - In most cases the price increase would be minimal if the minimum wage did not exceed $ 10 - 11 for the expensive states ( Conn. , Mass. , NY , Ca . ) and $ 8 - 9 for the cheaper states ( Tex . Miss. ) It probably would n't change too much if it went 12 and 10 dollars respectively . Some businesses which rely on low minimum wage to make additional profit would find themselves in trouble but they would n't be able to raise the prices too much because the competition would quickly get in and drive them out of business . Of course by "" quickly "" I mean 3 - 5 years . So it would definitely cause a small increase in otherwise stable prices - it would be simply necessary for most businesses to wither the transition and re - arrange their costs and revenue streams - but it would n't be a huge increase ( unless a company used it as an excuse to rise prices ) because labour costs are not the most problematic factor in America because of its liberal employment law . It would only force companies to manage their employees more efficiently and being able to fire and hire at will is a good thing in such a situation . So to answer your question * partly * - no , the price increase would be insignificant and it 's mostly Pavlovian response and overblown scare because what it would do is eat into current profit margins for many businesses . However there are the other problems which * really * need addressing . In this sense focusing on "" prices will rise "" is really a diversion rather than addressing the real problem . ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Three of them are the most significant : * * * It would disproportionately hit lowest - skilled employees and impoverished communities * * - mainly black - which already struggle for many reasons and unfortunately are not perceived as reliable labour . It 's likely illegal employment would take a chunk of the labour market there whenever possible . Also most economically unproductive employees would be laid off to take the heat of the company . Some temporarily , some permanently . We need to remember that raising the minimum wage does n't help if you do n't have the job anymore . * * * It would disproportionately hit small businesses * * , especially those which are managed poorly ( most of them ) . A large company such as Wal - Mart or Target can deal with it because they have stable credit lines , cash reserves etc . A small pizzeria in a resort town might get in trouble if the hike is too big - say 50 % ( $ 7.25 to $ 11 ) . It would help the big chains to get a bigger chunk of the local market - where it exists . * * * It would reinforce the incorrect , erroneous belief that everything can be resolved by just "" paying workers more "" . * * The current problem with cost of living in America is related to the falling purchasing power of the dollar which has dropped dramatically in the last two - three decades . The process ( known in economics as * Cantillon effect * ) is very closely related to the explosion in the ubiquity of consumer credit and the push from finance industry for further "" deregulation "" ( which is n't deregulation at all ) . This drives the prices of everything up in a very asymmetric manner and makes people more and more dependent on loans instead of their earnings . There is a reason why so many left - wing billionaires and financiers were fine with OWS movement . This movement did not address the fundamental issues of how and why they get so rich but only demanded that they * share * their profits . That 's fine for a business . You have to remember one of the most basic laws of economics : * * every intermediate cost is passed over to the customer in the long run * * . If they have to share more they 'll steal more from you in return and there 's nothing you can do because they 've bought up the congress . Not you . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ That third problem - it is important on a whole different level . It 's like confusing the rationale behind the war on terror vs whether some Islamists in Syria currently making a mess are a problem . By pretending that all that 's necessary is just a minimum wage hike you divert much needed attention from inflationary practices of the financial sector and the government completely messing up the whole economy and into the worn - out cliche of evil capitalists exploiting poor workers . A distorted debate where spokespeople for businesses will demand freezing of minimum wage ( for their benefit ) and union reps will demand a 100 % hike ( for their benefit ) and both sides engage in finger - pointing is precisely what is wrong with considering the issue of some people having a hard time making ends meet in shitty jobs on shitty wages . People need to understand that when you need a raise because you ca n't make the ends meet anymore it usually means that something is really really wrong with the economy ( unless you became really irresponsible with the money ) . So it * * ca n't * * be papered over with a temporary hike in your earnings because the same problem which made your initial sufficient wage suddenly insufficient will come back in a year or so ... Fix the problem - not the symptom . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ In the end however a minimum wage hike might not be such a bad idea in the * * practical sense * * , especially if its matched by some tax relief targeted at the smallest businesses to let them adjust better in the short term . The federal government is throwing trillions at the big players but they skimp every dollar on the poor . But most importantly the hike should be gradual and tied to the actual cost of living in a state . Perhaps increase it by 10 % every year for 5 years ? That would be $ 11.67 for current $ 7.25 . That 's a bit too high ... perhaps 5 % then ... Now you have to run it against cost of living in Connecticut and Missouri so it does n't strangle the small business sector in Missouri while leaving people in Connecticut wanting an additional buck or so . So I guess that would require re - working of current federal minimum wage laws?The minimum wage should n't be an arbitrary number - it needs to cover the * minimum requirement * . Which is bullshit anyway considering how fucked up American healthcare system is ... No amount of minimum wage hikes can help if you have an urgent medical bill due in USD and not insurance to help out . So while I would n't recommend it and are generally opposed to the idea of minimum wage at all ( in theory ) I do recognize that in America the minimum wage is long overdue looking from the mainstream perspective ( trying to keep the minimum wage level with a basket of basic goods etc ) so increasing it will not create a massive disaster as it 's commonly presented in the media . However - and that is something that I want to stress here - raising the minimum wage wo n't solve even a fraction of the issues that many low - earners have today in America . It 's just a populist approach to solving economic issues ' gib mor moni ! ' Unfortunately there are many issues both economic and social which ca n't be solved by throwing money at it . It will just provide a temporary and partial relief after which the problems will come back with vengeance . The US needs systemic change ... not a minimum wage hike . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ TL;DR : Because of how the US labour market is structured and regulated a * * moderate * * minimum wage hike ( 30%)- preferably on * * state level * * - and introduced in a gradual manner * * would not result in a significant cost increase * * . It might be used as * * an excuse to raise prices depending on local conditions * * . It would however cause a lof ot mess as the businesses which got accustomed to quasi - exploitative business model and inefficient management of low - skill employees would trip over themselves trying to reconcile new reality with corporate demands or generally get in trouble with their traditional poor management . * * Employees with lowest productivity would lose jobs * * . There would be changes to the market as * * big chains would be better suited for competition than small businesses * * . The average customer however would in most instances barely feel it in terms of some significant pocket drain . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ EDIT1 & 2 : I edited it a bit .

"If our skin is constantly ridding itself of dead cells and regenerating , why and how do freckles and other ' imperfections ' remain ? Title . Please explain like I'm five.","Freckles and other skin imperfections, like moles and scars, can remain because they are caused by changes in the skin cells or the skin's structure. 
When skin cells grow and divide, they sometimes produce too much pigment, which can cause freckles. Freckles are usually small, flat, round spots on the skin that are a little darker in color than the surrounding skin. They are more common in people with lighter skin and tend to appear on areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun, like the face, arms, and legs. 
Moles are also caused by pigment-producing cells in the skin. They are usually small, round or oval-shaped spots on the skin that can be a little darker or lighter than the surrounding skin. Moles can appear anywhere on the body and can be a variety of colors, including pink, red, brown, or black. 
Scars are areas of skin that have been damaged and have healed over. They can be caused by injuries, surgeries, or certain skin conditions. Scars are usually flat and smoother than the surrounding skin and can be a different color or texture than the surrounding skin. 
While the skin is constantly shedding dead cells and regenerating new ones, these skin imperfections can remain because they are caused by changes in the skin cells or the skin's structure, which are not necessarily affected by the normal process of cell turnover.","think of it this way ... you have a stack of notebook papers .. you take a knife and stab it through . the top layer over time wears out and the next one under is new , but the knife is still there . kthx"

( Serious ) Why do men typically feel tired or exhausted after ejaculating ? ( maybe NSFW ) Girls always complain about guys falling asleep after sex ... or any climax he experiences for that matter ... Why * do * men do that ? Explain like I'm five.,"It's normal for men to feel tired or even fall asleep after ejaculating because ejaculation is a physically and emotionally intense experience. When a man ejaculates, his body releases a number of hormones and chemicals, including testosterone, oxytocin, and prolactin. These hormones can affect the body in different ways, including causing feelings of relaxation and tiredness. Additionally, the physical exertion of sexual activity can also contribute to feelings of fatigue.

It's important to note that every person is different, and not all men experience the same feelings or reactions after ejaculating. Some men may feel more energized after ejaculating, while others may feel tired or even experience a temporary decline in energy. It's also worth noting that there may be other factors that can contribute to feelings of tiredness or fatigue after ejaculating, such as stress, poor sleep, or underlying health conditions.",I sure hope I do n't have to explain this to any 5 year olds :)
Why does the US continue to poor money into the military when war has changed ? All this money and a few WoMD will wipe everything out . Explain like I'm five. ,"The United States invests in its military for a number of reasons. One reason is to protect the country and its citizens from harm.

Additionally, the military plays a role in providing humanitarian assistance, such as during natural disasters, and in maintaining critical infrastructure, such as ports and airfields.

Why legal language is so convoluted and ( seemingly ) deliberately confusing and ambiguous Surely you should be clear and concise with any communication especially with something as important as the law . Explain like I'm five.,"Legal language can seem convoluted and confusing because it is often written to be very precise and to cover a wide range of possible situations. This means that it can include many details and qualifications that might not be necessary in other types of writing. In addition, legal language often includes terms and phrases that are specific to the legal field and may not be familiar to people who are not lawyers.

One reason that legal language is written this way is to make sure that the laws and contracts that use it are clear and accurate. It is important that the law is able to cover all potential situations and that it is applied consistently. Using precise language helps to ensure that the law is interpreted correctly and applied fairly.

Another reason for the complexity of legal language is that it is often written by lawyers for other lawyers. Lawyers are trained to write in a way that is precise and detailed, and they use legal language to communicate with each other and with their clients. This means that legal documents may be written in a way that is more technical and difficult for non-lawyers to understand.

Overall, the goal of legal language is to be as clear and accurate as possible, even if that means using words and phrases that might not be familiar to everyone.","It 's easy to be "" clear "" in everday language , because so much of our communication is * implied * . For example : if you say to your girlfriend / boyfriend "" I 'll take you to lunch on Saturday "" , it assumes that you 'll * still be together * on Saturday . If you found out they were cheating on you , you 'd probably dump them and refuse to see them again . But when you have a contract with somebody , you do n't have the luxury of being ' implicit ' . If you break - up , your ex - partner can still demand that you take them out for lunch , because that 's the commitment you made . In other words : if you do n't say something * exactly * the way you mean it , you create a loophole , and someone could exploit you for it . There are many cases of this happening over really trivial things ( even where you place a comman in a sentence can change the meaning ) . And so , regrettably , it means people have learned to cover their ass by filling contracts with as much technical information as possible . Yes , it 's convoluted , but it 's to protect against the 1 % of people who will try to sue for * anything * ."
"Q. I had two menstrual cycles in one month. Is it something serious?Hello doctor,I had two menstrual cycles in one month, two weeks apart. I have not had an intercourse for two months. Should I be concerned?","It is not uncommon for women to have irregular menstrual cycles, and having two periods in one month can be a normal occurrence in some cases. However, it is important to pay attention to any changes in your menstrual cycle and to speak with a healthcare provider if you have any concerns.

There are many potential causes of irregular menstrual cycles, including stress, weight changes, certain medications, and underlying health conditions. In some cases, irregular periods may be a sign of a hormonal imbalance or other underlying health issue that may need to be addressed.

If you have not had sexual intercourse for the past two months, it is unlikely that pregnancy is the cause of your irregular menstrual cycles. However, it is still a good idea to speak with a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and to rule out any other potential causes. They will be able to perform an examination, review your medical history, and possibly order tests to determine the cause of your irregular periods. They can then provide you with appropriate treatment or recommendations as needed.",Hello.

"Do the ' extra blades ' on razors actually do anything , or is it just more marketing wank ? Surely dragging one super - sharp blade across my skin as closely as possible would do the same thing as dragging seventeen .

Having more blades can help to lift and cut hairs more effectively, but if the blades are not sharp or the design of the razor is not good, then adding more blades might not make much of a difference. Think of it like cutting a piece of paper with scissors. If you have one blade that is really sharp, it can easily cut through the paper in one smooth motion.

However, they differ in how they respond to this lack of meaning.Absurdism is the idea that the search for meaning in life is inherently flawed or impossible because the universe is inherently meaningless. However, this does not mean that an individual cannot find meaning in their own life. In fact, absurdists often believe that individuals have the freedom to create their own meaning and purpose in life, despite the universe's inherent lack of meaning.Nihilism, on the other hand, is the belief that life is meaningless and that there is no purpose or value in anything. Nihilists believe that life has no inherent meaning and that any meaning or purpose that individuals may try to find or create is ultimately futile.So, while both absurdism and nihilism recognize that life may lack inherent meaning, absurdism allows for the possibility of individuals creating their own meaning, while nihilism rejects the idea of any meaning at all.","Absurdism does n't say there is no meaning , it just points out the futility of looking for it .

Gandhi is remembered for his philosophy of nonviolence and his role in leading India to independence from British rule.",He was assassinated on 30 January 1948 by Nathuram Godse who thought Gandhi was too sympathetic to India's Muslims.
Calculus Derivatives I 'd like to know as much as possible about derivatives ; from how they are solved to what are their applications . Thx in advance . Explain like I'm five.,"Sure! Derivatives are a way to measure how much a function is changing at a certain point. They can be thought of as a slope of a function, similar to how a slope of a hill tells you how steep the hill is. To find the derivative of a function, we use a special notation called ""d/dx,"" which stands for ""the change in y (the output of the function) divided by the change in x (the input to the function)."" For example, if we have the function y = x^2, we can find the derivative by using the notation like this: dy/dx = 2x, This tells us that, for every small change in x, the output of the function (y) will change by 2 times the size of that change in x. Derivatives have many important applications. For example, they can be used to optimize things (such as finding the maximum profit for a company), to understand how systems change over time (such as population growth or the spreading of a disease), and to model physical phenomena (such as the motion of a falling object). I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","If you actually want to know * as much as possible * about derivatives , you 're in the wrong place . But I 'll explain the concept LY5 . ( and let someone else do the math part if they want . ) A derivative tells you how fast something is changing . It 's a number telling you a * rate of change * . Let 's say we 're driving down the road in a car . At 5 o'clock we are at mile marker 10 , and at 5:01 we are at mile marker 11 . Our position on the road was 10 at time 5:00 , and it was 11 at time 5:01 . So how much did our position change ? It changed by one mile in one minute . So , we were moving at 60 miles per hour . That 's why we say that velocity ( or speed in a car ) is the * derivative * of position . If you took a graph with position on the y - axis and velocity on the x - axis , you would see that , at time 5:00 , we were at position 10 , and at time 5:01 ( one unit to the right ) , we were at position 11 ( one unit upward ) . So if we drew a line from the first point to the second , it would look like this : 12 | | | 11 | o | / | / | / 10 | o ------------------------- 5:00 5:01 5:02 ... This line tells us our * * position * * over time . At 5:00 , we were at marker 10 ; at 5:01 , we were at marker 11 , and so on . And so , we can ask , what 's the * slope * of that line ? It goes up by one unit and over by one unit . So for every one ( mile ) it goes up , it goes one ( minute ) to the right . So the slope is * * 1 mile / minute * * , which is the derivative of our position . Here 's some extra food for thought : When you step on the gas pedal of your car , the car speeds up , right ? So say you 're going 60 mph when you hit the gas , hard , and in two seconds , you 've gone up to 70 mph . So in those two seconds , your * velocity * has changed by 10 miles per hour . So what is the rate of change of your velocity ? It changed by 5 miles per hour each second . ( It did this for the two seconds you hit the gas , making a total change of 10 miles per hour -- from 60 up to 70 . ) So your * acceleration * -- the derivative of velocity -- was : ( 5 miles per hour ) per second . Just like velocity is the derivative of position , acceleration is the derivative of velocity ."
Rodney King and L.A. Riots Note : I 'm not a US citizen and have actually never heard anything about these events before . Explain like I'm five.,"Sure! The Rodney King incident and the L.A. Riots are important events that happened in the United States in the early 1990s. Rodney King was a Black man who was stopped by the police in Los Angeles, California in 1991. The police officers who stopped him used a lot of force and beat him severely, even though he was not resisting arrest. A witness recorded the incident on video, and the video was shown on TV. Many people were shocked and outraged by what they saw, and they felt that the police officers had acted unfairly and had used excessive force against Rodney King. The L.A. Riots were a series of violent protests that happened in Los Angeles a year later, in 1992. The riots began after four police officers who were involved in the Rodney King incident were acquitted (found not guilty) of any wrongdoing. This decision made many people, especially people in the Black community, very angry and upset. They felt that the officers had gotten away with a crime, and they took to the streets to protest. The riots lasted for several days and resulted in a lot of damage to property and several deaths. Overall, the Rodney King incident and the L.A. Riots were significant because they brought attention to issues of police brutality and racial injustice in the United States. They also highlighted the need for reforms in the criminal justice system to address these issues.",TL;DR : All of them could not just get along .
Why are bedbugs so hard to get rid of / eradicate ? Seems like they cause people immense amounts of practical annoyance and emotional pain Explain like I'm five. ,"Bedbugs are hard to get rid of because they are very good at hiding. They can live in tiny cracks in walls and furniture, and they only come out at night to feed on people's blood. This makes them hard to find and kill. They are also very small, so it's easy for them to go unnoticed until there are a lot of them. Finally, they can go a long time without eating, so even if you do manage to kill some of them, there may still be more hiding that you don't know about.","Bed bugs are a variety and strain of insect that are extremely resistant to most pesticides , and the ones they are susceptible too are either banned or you do n't want them in your house cause they 'll kill your dog too . The only true way to fight and win against bedbugs is to elimnate them with extreme predjudice , because they are just as tenacious about coming back from the dead . They reproduce faster than most insects , having an adult grow within 3 weeks of hatching to be able to reproduce , and they reproduce in the THOUSANDS per day . The only way to non chemically kill them is with a full blast of heat . Baking them at over 140degrees and burning them out . Most pest control companies use a combination of toxic chemicals , Heat , and dry powder that eliminate the hard to reach ones , like in between unmovable couch cushions and such ."

Why did I have to throw away the lid from my water bottle going into a stadium in Hamburg ? I could keep the water and bottle but for security reasons I had to throw away the lid and have no idea why . Please explain like I'm five.,"It is likely that the security personnel at the stadium wanted to ensure that no one brought any items that could potentially be used as weapons into the stadium. The lid of a water bottle could potentially be used as a projectile, so it was not allowed inside.

"If we know the algorithm behind a hash algorithm , how is it not cracked ? For example , we know the algorithm behind SHA-1 , so how is it that we can not decrypt anything that is encrypted with SHA-1 ? Please explain like I'm five.","A hash algorithm is a mathematical function that takes an input (called a ""message"") and produces a fixed-size output (called a ""hash value"" or ""digest""). The algorithm is designed to be one-way, meaning that it is very easy to compute the hash value for a given message, but it is very difficult to reconstruct the original message from the hash value.This makes hash algorithms useful for a variety of purposes, such as verifying the integrity of a message (by computing the hash value and comparing it to a known good value), or creating a unique representation of a message (by using the hash value as a ""fingerprint"" for the message).So, even if you know the algorithm that is used to create a hash value, it is still very difficult to reverse the process and figure out the original message. This is because there are typically many different possible messages that could produce the same hash value, and there is no efficient way to search through all of these possibilities to find the original message.In summary, a hash algorithm is like a lock that can be easily opened with the right key (the message), but is very difficult to pick without the key. Just knowing the algorithm is like knowing the shape of the lock, but it doesn't tell you how to open it without the key.","So there 's two questions here : encryption and hashes . I 'll explain them both . If I tell you that a number divided by 12 has a remainder of 7 , you ca n't know for sure that the original number was 31 even though you know exactly what I did to get the answer . That 's because modulo ( getting the remainder of a division problem ) is a one - way function : there 's no way to get the original from the result . Hashes are all one - way functions . But unlike modulo division , the formula is so complex that we do n't know a way to find answers other than guess - and - check , and instead of twelve possible answers , there are something like 13407807929942597099574024998205846127479365820592393377723561443721764030073546976801874298166903427690031858186486050853753882811946569946433649006084096 possible answers , so checking different things to see if they give you the right hash is not feasible unless you have a few centuries . If someone does find a faster way to find solutions for a hash , we consider the hash "" broken "" and we switch to using a different algorithm- this happened to MD5 , for example . In the case of actual encryption , which is designed to be decrypted at some point , there 's a missing secret number from the formula that you need to do the decryption ."
Why do sockets have different designs internationally ? A question that came up from this post . URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.,"Sockets, or electrical outlets, are designed differently in different countries because the plugs that go into them are also designed differently. Different countries have different standards for the shape and size of plugs, and so the sockets have to be designed to match those standards. For example, in the United States, we have outlets that have two flat prongs, while in many other countries, the outlets have round or square prongs. The outlets are made to match the plugs that are used in that country, so that people can easily plug in their appliances and devices.","When electricity was first getting going , different companies an different countries all did different things - none is empirically better , they all work , but they look different . Once that gets started , its very hard to standardize , because you would need an adapter for , or to replace completely , every electrical device you own . And to replace all the old - style sockets in all the older houses ... All of which is an expensive pain . So the different systems persist ."

"Why does it feel SO good to rub your eyes when you 're tired ? When I start rubbing my eyes it feels so good , especially when I 'm tired . Why ? Explain like I'm five.","Rubbing your eyes can feel good because it can help to stimulate the nerves in your eyes and face, which can help to relax your muscles and make you feel more comfortable. When you are tired, your eyes and face muscles may feel strained or tense, so rubbing them can help to alleviate that tension and make you feel more relaxed. Additionally, the act of rubbing your eyes can also help to increase blood flow to the area, which can help to refresh your eyes and make you feel more alert. So, in short, rubbing your eyes can feel good because it can help to relax your muscles and increase blood flow to your eyes, which can make you feel more comfortable and alert.","When you rub your eyes it reduces the pulse rate around the rectus muscles that move the eyeball .

Including the region where you live in your investment portfolio?,"It is generally a good idea to diversify your investment portfolio by including a mix of assets from different regions. This can help to spread risk and potentially increase the overall returns of your portfolio. However, it is important to carefully consider the specific investments that you make and to be aware of the risks involved.When choosing investments, it is important to consider factors such as the economic and political stability of the region, the strength of the currency, and the growth potential of the local market. It can also be useful to consider the specific industries or sectors that are prevalent in the region and how they may be impacted by global economic trends.It is worth noting that investing in your own region may come with additional risks and considerations. For example, local events or economic conditions may have a disproportionate impact on the performance of your investments. It is generally a good idea to seek the advice of a financial advisor or professional before making any investment decisions.","Diversification is just one aspect in an investment portfolio. The other aspects in Investment are Risk Taking Ability, Liquidity, Local Regulations, Tax benefits, Ease & Convenience, Cost of carrying out transactions etc. Investing in other regions is prone FX risk and other risks depending on the region of investment.

Why do they make you remove your laptop from the case or carrying bag when going though the security check - in ? And by they I mean TSA - at an Airport . Please explain like I'm five.,"The reason that airport security personnel ask you to remove your laptop from its case or carrying bag is to allow them to screen the device more thoroughly. When your laptop is in a case or carrying bag, it is more difficult for security personnel to see what is inside and ensure that it is safe to bring onto the plane. By removing the laptop from its case or carrying bag, security personnel can more easily examine it for any prohibited items that may be hidden inside. This helps to ensure the safety of everyone on the plane and to prevent dangerous or prohibited items from being brought onto the aircraft.","So they can get a clean scan of the laptop , so they can make sure you are n't concealing anything in a fake shell .

"- How do video game save files work ? How do video games track which actions have been done , inventory , etc in a save file ? Explain like I'm five.","Video game save files work by storing information about the game's progress on your computer or console. This information can include which actions have been taken, what items are in the player's inventory, and other details about the game.

To track these things, the game uses a special kind of computer code called a ""programming language."" When you play the game, the game's software runs on your computer or console and keeps track of all the actions you take and the items you collect. When you save your game, the software writes all of this information down in a special file called a ""save file.""

The save file is like a snapshot of your game at a particular moment. It stores all of the information about what you have done so far and where you are in the game. When you load the save file, the game's software reads the information from the save file and uses it to restore the game to the exact same state it was in when you saved it.

So, when you play a video game, the save file helps the game remember all of the things you have done and where you are in the game, even if you turn off your computer or console or close the game.","[ here is an example of the gen iv pokemon save data structure ] ( URL_0 ) it 's a bit beyond the scope of this subreddit but I 'll break down the idea .

Is there any reason not to buy points when re-financing with intent not to sell for a while?,"There are a few potential reasons why you might not want to buy points when refinancing your mortgage.First, buying points can increase the upfront cost of your loan. Each point you buy typically costs 1% of the total loan amount, so if you are borrowing $200,000 and you buy two points, the cost of the points would be $4,000. This cost will be added to your loan balance and will increase the amount you have to pay back.Second, buying points can potentially lower your monthly mortgage payments, but it may take a while to recoup the cost of the points through those lower payments. For example, if the cost of the points is $4,000 and it lowers your monthly payment by $100, it would take 40 months (more than 3 years) to break even on the cost of the points. If you do not plan to stay in your home for a long time, you may not have enough time to recoup the cost of the points before you sell.Finally, buying points is not right for everyone. It depends on your financial situation and how long you plan to stay in your home. If you have a high credit score and a strong financial situation, you may be able to qualify for a low interest rate without buying points. In this case, it may not make financial sense to pay for points.It is important to carefully consider all of these factors before deciding whether or not to buy points when refinancing your mortgage. It may be helpful to speak with a financial advisor or mortgage professional to determine what is best for your specific situation.","There is the opportunity cost.  Let's say it cost you $1000 to buy 0.25% discount. Over N number of years that saves you let's say $2000 thus your profit is $1000. What if you took that $1000 and invested it? Would you have more than $2000 after N number of  years? Obviously answering this question is not easy but you can make some educated guesses. For example, you can compare the return you'll likely get from investing in CD or treasury bond. A bit more risky is to invest in the stock market but an index fund should be fairly safe and you can easily find the average return over 5 - 10 year period.  For example, if your loan is $200,000 at 0.25% per year you'll get $500 in savings. Over 10 years that's $5000 - $1000 to buy the point, you end up with $4000.  Using the calculator on this site, I calculated that if you invested in the Dow Jones industrial average between 2007 and 2017  you total return would have been 111% (assuming dividends are reinvested) or you would've had a total of $2110.  I'm not sure how accurate those numbers are but it seems likely that buying points is a pretty good investment if you stay in the house for 10 years or more."
"Please explain what is ""Corpus linguistics""","Corpus linguistics is a field of study that involves the analysis of large collections of naturally occurring language data, known as corpora, in order to understand the patterns and regularities of language use. Corpora can be compiled from a variety of sources, including written texts, transcripts of spoken language, or even social media posts.



Corpus linguistics involves the use of computational tools and methods to analyze and interpret the data contained in corpora, with the goal of understanding how language is used in real-world contexts and how it changes over time. This field has a wide range of applications, including language teaching, translation, natural language processing, and linguistic research.



Some of the key techniques used in corpus linguistics include word frequency analysis, concordancing (i.e., searching for specific words or phrases within a corpus), and statistical analysis of linguistic patterns. Corpus linguistics can provide insights into issues such as language variation, language change, and language use in different contexts, and can be used to inform the development of language-related technologies such as spell checkers and machine translation systems.","Corpus linguistics is the study of a language as that language is expressed in its text corpus (plural corpora), its body of ""real world"" text. Corpus linguistics proposes that a reliable analysis of a language is more feasible with corpora collected in the field—the natural context (""realia"") of that language—with minimal experimental interference.
The text-corpus method uses the body of texts written in any natural language to derive the set of abstract rules which govern that language. Those results can be used to explore the relationships between that subject language and other languages which have undergone a similar analysis. The first such corpora were manually derived from source texts, but now that work is automated.
Corpora have not only been used for linguistics research, they have also been used to compile dictionaries (starting with The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language in 1969) and grammar guides, such as A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language, published in 1985.
Experts in the field have differing views about the annotation of a corpus. These views range from John McHardy Sinclair, who advocates minimal annotation so texts speak for themselves, to the Survey of English Usage team (University College, London), who advocate annotation as allowing greater linguistic understanding through rigorous recording."
"Please explain what is ""Online algorithm""","An online algorithm is an algorithm that processes input data one element at a time, and produces output after each input element has been processed. In contrast, an offline algorithm processes the entire input data set in advance, and then produces the output.



Online algorithms are particularly useful in situations where the input data is too large to be stored in memory all at once, or where the input data is generated dynamically as the algorithm is running. For example, an online algorithm might be used to process a stream of data from a sensor, or to process user input in a web application.



Online algorithms often have to make trade-offs between the speed at which they process the input data and the quality of the output they produce. In many cases, the output produced by an online algorithm may not be as accurate as the output produced by an offline algorithm, but the ability to process the input data in a streaming fashion can be more important in certain scenarios.



There are many different types of online algorithms, including sorting algorithms, clustering algorithms, and machine learning algorithms. They are used in a wide variety of applications, including data processing, data analysis, and data mining.","In computer science, an online algorithm is one that can process its input piece-by-piece in a serial fashion, i.e., in the order that the input is fed to the algorithm, without having the entire input available from the start.
In contrast, an offline algorithm is given the whole problem data from the beginning and is required to output an answer which solves the problem at hand. In operations research, the area in which online algorithms are developed is called online optimization.
As an example, consider the sorting algorithms selection sort and insertion sort: selection sort repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted remainder and places it at the front, which requires access to the entire input; it is thus an offline algorithm. On the other hand, insertion sort considers one input element per iteration and produces a partial solution without considering future elements. Thus insertion sort is an online algorithm.
Note that the final result of an insertion sort is optimum, i.e., a correctly sorted list. For many problems, online algorithms cannot match the performance of offline algorithms. If the ratio between the performance of an online algorithm and an optimal offline algorithm is bounded, the online algorithm is called competitive.
Not every offline algorithm has an efficient online counterpart."

"All publicity is good publicity . Like , even really terrible ones ? Please explain like I'm five.","No, not all publicity is good publicity. The saying ""all publicity is good publicity"" means that even if people are talking about something in a negative way, it can still be helpful because it gets people's attention and helps them remember the thing. For example, let's say a company releases a new product, and it is really bad. If a lot of people write reviews or talk about how bad the product is, it can still be helpful for the company because it gets people talking about the product and helps them remember it. However, this does not mean that it is always a good thing to have negative publicity. If a company has a lot of negative publicity, it can damage their reputation and make people less likely to trust them or want to do business with them. It is usually better to have positive publicity, where people are talking about the good things about a product or company, rather than negative publicity.","The goal of advertising is to make people aware you exist . People ca n't buy your products / services of they do n't know you exist .

Why are GPUs utilized for number - crunching work ? What makes a rig with many graphics cards better than a rig with many processors ? Explain like I'm five.,"GPUs, or graphics processing units, are specialized hardware that can perform many calculations very quickly. They are particularly good at handling tasks that involve processing large amounts of data, such as rendering graphics, running simulations, and training machine learning models.

A rig with many graphics cards is better than a rig with many processors for certain types of work because GPUs are designed to be much faster at performing certain types of calculations. For example, a GPU can perform many mathematical operations at the same time, which allows it to work through large amounts of data very quickly. In contrast, a traditional processor, or CPU, can only perform a limited number of calculations at once, so it is not as efficient at handling large amounts of data.

So, if you have a task that requires a lot of number-crunching, such as rendering a 3D animation or training a machine learning model, a rig with many graphics cards will be much faster than a rig with many processors.","GPUs are more powerful than CPUs . The difference is that a CPU is better at more things .

Are bond ETF capital gains taxed similar to stock or stock funds if held for more than 1 year?,"Bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are taxed similarly to other bond investments when it comes to capital gains. If you hold a bond ETF for more than one year and then sell it for a profit, that profit is considered a long-term capital gain and is generally taxed at a lower rate than short-term capital gains.The specific tax rate that applies to your long-term capital gains from a bond ETF will depend on your tax bracket. For most taxpayers, the long-term capital gains tax rate is 0%, 15%, or 20%. However, if you are in a higher tax bracket, your long-term capital gains rate may be higher.It's worth noting that bond ETFs may also generate income from the bonds they hold, such as interest payments or bond redemptions. This income is generally subject to federal income tax, although the specific tax rate will depend on the type of bond and your tax bracket.If you hold a bond ETF in a tax-deferred account, such as an IRA or 401(k), you will not have to pay taxes on your capital gains or income until you withdraw the funds from the account.It's always a good idea to consult with a financial professional or tax advisor to get a better understanding of how your bond ETF investments may be taxed.","Yes, that's correct."
"Why do cats do that thing where they cry to leave or come into the house , but once you open the door they change their mind ? Is there any scientific explanation that suggests why they may do that or are they just assholes ? Please explain like I'm five.","Cats can be very unpredictable at times, and it's not always easy to understand what they are trying to communicate. It's possible that your cat is trying to tell you something specific when they cry at the door, but it's also possible that they are simply expressing their desire to go outside or come inside, and they change their mind once the door is opened because they become distracted by something else.One thing that might be happening is that your cat is responding to stimuli in their environment. For example, if they see a bird or another animal outside, they may want to go outside to explore or hunt. If they see something interesting inside, they may want to come inside to investigate.Another possibility is that your cat is simply trying to get your attention. Cats are social animals, and they often rely on their humans for affection and interaction. By crying at the door, your cat may be trying to get you to interact with them and provide them with some attention.It's also possible that your cat is experiencing some anxiety or stress, and crying at the door is a way for them to cope with this. Cats can become anxious for a variety of reasons, such as changes in their routine or environment, or conflicts with other pets. If you think your cat might be experiencing anxiety, it might be helpful to talk to your veterinarian or a feline behaviorist for advice on how to help your cat feel more comfortable and secure.",Maybe they just want some attention . They noticed that if they vocalize in certain spots someone will come soon .
"Why is Facebook on the decline ? it is still the social media king where everyone posts their pics , statuses , etc etc . what other social media sites are attracting away users from facebook , and why ? Explain like I'm five.","Facebook is still a very popular social media platform, but it has faced some challenges in recent years. One reason is that some people are concerned about the company's data privacy practices and how it uses the personal information that people share on the platform. This has caused some people to become more cautious about what they share on Facebook or to stop using the platform altogether.

Another reason is that some people have become tired of the constant stream of posts, ads, and notifications on Facebook, and have begun to use other social media platforms that they perceive as being less cluttered or more focused on specific interests. For example, platforms like Instagram and TikTok have become very popular in recent years, particularly among younger users, because they allow people to share photos and videos in a more visual and creative way.

In addition, some people have become more interested in using social media platforms that are focused on specific interests or communities, such as forums or discussion groups, rather than platforms that are more general in nature. These platforms can be a good way for people to connect with others who have similar interests or to learn about new topics.

Overall, there are many reasons why people might choose to use different social media platforms, and each person's reasons may be different. However, it's important to remember that no one platform is right for everyone, and it's okay to try out different platforms to see which ones work best for you.","Facebook used to be the one stop shop for social media . You posted your status , pictures , and videos on Facebook . But then the market for social media has been subdivided . Twitter came along and it was better for posting stupid statuses that no one cares about so less statuses got posted . Then Instagram came along and told you THIS is how you should share your pictures with your friends . Now Vine is getting bigger . The stupid little videos that would have been posted on Facebook are now on Vine . At this point I mainly use Facebook for the group aspect now ."
"What is the appeal of the film "" American Psycho ? "" Is it supposed to be a serious film , but can be taken as a comedy ? I feel like it went over my head . Please explain like I'm five.","""American Psycho"" is a dark comedy film about a wealthy, young Wall Street investment banker named Patrick Bateman who is secretly a serial killer. The film is based on a novel of the same name by Bret Easton Ellis. The appeal of the film is that it is a satirical commentary on the excesses and superficiality of 1980s culture, particularly the materialism and greed of the Wall Street world. It is supposed to be a serious film, but it is also meant to be humorous in its portrayal of Bateman's psychosis and the absurdity of his actions. Some viewers may find the film's violence and dark humor disturbing, while others may find it amusing.","It 's a critique ( satire if you like ) of yuppie culture , which encourages and rewards sociopathy . Every character in the movie is purely self - interested , caring only about their social status , because that 's the only way to get ahead in New York yuppie culture . This results in every one of them being interchangeable and bland . Their collective sociopathy is what allows Bateman , a true sociopath , to get away with a dozen or so murders . I would n't say that it being serious or comedy is mutually exclusive , but if you like , it 's often called a dark comedy ."
where does a flea live,"Fleas are small, wingless insects that are known for their ability to jump long distances. They are parasites that feed on the blood of mammals, including humans, dogs, cats, and other animals. Fleas typically live in areas where their hosts are present, such as in the fur of a cat or dog, or in the bedding or carpets in a home. They can also be found in outdoor areas where their host animals spend time, such as in grass, bushes, or trees. Fleas are attracted to warmth, moisture, and carbon dioxide, which helps them locate their hosts. They can survive for several months without a host, but they need a blood meal to reproduce.","Fleas are external parasites , living by hematophagy off the blood of mammals and birds ."
How do people get addicted to cigarettes if the first smokes are n't addictive ? Do you have to try hard to pick up such a brutally unhealthy habit ? Explain like I'm five.,"Cigarette smoking is not immediately addictive for everyone, but for many people, it can become addictive over time. This is because cigarettes contain a drug called nicotine, which is highly addictive. When a person smokes a cigarette, the nicotine is quickly absorbed into their bloodstream and travels to the brain, where it can cause changes in the brain's chemistry that make the person feel good. At first, smoking may not seem addictive because the effects of nicotine are relatively mild. However, as a person continues to smoke, their body becomes used to the nicotine and may start to crave it when it's not there. This is what can lead to addiction. It's important to note that smoking is a very unhealthy habit and can cause serious health problems, including lung cancer, heart disease, and many other diseases. It's not easy to pick up this habit, and it's best to avoid it altogether if possible.","For me , smoking started as casual activity while drinking at parties and around friends . Eventually , the desire was daily . Smoked for many years . Quit about 7 years ago ."
"Why are policies such as making it illegal to use welfare funds on strip clubs , alcohol , etc . considered "" poor shaming "" ? I 've seen some of these arguments before , but never seen any of them substantiated with data or figures . Explain like I'm five.","There are a few reasons why some people might say that policies that restrict how welfare funds can be used are ""poor shaming.""

First, these policies suggest that people who receive welfare benefits (which are often given to people who are struggling financially) are not responsible or trustworthy enough to make their own decisions about how to spend their money. This can make people who receive welfare feel like they are being judged or looked down upon by others.

Second, these policies might not actually do much to solve the problems they are intended to address. For example, making it illegal to use welfare funds at strip clubs or to buy alcohol might not stop people from going to strip clubs or drinking alcohol if they really want to. Instead, it might just make it harder for them to buy food or other things they need.

Finally, some people argue that these policies unfairly single out poor people, since people who are not on welfare are free to spend their money however they like. This can create a feeling of unfairness and might make it seem like the government is treating poor people unfairly.

Overall, the main argument against ""poor shaming"" policies is that they can make people who are already struggling feel even worse about themselves and might not actually help solve the problems they are intended to address.","Anytime you provide assistance and restrict what they can buy , whatever it is , is a judgement . On top of that this is a straw man issue since it does n't even happen . No one gets strippers with assistance money but it makes for a great sound byte on Fox news"
Can a finger injury cause infection?I cut myself with a box cutter at work while cutting boxes on the side of my finger. Its been a few days and my middle finger is soar and has a wart where the cut is. It looks as if there is puss but when I try squeezing it there is none. Now my whole body is soar for no apparent reason. Could it be infected?,"Yes, a finger injury can cause an infection if it is not properly treated. If you have a cut on your finger that is sore and has a wart-like growth, it is possible that you have an infection. If the wound is not properly cleaned and covered, bacteria can enter the wound and cause an infection. If you have a fever or other symptoms such as chills, fatigue, or muscle aches in addition to the sore finger, it is possible that you have a more serious infection and should seek medical attention. If you are experiencing these symptoms, it is important to see a healthcare provider as soon as possible. They will be able to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.","Welcome at HCM    I have gone through your query and being your physician I completely understand your health  concerns.  keep the affected area clean and away from any contamination. yes, there are chances for it to get infected.    meet your doctor so that you can be proeprly assessed.

What does the game engine do for a programmer and why do I care unreal vs Unity etc ... Please explain like I'm five.,"A game engine is a piece of software that helps a programmer create a video game. It provides a set of tools and features that make it easier to create a game, such as a way to draw graphics on the screen, play sound effects, and handle user input.Different game engines have different features and capabilities. For example, Unreal Engine is a popular game engine that is used to create high-quality games with advanced graphics. Unity is another popular game engine that is good for creating both 2D and 3D games, and is easier to learn than Unreal Engine.As a programmer, you might care about which game engine you use because it can affect how much work you have to do to create your game, and how good your game looks and plays. Different game engines are better suited for different types of games, so you'll want to choose the one that is the best fit for your project.","First , it provides an existing toolchain for the developers . Much of developing a game is not just the actual player application that the end user sees , but the collection of support tools used during development . This is fully - featured software in its own right , and you can either write it yourself or buy it premade in a game engine . Second , it provides a standardization across platforms . Many game engines support PC , Mac , Linux , Android , iOS targets . Which basically means you just create the graphics and the music , and the game engine can run on all of those platforms automatically . Why would a player care ? Mostly just branding , unless you always have buggy problems from a particular engine on your system ."
"What makes CRISPR a * synthetic * biology innovation ? I 'm hoping to understand the nature of synthetic biology , as a lot of the explanations I 've received assume a lot of internal knowledge . Please explain like I'm five.","CRISPR is considered a synthetic biology innovation because it allows scientists to artificially create and modify genes, which is something that does not naturally occur.To understand this a little better, let's start by talking about what genes are. Every living thing has genes, which are like instructions that tell our bodies how to grow and function. Genes are made up of DNA, which is a special code that is found in all living things.CRISPR is a tool that scientists can use to make changes to the DNA code in a very precise way. This is called gene editing. By using CRISPR, scientists can add, remove, or change specific parts of the DNA code to see how it affects the way the gene works.Synthetic biology is a field of science that uses tools like CRISPR to create or design new biological parts, devices, and systems that do not already exist in nature. This can include things like creating new types of bacteria or plants, or even designing entirely new organisms that have never existed before.So, CRISPR is considered a synthetic biology innovation because it allows scientists to artificially create and modify genes, which is something that is not found in nature and requires the use of advanced scientific tools and techniques.","Previously , we have believed that cellular DNA is like words chiseled into a stone tablet — what is written there is constant and unchangeable . The discovery of the CRISPR system has challenged this belief . DNA in some species now is more like an internet server . Viruses come in and try to hack the server to change its programming . The CAS protein is like a firewall that recognizes someone attempting to infiltrate the system . CRISPR is where the firewall stores its blacklisted IP addresses . CAS adds the IP address of the invading hacker into the web host to prevent the viruses from editing the server . Now that scientists know that this blacklist exists , we can add all kinds of things to the blacklist that are n’t IP addresses . We can access the part of the server that ’s meant to be changed and make the blacklist ( CRISPR region of the genome ) store our information . The full use of CRISPR has not yet been realized , but the fact that we can insert specific genes into living cells is a huge breakthrough . The synthetic part comes in with us adding that information where it does n't belong ."
1.What happens when you move a file to the recycle bin ? 2.What happens when you clear your recycle bin completely ? Where do the files go ? . Explain like I'm five.,"When you move a file to the recycle bin, the file is not actually deleted from your computer. Instead, it is moved to a special folder on your computer called the recycle bin. You can still access the file from the recycle bin and restore it to its original location if you need to. When you clear the recycle bin, the files in the recycle bin are permanently deleted from your computer. This means that the files are no longer accessible and cannot be restored. The space on your hard drive that was being used by the deleted files is then made available for new files to be saved. To explain it in a way a five year old might understand: Imagine that you have a toy box in your room. When you want to get rid of a toy, you put it in the toy box. The toy is not really gone - it's still in the toy box and you can still play with it if you want. But if you decide that you don't want the toy anymore, you can throw it away and it will be gone forever. That's kind of like what happens when you move a file to the recycle bin and then clear it. The file is like the toy in the toy box, and when you clear the recycle bin it's like throwing the toy away.","When you move a file to the Recycle bin , you 're not deleting the file , you 're removing it from the usable files . The computer still fully remembers the file , but sets it aside . When you empty the recycle bin , it still does n't delete the file . It simply "" forgets "" where the file was . This means that later on down the road , the place where the data was at will be overwritten . This is where defragmentation comes into play . When you hear that , it 's a process of reorganizing the data on your machine to have it fit properly and therefore be more easily accessed . Some programs such as CCleaner and DBAN have the ability to fully wipe drives by going through deleted files and copying "" blank data "" ( Random 1s and 0s ) over them over and over and re - wiping them , so if you tried to get access to the original files , at most you could only find the blank data ."
"Why ca n't we just cut a cancerous tumor out ? I know for some places in the body that develop tumors , we ca n't just cut them out ? Why is that ? If bleeding is an issue could n't we just cauterize it ? Please explain like I'm five.","Sure! Removing a cancerous tumor can often help improve a person's health and quality of life. However, it's not always as simple as just cutting the tumor out. Here are a few reasons why: 1. Location: Sometimes, tumors are located in areas of the body that are hard to reach or operate on, such as near important blood vessels or organs. This can make it difficult or even dangerous to remove the tumor. 2. Size: If a tumor is very large, it might be hard to remove all of it without damaging surrounding healthy tissue. 3. Spread: Cancer cells can spread, or metastasize, from the original tumor to other parts of the body. This means that even if the doctor removes the main tumor, there might still be cancer cells in other areas that need to be treated. 4. Cauterization: Cauterization is a way to stop bleeding by burning the blood vessels shut. While it can be helpful in some cases, it's not always the best option for removing a tumor because it can also damage healthy tissue. In summary, removing a cancerous tumor is not always easy because of the location, size, and spread of the tumor, and cauterization is not always the best option.","That is indeed what we try to do for many tumors . The problem is that cells can escape from that localized area and travel to other parts of the body . Once that happens , it 's extremely difficult to stop because you ca n't simply "" take it out "" any more , and those cells could end up all over the place . You then need to use other techniques like chemotherapy ."
Should I undergo a blood transfusion or take an iron pill for low ferritin level?Hi I recently been diagnosed as severely anaemic my ferritin level is at four and I was wondering what should I do them is taking iron pills enough or should I be getting a blood transfusion of some kind or shots or something?,"It is important to discuss treatment options with a healthcare provider. Severe anemia can be caused by various factors, and the appropriate treatment will depend on the underlying cause of the anemia and the severity of your symptoms.

In general, treatment for anemia may include taking iron supplements, receiving a blood transfusion, or receiving injections of iron or other medications. Your healthcare provider will consider a number of factors, including your age, overall health, and the severity of your anemia, when determining the best treatment plan for you.

If you are experiencing severe symptoms of anemia, such as difficulty breathing or chest pain, you may need to be treated in a hospital setting. In these cases, a blood transfusion may be necessary to quickly increase your hemoglobin levels.

It is important to follow your healthcare provider's recommendations and to continue with any prescribed treatment as directed. If you have any concerns about your treatment plan, it is important to discuss them with your healthcare provider.","Hello,  So if you have symptoms of anaemia like breathlessness and severe fatigue, or if you are unable to take iron tablets,  transfusion is indicated. Otherwise, you can take iron tablets. Else, you can take injectable iron also. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

What are the gains from more liquidity in ETF for small investors?,"Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment vehicles that trade on stock exchanges and offer investors exposure to a diverse range of assets, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, and more. ETFs can provide several benefits to small investors, including:Diversification: ETFs allow small investors to easily diversify their portfolio across a wide range of assets, helping to mitigate risk and potentially improve returns.Low costs: ETFs often have lower fees than mutual funds, making them more attractive to small investors who may be more sensitive to the impact of fees on their returns.Liquidity: ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, which means they can be bought and sold throughout the day. This can be beneficial for small investors who need to access their funds quickly or who may need to sell their investments in a hurry.Transparency: ETFs are required to disclose their holdings on a regular basis, which allows investors to see exactly what they are investing in. This can be helpful for small investors who want to understand the makeup of their portfolio.Overall, ETFs can provide small investors with a convenient and cost-effective way to gain exposure to a diverse range of assets, while also providing the flexibility and liquidity they may need to manage their investments.","In my opinion, if you are doing long-term investing, this is a non-issue.  The difference of hours in being able to trade an ETF during the day vs. only being able to trade a traditional mutual fund at day-end is irrelevant if you are holding the investment for a long time. If you are engaging in day trading, market timing, or other advanced/controversial trading practices, then I suppose it could make a difference. For the way I invest (index funds, long-term, set-it-and-forget-it), ETFs have no advantage over traditional mutual funds."
Suggest treatment for persistent nauseaIve had a mirena iud in place for 5 years. The doctor try to take it out but couldnt grasps the strings. I had went to the doc originally thinking i was preg.

Ultrasound on the 15 of this mth.,"I'm sorry to hear that you have been experiencing persistent nausea and difficulty with your Mirena IUD. It's important to speak with your healthcare provider about your symptoms and any concerns you have. They will be able to assess your specific situation and determine the best course of action.

In the meantime, there are a few things you can try to help manage your nausea:

Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day instead of three large meals.

Avoid foods that are spicy, fatty, or high in fiber, as these can contribute to nausea.

Drink plenty of fluids, especially water, to help prevent dehydration.

Avoid strong odors, as they can trigger nausea.

Get plenty of rest and try to relax as much as possible.

Try over-the-counter medications, such as ginger or peppermint, which may help to alleviate nausea.

It's important to follow up with your healthcare provider about your symptoms and the difficulty you had with removing the Mirena IUD. They will be able to provide you with more specific guidance and treatment options based on your individual situation.","Hallow Dear,Since the threads of Mirena are neither visible nor palpable, it is likely that it has migrated outside the uterine cavity - may be in the peritoneal cavity by perforating the uterine walls. Perforation of intrauterine device, particularly in the abdominal cavity can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, etc.. You are having these symptoms for about 2 months. Therefore it is likely that Mirena has perforated since that date.  Your doctor therefore has advised you Ultrasonography. It will locate the position of Mirena. If it has perforated the uterine wall - partially or completely, you will need surgical intervention for removing the device. Please follow your doctors religiously. You need Gynaecologist's care.

What does positive and negative mean when you are talking about blood types ? I hear people say they are positive and negative when they get their blood type taken . I have always wondered what this means . Explain like I'm five.,"When talking about blood types, positive and negative refer to the presence or absence of a certain protein on the surface of red blood cells. This protein is called the ""Rh factor."" If you have the protein, your blood is Rh positive. If you do not have the protein, your blood is Rh negative.

It is important to know your blood type because it determines whether or not you can receive certain blood transfusions. For example, if you have Rh-negative blood and you receive a transfusion of Rh-positive blood, your body may react negatively to the transfusion because it sees the Rh-positive blood as being foreign. This can cause serious problems. On the other hand, if you receive a transfusion of Rh-negative blood, your body is more likely to accept it because it does not contain the protein that it would react to.

So when someone says they are ""positive"" or ""negative,"" they are talking about whether or not they have the Rh factor protein on their red blood cells. Does that make sense?",""" + "" and "" - "" refers to the Rhesus Factor ( RhF ) . It 's just another "" identifier "" , like A / B / AB / O , but much simpler . Basically , if you 're RhF+ , you can receive + or - , because the lack of RhF does not cause an immunological reaction ; however , you can only donate to other + s. If you 're RhF- , you can only receive other -s , because blood that is RhF+ will appear foreign to your body and cause a reaction ; however , you can donate to anyone . So , O - s can donate to pretty much anyone , but are very picky about who they receive from . AB+s can only donate to other AB+s , but can receive from anyone ."
How does an index rearrange its major holdings,"An index is a financial product that tracks the performance of a group of securities. These securities can be stocks, bonds, commodities, or a combination of these asset classes. The index is designed to reflect the performance of a particular market or market segment, such as the S&P 500, which tracks the performance of 500 large-cap US stocks.An index is not a physical investment product, but rather a benchmark against which the performance of investment portfolios can be measured. Investors can buy financial products, such as index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), that track the performance of an index. These products are designed to replicate the performance of the index by holding the same securities in the same proportions as the index.Indexes are typically managed by index providers, such as Standard & Poor's or MSCI, which are responsible for selecting the securities that make up the index and for maintaining the index over time. The index provider will periodically review the securities in the index and make changes as necessary to ensure that the index continues to accurately reflect the market or market segment it is designed to track. This can include adding or removing securities, or adjusting the weightings of the securities in the index.In summary, an index provider will rearrange the major holdings of an index by adding or removing securities or adjusting the weightings of the securities in the index in order to ensure that the index accurately reflects the market or market segment it is designed to track.","S & P Index Announcements would have notes on when there are changes to the index.  For example in the S & P Small-cap 600 there is a change that takes affect on Feb. 19, 2013. As for how index funds handle changes to the fund, this depends a bit on the nature of the fund as open-end mutual funds would be different than exchange-traded funds.  The open-end fund would have to sell and purchase to keep tracking the index which can be interesting to see how well this is handled to keep the transaction costs down while the ETFs will just unload the shares in the redemption units of the stock leaving the index while taking in new shares with creation units of the newly added stock to the index."

"Why are "" classic cars "" from the 60 's and 70 's still so much more desirable to collectors than cars from the 80 's and 90 's ? In 20 years , will we expect to see people restoring and selling their Deloreans ? Please explain like I'm five.","There are a few reasons why classic cars from the 1960s and 1970s are often more desirable to collectors than cars from the 1980s and 1990s. One reason is that many classic cars from the 1960s and 1970s are considered to be more aesthetically pleasing than cars from later decades. These cars often have a timeless, retro look that is still appreciated today. Another reason is that many classic cars from the 1960s and 1970s are considered to be more well-built and of higher quality than cars from later decades. These cars were often made with more care and attention to detail, which can make them more appealing to collectors. It's also possible that some classic cars from the 1960s and 1970s are considered more valuable because they are more rare or hard to find. These cars may have been produced in smaller quantities, or may have been owned by famous people or used in movies or TV shows, which can increase their value. As for whether people will be restoring and selling Deloreans in 20 years, it's hard to say. Deloreans are certainly an interesting and memorable car, but it's difficult to predict what will be popular with collectors in the future.","Baby Boomers . Those classic cars are the ones they grew up with & wished they could own when they were young & broke . Now that they 're older & have money , they can finally buy them . Later generations really do n't have the same love affair with the automobile that the Boomers did . Part of it is based on the massive growth of suburbs & freeways , making cars an essential part of life & a symbol of freedom . You can just look at the decline of the drive - in theater to see how our love of the automobile has declined . Nothing was really the same after the oil crisis in the 70s . The massive increase in gas prices from the late 90s through the 2000s have sealed the fate of "" car culture "" - nobody really wants to just "" go for a drive "" through the country when gas is $ 4 / gallon . Younger people are moving back to cities & reevaluating the tradeoffs of suburban living - people would rather have time than space ( not to mention that , when you ca n't afford to buy , there 's few reasons to want to live in the ' burbs ) . ---- For another example of the influence Baby Boomers have had on our culture , [ look at our popular Christmas songs ] ( URL_0 ) .

So it is unlikely that people were very lazy while living in the wild.\n\nHowever, nowadays, people have many more conveniences and don't have to work as hard to survive. This means that it can be easier to feel lazy, especially if someone is comfortable and doesn't have to work very hard to get what they need.\n\nRemember, it's important to try to stay active and do the things that we need to do, even if we don't feel like it. It can help us feel good about ourselves and achieve our goals.","Basically the human body wants to survive and we have an innate desire to get that surviving done with as little energy lost as we can . The more energy we expend , the more calories we need to eat to make up for it , so saving those calories is an evolutionary advantage . Take into account as well that people hunter - gatherer settlements today tend to spend an average of 12 hours a week "" working "" , and while I 'm not expert , that could potentially have given early humans the chance to be a bit lazy . On a related note , humans actually have a lot of calorie - related wants that overcompensate on calorie consumption / storage . For example , our absolute love of sugar ( and our craving today of things so sweet a hunter - gatherer would have found nothing comparative in the wild ) and the fact that there is a delay between the time we are full and the time we stop being hungry . Some theories say that these advantages were incorporated into humans because food was very scarce back in the day , and survival - wise it 's much better to err on the side of extra calories than on the side of starvation ."
How does communism exactly work ? What are the finer details about communism ? How do people receive currency ? How is the amount of currency they receive calculated ? How does the economy work and how do citizens interact with each other ? Explain like I'm five. ,"Communism is a political and economic ideology that aims to create a classless, stateless society in which the means of production are owned and controlled by the community as a whole. Under communism, the government controls the economy and there is no private property. Instead of using money, the government provides each person with what they need, such as food, housing, and healthcare.\n\nIn a communist society, people receive what they need based on their contributions to the community. For example, a doctor might receive more resources than a teacher because the doctor's work is considered more valuable to the community.\n\nIn a communist economy, the government decides how to produce and distribute goods and services. This is different from a capitalist economy, where private businesses make these decisions based on profit.\n\nCommunism is based on the idea that everyone should contribute to the community according to their abilities and receive from the community according to their needs. The goal is to create a more equal society where everyone has access to the resources they need to live a good life.","Different kinds of communism , known as "" tendencies "" , have different views about this but most Communists follow Marx 's thoughts on "" dialectical materialism "" . That basically says that human nature is shaped by human society and so by changing society we can change human nature . And it 's not just that we can but we will , we can not not . So human nature and society is constantly changing and evolving and so the only thing we can say with confidence about future society is that it will be different to now . Communists are trying to shape this future society in the direction of communism . Communism is the idea of a moneyless , stateless , classless utopia based upon the idea of "" from each according to what they can do to each according to their need "" Some of them have attempted to answer the questions you are asking , but they are basically just guessing and you should ignore them . The real answer is that we do n't know , and we wo n't know until we get there . So we 're just going to try and shape future society in the direction of more freedom and equality and see where that gets us . Marx did make some suggestions in terms of defining principles with which to attempt to build and change a future society : - Property is theft . What this means is that no one has a moral right to the stuff that they think is theirs . If you chop a branch off a tree and use that branch to make a walking stick you might think that that is "" your "" walking stick , that you have earned . But actually you never would have been able to do so without the explorer who first scouted out the path to that tree , the blacksmith that made the axe you used to chop off the branch , the teacher who taught you how to make a walking stick , the cook that gave you the meal to give you the strength to do so , and the inventors of walking sticks , axes , paths , meals etc ... So you actually owe a debt to all these people and the walking stick is as much theirs as it is yours . And that 's a very direct example of created value . Most forms of value are even more indirect and so the amount of the value you have gained that you owe to the others who helped you get to that point is even greater . - Ownership is wage theft . Say you work in a shoe factory . You take $ 5 of material and turn them into $ 30 shoes . The owner of the shoe factory pays you $ 5 per shoe . It costs them maybe $ 5 per shoe to run the factory . The owner does nothing at all , but still makes $ 15 per shoe . But they have n't done anything for that money . That $ 15 per shoe should be yours . That is wage theft , the owner has no moral right to that money . - Rent is theft . We earn more from capital than labour . That is wrong . Thomas Picketty wrote a great book which updates this for the 21st century . Google r > g. Basically most money is n't earned by people working . It 's earned by rich people using their money to make more money without any action on their part . So say interest , shares , the value of your house going up over time , or your owning of a company which makes money : all these are examples of rent . You just sit there getting richer without doing any work . Marx says rent is theft . Picketty goes further and says the consequence of rent is that the rich will always be able to make more money without working than workers can by working , and so the gap between rich and poor is always going to grow . In addition most communists , Marx included , feel that the path to communism is socialism . Socialism is the idea that workplaces should be democratically controlled . Happy to answer any other questions you have about communism ."
"What 's the use of nipples on a man ? Does it have a purpose or not ? If yes , what is that purpose . Explain like I'm five.","Nipples are a small protrusion on the skin that are present on both males and females. In humans and some other mammals, nipples are used to feed babies with milk. In females, milk is produced in the breasts and flows through the nipples when the baby sucks on them. In males, nipples do not produce milk, but they still have a purpose.

One purpose of nipples in males is that they help to regulate body temperature. Nipples contain small muscles that can help to control the flow of blood in and around the nipples, which can help to keep the body warm or cool as needed.

Another purpose of nipples in males is that they can be a source of pleasure. Some men and women find that their nipples are sensitive to touch and can be sexually stimulating.

So in short, nipples on a man have a purpose for regulating body temperature and for providing pleasure.",They have no purpose . We develop the characteristics of women first while in the womb and what makes us male develops afterwards .
Keeping our current home (second property) as a rental. Will it interfere with purchasing a third home?,"Purchasing a third home should not necessarily interfere with keeping your current home as a rental property. However, it's important to consider a few things before making a decision about purchasing a third home.First, you should consider your financial situation and whether you have the resources to support owning and managing multiple properties. Owning a rental property can be a lucrative investment, but it also requires a significant amount of time and effort to maintain and manage the property. You'll need to consider the costs of repairs and maintenance, as well as the potential for vacancies and other financial risks. You'll also need to consider whether you have the necessary insurance coverage and whether you're prepared to handle any legal issues that may arise.Second, you should consider the local market and whether owning a third home would be a good investment. You'll want to research the local real estate market to determine whether it's a good time to buy and whether there is a demand for rental properties in the area. You'll also want to consider the location of the property and whether it's likely to appreciate in value over time.Finally, you should also consider whether owning a third home is the right decision for you and your family. Owning multiple properties can be a lot of work, and it's important to be prepared for the time and effort required to manage them effectively. If you're not sure whether you're ready for the responsibilities that come with owning multiple properties, it may be worth taking some time to consider your options before making a decision.","There's a couple issues to consider: When you sell your primary home, the IRS gives you a $500k exemption (married, filing jointly) on gain.  If you decide not to sell your current house now, and you subsequently fall outside the ownership/use tests, then you may owe taxes on any gains when you sell the house. Rather than being concerned about your net debt, you should be concerned about your monthly debt payments.  Generally speaking, you cannot have debt payments of more than 36% of your monthly income.  If you can secure a renter for your current property, then you may be able to reach this ratio for your next (third) property. Also, only 75% of your expected monthly rental income is considered for calculating your 36% number. (This is not an exhaustive list of risks you expose yourself to). The largest risk is if you or your spouse find yourself without income (e.g. lost job, accident/injury, no renter), then you may be hurting to make your monthly debt payments.   You will need to be confident that you can pay all your debts.  A good rule that I hear is having the ability to pay 6 months worth of debt.  This may not necessarily mean having 6 months worth of cash on hand, but access to that money through personal lines of credit, borrowing against assets, selling stocks/investments, etc. You also want to make sure that your insurance policies fully cover you in the event that a tenant sues you, damages property, etc.  You also don't want to face a situation where you are sued because of discrimination.  Hiring a property management company to take care of these things may be a good peace-of-mind."
Purpose of having good credit when you are well-off?,"Having good credit can be beneficial even if you are well-off for a number of reasons.Better interest rates: If you have good credit, you may be able to qualify for lower interest rates on loans and credit cards. This can save you money in the long run, especially if you plan on borrowing a large amount of money or carrying a balance on your credit cards.Increased borrowing power: Good credit can also give you more borrowing power, which means you may be able to qualify for larger loans or credit limits. This can be useful if you need to make a large purchase, such as a home or a car, or if you need to borrow money for a business venture.More financial options: Having good credit can also open up more financial options for you. For example, you may be able to qualify for credit cards with more favorable terms or rewards programs, or you may be able to get a mortgage at a lower interest rate.Increased financial flexibility: Good credit can also give you more financial flexibility. For example, if you have good credit, you may be able to qualify for a 0% interest credit card, which can be a useful tool for managing your cash flow or financing a large purchase.Improved financial security: Good credit can also help you improve your financial security. For example, if you have good credit, you may be able to qualify for a mortgage with a lower down payment, which can help you build equity in your home more quickly.Overall, having good credit can be beneficial in a number of ways, even if you are well-off. It can help you save money, increase your borrowing power, and open up more financial options and flexibility.","Credit is very important even if you are wealthy. One thing you may not realize is that rich people typically have comparatively little cash on hand.  If they're smart, most of their assets are not liquid - they're tied up in safe, long-term investments.  They use credit for their day-to-day expenses and pay it off from the dividends on their investments (which might only come in once a quarter). There are also tax advantages to using credit.  If a rich person wanted a new car, he'd be smarter leasing it for his business (immediate write-off of the lease payments on taxes) versus buying it (depreciation over several years plus property tax liability in some states).  There are more elaborate tax dodges but the point is that buying a car outright is the worst option in terms of tax avoidance. Another way the rich (mis) use credit is so that they don't risk their own money on business ventures.  Let's say I have $1,000,000 in my personal bank account, and I want to buy a business that costs $1M.  If I am dumb, I clean out my bank account and put all my money in the business.  I get 100% of the profits, but I also bear 100% of the risk.  If I'm smart, I loan 200K of my own money in the business and put the rest someplace safe, and get a loan from a bank for the other 800K.  If the business succeeds, the bank gets their money back plus interest.  If it fails, the business declares bankruptcy and the bank eats the 800k loss. If I structured the debt right, my personal loan to the failed business gets paid back first when the company is liquidated, and the bank gets whatever is left over (if anything).  The most of my own money I can possibly lose is 200k, and probably it's closer to zero if I have a good accountant."
"the difference in taste between people I 'm wondering if people taste the foods I do n't like the same that I do and just like the tastes more , or if our taste buds process the flavor of foods differently . Explain like I'm five. ","Sure! People's taste buds are all different, which means that some people might like different foods than other people. This is because everyone's taste buds process flavors differently. Some people might think a certain food tastes really good, while others might think it tastes bad. It's all just a matter of personal preference. So if you don't like a certain food, it doesn't mean there's something wrong with you.

What are the differences among all these different versions of Vivendi?,"It is not clear which specific versions of Vivendi you are asking about. Vivendi is a French mass media conglomerate with businesses in music, television, film, and telecommunications. The company has undergone various changes and restructuring over the years, and there may be multiple versions or iterations of the company that have existed at different points in time.Vivendi was originally formed in 1853 as a water utility company called Compagnie Générale des Eaux. In the 1980s and 1990s, the company diversified and expanded into other industries, including media and entertainment. In 2000, the company underwent a major restructuring and was renamed Vivendi Universal. In 2006, the company sold off many of its media and entertainment assets and returned to its roots as a telecommunications and media company, adopting the name Vivendi.Since then, Vivendi has continued to evolve and expand its businesses through acquisitions and partnerships. It currently operates in the fields of music, television, film, and telecommunications, and is known for brands such as Universal Music Group, Canal+, and Gameloft.","VIV.PA - is Vivendi listed on a stock exchange in Paris VIVEF - is Vivendi listed on the OTC Other Exchange. VIVHY - is Listed on the OTC:Pink Sheets.  A company can be listed on multiple exchanges, they are known as a dual-listed company. It's a corporate structure in which two corporations function as a single operating business through a legal equalization agreement, but retain separate legal identities and stock exchange listings. Pretty much all DLCs are cross-border, and have tax advantages for the corporations and their stockholders. When a DLC is created, in essence two companies are created and have two separate bodies of shareholders, but they agree to share all the risks and rewards of the ownership of all their operating businesses in a fixed proportion, laid out in a contract called an ""equalization agreement"". The shares of a DLC parents have claim to the exact same underlying cash flows. So in theory the stock prices of these companies should move exactly the same. However in practice there can be differences between these prices. More info on OTC exchanges can be found here - keep in mind this info is from the company that runs these listings. Over the counter stocks are held to a FAR lesser regulation standard. I would recommend doing further interdependent research before pursuing any action."

Why do n't we write them something like onedyone , onedytwo , onedythree ... etc ? Please explain like I'm five.","Great question! The words ""eleven"" and ""twelve"" have been around for a very long time. They come from Old English, and they have stayed pretty much the same since then. The word ""eleven"" comes from Old English ""endleofan,"" which means ""one left"" (since it comes after ten). The word ""twelve"" comes from Old English ""twelf,"" which means ""two left"" (since it comes after ten as well). As for the ""teens,"" they are just the numbers from thirteen to nineteen. They are called the ""teens"" because they all end in the suffix ""-teen,"" which comes from Old English ""ten."" So ""thirteen"" means ""three ten,"" ""fourteen"" means ""four ten,"" and so on.

What is the big deal about the chinese remnibi trading hub that opened in toronto,"The Chinese Renminbi (also known as the Chinese Yuan) is the official currency of the People's Republic of China. A trading hub for the Renminbi in Toronto would allow for greater ease in trading and exchanging the currency, potentially making it easier for businesses and individuals to conduct financial transactions involving the Renminbi. It could also potentially increase the use of the Renminbi as a global reserve currency and enhance Toronto's position as a financial center. It is important to note that the Renminbi trading hub in Toronto is just one of several such hubs around the world, and its significance may vary depending on the context and the specific economic and financial circumstances involved.","Chinese suppliers can quote their price in CNY rather than USD (as has been typical), and thus avoid the exchange risk from US dollar volatility- the CNY has been generally appreciating so committing to receive payments in US dollars when their costs are in CNY means they are typically on the losing end of the equation and they have to pad their prices a bit.  Canadian importers will have to buy RMB (typically with CAD) to pay for their orders and Canadian exporters can take payment in RMB if they wish, or set prices in CAD. By avoiding the US dollar middleman the transactions are made less risky and incur less costs. Japan did this many decades ago (they, too, used to price their products in USD).  This is important in transactions of large amounts, not so much for the tiny amounts associated with tourism. Two-way annual trade between China and Canada is in excess of $70bn.  Of course Forex trading may greatly exceed the actual amounts required for trade- the world Forex market is at least an order of magnitude greater than size of real international trade. All that trading in currency and financial instruments means more jobs on Bay Street and more money flowing into a very vital part of the Canadian economy.

"Postmodernism Surely there 's more to it than "" breaking the fourth wall "" ? Explain like I'm five.","Postmodernism is a complicated and difficult to define philosophical and artistic movement that developed in the second half of the 20th century. One way to understand it is to think about it as a way of thinking and creating that is skeptical of certain ideas and beliefs that have been accepted as true in the past. For example, postmodernists often question grand narratives or ""big stories"" that try to explain everything in the world and how it works, such as the belief in progress or the idea that there is one true way of looking at things. One way that postmodernism has been expressed in art and literature is by ""breaking the fourth wall,"" which means directly addressing the audience as if they are part of the story. This can be used to challenge the idea that there is a clear separation between the ""real"" world and the world of the story, and to question the role of the artist or creator in shaping how the story is told and understood. It's important to note that postmodernism is a broad and complex movement, and there are many different ways that it has been understood and expressed. So while ""breaking the fourth wall"" is one way that postmodernism has been expressed, it is just one aspect of a much larger and more varied set of ideas and practices.","Modernism was a movement in philosophy and the arts in the beginning of the 20th century . Postmodernism was the era after Modernism and can be seen either as a direct response or a continuation of Modernism . The most basic idea behind the difference of Modernism and Postmodernism is this : Modernism constructs and Postmodernism deconstructs . Modernism was all about the "" new . "" New forms , new art , new philosophy , new styles . Postmodernism questions and contradicts and pokes holes at what is current and new . Think about two coworkers in a meeting .

"How can people in tough financial situations can be living in hotels ? Hotels per night are much more expensive than getting an apartment for a month , so what am I missing ? Why would someone choose to do that ? Explain like I'm five.","There can be a variety of reasons why someone might choose to live in a hotel instead of an apartment, even if it's more expensive on a nightly basis. Here are a few possible reasons:

Short-term stay: Sometimes, people need a place to stay for just a few days or a week, and it might be more convenient or cost-effective to stay in a hotel rather than renting an apartment for such a short period of time.

Flexibility: Staying in a hotel can offer more flexibility than an apartment, as you can stay for just one night or several weeks, and you can often easily extend your stay if needed. This can be helpful for people who are unsure how long they will need a place to stay.

Amenities: Hotels often offer a variety of amenities, such as a swimming pool, fitness center, and on-site dining options, which can be convenient for people who don't want to worry about cooking or finding places to eat.

No lease: Some people might prefer to stay in a hotel because it doesn't require signing a lease, which can be helpful for those who are unsure about how long they will need a place to stay or who don't want to commit to a long-term rental.

No upfront costs: Renting an apartment often requires paying a deposit and first month's rent upfront, which can be a financial burden for some people. Staying in a hotel might be a more affordable option, as you typically only need to pay for the nights you stay.

It's worth noting that living in a hotel can be more expensive than renting an apartment in the long run, especially if you need to stay for an extended period of time. However, it can be a good temporary solution for people who need a place to stay on a short-term basis or who don't want the commitment of a long-term rental.",It could be that their finances are in bad shape because they make poor decisions like that .
Music Theory ? I self taught myself guitar and piano when i was 13 and have been playing lead guitar in a band . I always hear about music theory but since i was taught unprofessionally I was never taught it . Explain like I'm five.,"Sure! Music theory is the study of how music works. It helps musicians understand and describe the different aspects of music, such as melody, harmony, and rhythm.

Here are a few basic concepts in music theory:

Pitch: Pitch refers to how high or low a sound is. On a piano, the keys on the left side produce lower pitches, while the keys on the right side produce higher pitches.

Scales: A scale is a group of pitches in a specific order. The most common scale in Western music is the major scale, which has a happy, cheerful sound. There are also other scales, such as the minor scale, which has a sad or serious sound.

Chords: A chord is a group of three or more pitches played at the same time. Different chords have different names and can create different sounds and feelings.

Melody: A melody is a series of pitches played one after the other. It's the main tune of a song and is usually played by a single instrument or sung by a vocalist.

Harmony: Harmony is the sounding of two or more notes at the same time to create a chord. Different chords can be used to create harmony in a piece of music.

Learning music theory can help you understand why certain combinations of notes and chords sound good together and give you more options for creating music. It can also help you communicate with other musicians and understand written music notation.","Music theory is a very , very general topic .

Why are n't we only using wind and solar energy ? Why are n't new housing and business developments build with solar panel roofs ? Why is n't there wind fields all over the place ? Explain like I'm five.,"There are a few reasons why we aren't using only wind and solar energy yet. One reason is that wind and solar energy are not always available. For example, the wind might not be blowing all the time, and the sun might not be shining all the time. This means that we need to have other types of energy, like coal or natural gas, that we can use when the wind and sun are not providing enough energy.

Another reason is that it can be expensive to build wind and solar energy facilities. It takes a lot of money to build the wind turbines and solar panels, and to connect them to the electricity grid. This means that it can be difficult for some countries or companies to afford to switch to using only wind and solar energy.

Finally, wind and solar energy are still being developed and improved, and there are not yet enough of these facilities to meet all of the world's energy needs. This means that we need to continue using other types of energy while we work on building more wind and solar facilities.

Overall, while wind and solar energy are important sources of clean and renewable energy, they are not yet able to meet all of our energy needs on their own.","Solar panels add a significant cost to a building , and take many years to recoup the cost . ( In some places , they never will . ) The same issue exists for wind generators . They are great in some places , but are n't economically competitive in other places . Wind generators are also controversial in some spots , as they will cause some number of birds to die ."

"why Windows would make you choose Run as Administrator and not just give you administrative privileges to begin with . You know , since it 's going to allow those privileges anyway . Please explain like I'm five.","When you run a program as an administrator, it means that the program will have access to more system resources and will be able to make changes to your computer that a normal user might not be able to. This is useful for tasks that require higher privileges, such as installing software or making changes to system settings. 
However, it's also important to be careful when running programs as an administrator, because they can potentially cause harm to your system if they are not used correctly. For example, a program that is run as an administrator could delete important system files or make other changes that could cause your computer to stop working properly. 
By requiring you to explicitly choose to run a program as an administrator, Windows helps to prevent accidental or malicious changes to your system.

I have been trying to concieve for 5 years now.,"It is generally considered safe to take soy isoflavones while taking metformin. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any new supplement, especially if you are trying to conceive or are taking other medications.

Soy isoflavones are plant-based compounds that are similar to the hormone estrogen. They are found in soybeans and other legumes, and are sometimes taken in supplement form. Some studies have suggested that soy isoflavones may help regulate menstrual cycles and improve fertility in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common cause of fertility problems. However, the evidence is not strong and more research is needed to confirm these findings.

Metformin is a medication commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes and PCOS. It works by decreasing the amount of sugar produced by the liver and increasing the sensitivity of muscle cells to insulin, which helps lower blood sugar levels. It is generally considered safe and effective for these purposes, but it is important to follow the dosage and frequency recommendations of a healthcare provider.

It is always a good idea to discuss any changes to your medication or supplement regimen with a healthcare provider before making them.

The success of only Metformin for the treatment of anovulatory infertility is questionable. According to some scientists, Myo inositol brings down the levels of Insulin as well as androgens and hence is more effective in the treatment of infertility due to PCOS. For induction of ovulation, Clomiphene citrate may be tried for 6 cycles (along with Metformin or Myo inositol). If it fails, HMG/hCG combination may be tried. PCOS is characterised by obesity. Please calculate your BMI. You should maintain your BMI between 18 and 23.9 by reducing weight by apt diet and exercises. Soy isoflavones are supposed to improve general health as well as the quality of the eggs, increasing the possibility of successful pregnancy. They are quite safe in your treatment. I hope this will help you to seek for a comprehensive management of PCOS. Please report to your Infertility consultant. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"
Why is EST the standard for saying when something is on ? Such as the Simpsons is on a 8PM EST . Please explain like I'm five.,"EST stands for Eastern Standard Time. It is a time zone that is used as a reference for scheduling events and broadcasts. The reason it is often used as a standard is because it is one of the most populous time zones in the United States, and many people and businesses in the eastern part of the country use EST as their primary time zone. When an event or program is scheduled to be broadcast at 8PM EST, it means that it will be shown at 8PM for people who live in the EST time zone. For people who live in other time zones, the actual time that the event or program will be shown may be different. For example, if you live in the Central Standard Time (CST) zone, which is one hour behind EST, the event or program will be shown at 7PM for you. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.","If you look at a population map of the US , most of our country is still crammed onto the East Coast . The regions covered by Central and Mountain time are relatively sparse , with only a few major cities and much larger tracts of uninhabited ( usually agricultural ) land . So we use EST as the standard because that 's where the bulk of the population is . EDIT : Found [ these ] ( URL_0 ) statistics : > Eastern : 47.0 % Central : 32.9 % Mountain : 5.4 % Pacific : 14.1 % Alaska and Hawaii : 0.6 % EDIT 2 : I also recall an article , although I ca n't find it , in which the author noted that Central Time residents follow Eastern Time . For example , stores that go from 8 am to 8 pm in EST will go from 7 am to 7 pm in CST , so they 're all open at the same time ."
How do we hear ourselves think ? I tried searching for the answer and could n't find it ( on /r / eli5 ) . Any help would be appreciated . Explain like I'm five.,"When you think, your brain sends signals to your muscles to move and to your vocal cords to speak. These actions create sounds that you can hear with your ears. For example, if you are thinking about saying the word ""cat,"" your brain will send a signal to your vocal cords to make the sound of the word ""cat."" The vibrations created by your vocal cords travel through the air and into your ears, allowing you to hear yourself thinking.

However, when you are just thinking to yourself without speaking out loud or moving your body, you are not creating any sounds that you can hear with your ears. So in that sense, you do not hear yourself think in the same way that you hear other people talking or the sounds of the world around you. Instead, your thoughts are more like an internal monologue that happens inside your head.","When we speak out loud there are 2 signals that the brain receives : the internal monologue and ( assuming you are not deaf ) auditory feedback from our speech output . This may be why we tend to think we are speaking louder than we actually are . Your brain also receives a 3rd feedback signal from the articulation / speech muscles . Your brain learns to associate all 3 signals with each other ( thinking a word , with the sound of the word , and the movement of the speech muscles needed to speak the word ) . So if you are thinking internally , your conscious brain will only receive the internal monologue signal . But as I mentioned , the internal monologue is extremely closely related to the production of speech ( this topic is known as "" embodiment "" ) . Studies show that when people read text silently , muscles used for speech are slightly activated . Also , speech production areas of the brain are activated when people speak internally . This all suggests thinking and speaking use similar neural pathways , and so the brain perceives thinking almost like speaking . Note : this is referring to clear - cut intended internal speech . More ambiguous "" thought "" is going to be much more complex . tl;dr : The act of speaking , the sound of speaking , and the internal thought which is correlated with the speech , are all highly associated with each other ( They use similar brain pathways ) . So when you "" hear "" yourself think , it is * probably * because you are activating the same brain pathways used for normal speech and hearing ."
"why we ca n't microwave metals , but some microwaves have metal stands to place our food on ? Yeah , that 's it for my question Please explain like I'm five.","Microwaves are a type of electromagnetic radiation that can heat up the water, fat, and sugar molecules in food. When microwaves hit metal, they can cause the electrons in the metal to move around, which can create sparks and potentially start a fire. This is why it is not safe to put metal in a microwave. 
However, the metal stands in some microwaves are designed to be safe to use because they are coated with a material that does not allow microwaves to pass through it. This means that the microwaves cannot heat up the metal stand and cause any sparks or fires. It is important to check the instructions for your microwave to see if the metal stand is safe to use.","The rule about "" no metal in the microwave "" is actually one that exists more for the sake of simplicity . It is n't a hard and fast rule of science . There * are * times when it 's okay to have metal in the microwave . Metals reflect most of the microwave energy , which is why the microwave oven itself is made of metal -- to keep the radiation inside the microwave oven . A metal bowl , in general , is okay to put in the microwave , provided that it 's completely smooth and does n't ever touch the walls of the microwave . It just reflects radiation around in the oven , but does n't have any sharp prongs to create electrical arcs with . Food products like Hot Pockets have metallic cages that can be used to reflect microwave radiation in a certain way that cooks the food in a desirable way . Whatever metal items come inside the microwave are either designed in a way that wo n't create arcs , or perhaps , they 're made of metal alloys that do n't interact much with the radiation . Such alloys do exist ."
How is the price of VXX determined?,"The price of VXX, which is an exchange-traded note (ETN) issued by Barclays, is determined by the value of the underlying benchmark index that it tracks, which is the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index. This index reflects the returns of a portfolio of futures contracts on the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which is a measure of expected volatility in the S&P 500 stock index.The VIX is calculated using the prices of options on the S&P 500, and it is often referred to as the ""fear index"" because it tends to increase when market conditions are volatile or uncertain. The S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index is designed to provide exposure to the VIX by holding a portfolio of VIX futures contracts with a constant maturity of one month.The value of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index is calculated by the CME Group, which owns the VIX futures contracts, and it is based on the prices of the underlying futures contracts. The value of VXX is then determined by the value of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index, minus any fees and expenses associated with the ETN.It's important to note that VXX is not designed to track the VIX index perfectly, and the value of VXX can diverge significantly from the VIX over time due to the effects of contango and backwardation in the VIX futures market. Contango and backwardation refer to the relationship between the prices of futures contracts with different expiration dates, and they can cause the value of VXX to deviate from the VIX.","Generally, ETFs work on the basis that there exists a pair of values that can be taken at any moment in time: A Net Asset Value of each share in the fund and a trading market price of each share in the fund.  It may help to picture these in baskets of about 50,000 shares for the creation/redemption process. If the NAV is greater than the market price, then arbitrageurs will buy up shares at the market price and do an ""in-kind"" transaction that will be worth the NAV value that the arbitrageurs could turn around and sell for an immediate profit. If the market price is greater than the NAV, then the arbitrageurs will buy up the underlying securities that can be exchanged ""in-kind"" for shares in the fund that can then be sold on the market for an immediate profit. What is the ETF Creation/Redemption Mechanism? would be a source on this though I imagine there are others. Now, in the case of VXX, there is something to be said for how much trading is being done and what impact this can have. From a July 8, 2013 Yahoo Finance article: At big option trade in the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Note   is looking for another jump in volatility.  More than 250,000 VXX options have already traded, twice its daily   average over the last month. optionMONSTER systems show that a trader   bought 13,298 August 26 calls for the ask price of $0.24 in volume   that was 6 times the strike's previous open interest, clearly   indicating new activity. Now the total returns of the ETF are a combination of changes in share price plus what happens with the distributions which could be held as cash or reinvested to purchase more shares."
"A Nuclear Apocalypse Not just the general theory , but also an example of a realistic scenario in this current day and age ? Please explain like I'm five.","A nuclear apocalypse is a catastrophic event that occurs when there is a widespread use of nuclear weapons. It can lead to widespread destruction, death, and long-lasting effects on the environment and people's health. A realistic scenario of a nuclear apocalypse in the current day and age could involve a conflict between two or more countries that have nuclear weapons. For example, if two countries were to go to war and use their nuclear weapons against each other, it could lead to a nuclear apocalypse. This could happen if the countries have a disagreement or dispute that they are unable to resolve peacefully, and they decide to use military force to try to solve the problem. Another way that a nuclear apocalypse could occur is if there was an accidental launch of a nuclear weapon. This could happen if there was a mistake or malfunction in the system that controls the weapon. It's important to note that a nuclear apocalypse would have serious and long-lasting consequences, not just for the countries involved, but also for the rest of the world. It would lead to widespread destruction and death, and it could have serious effects on the environment and people's health. That's why it's important for countries to work together to try to prevent conflicts and accidents that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons.","It is a nuclear war among allies of nations . the threat of nuclear war still exists today , with a number of countries possessing the capability of deploying such destructive devices . In addition to threats from the explosion and radiation , there are also indirect effects such as contaminated food and water supplies , poor air quality , destruction of power grids affecting communication and transportation , and nuclear winter . It ’s been theorized that detonating nuclear weapons will cause large amounts of smoke , soot and debris to enter Earth ’s stratosphere , reducing sunlight for months or even years . Such a nuclear winter would result in severe cold temperatures and interference in food production . In 2007 , scientists Brian Toon and Alan Robock concluded that if India and Pakistan were to launch 50 nuclear weapons at each other , the entire planet could experience 10 years of smoke clouds and a three - year temperature drop ."
I'm only spending roughly half of what I earn; should I spend more?,"It's generally a good idea to save some of your income for the future, but it's also important to enjoy your current income and use it to improve your quality of life. The right balance will depend on your individual financial goals and circumstances.Here are a few things to consider when deciding how much to spend:Your financial goals: Do you have specific financial goals that you're saving for, such as buying a home, paying off debt, or saving for retirement? If you have long-term financial goals, it may be wise to save more and spend less.Your income and expenses: Are you able to comfortably afford your current expenses, or are you struggling to make ends meet? If you're able to save some of your income and still meet your financial obligations, it may be a good idea to save more. However, if you're struggling to pay your bills, you may need to focus on increasing your income or cutting back on expenses.Your personal values: What's most important to you in life? If you value experiences and spending time with loved ones, you may want to allocate more of your income towards these things. On the other hand, if you value financial security and independence, you may want to save more.Ultimately, the right balance between saving and spending will depend on your individual financial goals and circumstances. It's a good idea to create a budget that reflects your priorities and helps you make the most of your income.","Looks like you don't want to participate in the consumerist rush but feel that you just have to do that too. First of all, you don't have to do what you don't want. Then there're researches showing that joy from a compulsive purchase only lasts for a short period of time and then you are left with a relatively useless item in your house. So it's one thing if you really wanted that cool full-electronic sewing machine (or whatever DIY item you might want) to be able to repair all the stuff and craft all the nice things you wanted, but it's another thing if you look at the item and can't decide whether you really need it. The latter scenario is you struggling with the consumerism rush. If you feel really happy and can save half of what you earn just save the difference - it won't hurt. Having a good sum of money saved is really helpful in many scenarios."
"What is sound ? And why is it made ? Seriously , if i flicked a table it would make that quick "" tap "" sound . But why ? Where does it originate ? Explain like I'm five.","Sound is a type of energy that travels through the air or through other materials as a vibration. When an object vibrates, it moves back and forth quickly. This movement causes the air around it to vibrate too, and this vibration travels through the air as a sound wave.

When you flick a table, the movement of your finger causes the table to vibrate. This vibration travels through the table and into the air, creating a sound wave that we can hear.

Sound is made when an object vibrates. The vibrations cause the air around the object to vibrate too, and this creates sound waves that we can hear.","Sound is how our brains interpret vibrations in the air . When you tap the table , it causes the table , your finger , and the air around it , to briefly vibrate . Those vibrations ripple out through the air , much like a wave in water , and reach your ear , where your ear converts the vibrations into neural signals that your brain interprets as sound .

In fact , if you have large speaker set to emit a low enough tone , you can actually see the speaker vibrating in an out ."
"Why mixing red and blue creates violet with shorter wave length than both while mixing red and yellow creates orange , which is something in between ? More details on the way mixing colors work would be great ! Explain like I'm five.","\nWhen we mix colors, we are actually combining different wavelengths of light. Red, blue, and yellow are primary colors, meaning that they cannot be created by mixing other colors together. When we mix two primary colors together, we get a secondary color.\n\nWhen we mix red and blue together, we get violet, which has a shorter wavelength than either red or blue. This is because the wavelengths of red and blue light are at opposite ends of the spectrum and are very far apart. When we mix them together, we get a color that is closer to the shorter, violet end of the spectrum.\n\nOn the other hand, when we mix red and yellow together, we get orange, which has a longer wavelength than either red or yellow. This is because the wavelengths of red and yellow are closer together on the spectrum, and so when we mix them together, we get a color that is closer to the longer, orange end of the spectrum.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.","Mixing colours does n't change the actual wavelength , it 's all about how our eyes detect colour . We have 3 types of colour receptor that roughly correspond to red , green and blue . Each type actually detects a range of wavelengths , but their peak responses are at red , green and blue . When you see light with the wavelength for yellow , both your red and green receptors detect it by about the same amount , which your brain perceives as yellow . So if instead of seeing yellow light , you see an equal mix of red and green light , your eyes ca n't tell the difference . Your red and green receptors are responding by an equal amount so it still looks yellow . Violet is a bit of an odd case . Your red receptors actually have another peak in their response curve around the violet wavelength . It 's only a small peak though , and the response from the blue cone is stronger . But it does mean Violet light can be simulated with blue mixed with a bit of red . Shades of purple and pink with more red than blue "" do n't exist "" .

"How can people buy and sell land if they did n't manufacture it , and at one point , just "" claimed "" it ? This may be a stupid question , but how can you just "" claim "" something and eventually sell it ? Explain like I'm five.","People can buy and sell land because it is a valuable resource that is in limited supply. When people ""claim"" land, they are usually referring to the process of settling an area and establishing ownership over it. This process has varied throughout history and has been influenced by a variety of factors, such as cultural practices, laws, and political systems. One way that land can be claimed is through the process of homesteading, which refers to the practice of settling and cultivating land in order to establish ownership. Homesteading was common in the United States during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and it allowed people to claim land by living on it, building a home, and cultivating the land for a certain period of time. Another way that land can be claimed is through purchase. In many countries, people can buy land from the government or from private individuals who own it. The process for buying land can vary depending on the country and the laws that apply to the sale of real estate. Once land has been claimed and ownership has been established, it can be bought and sold like any other asset. The value of land is often determined by a variety of factors, such as its location, size, and the resources that it provides.","The people who ' just claimed it ' are all dead .

"If everyone starts off as a virgin , how do STDs form / spread ? Edit : So how does one just "" get "" , for example , gonorrhea or chlamydia ? Explain like I'm five.","STDs, or sexually transmitted diseases, are infections that are passed from one person to another through sexual contact. This can include vaginal, anal, and oral sex. STDs can also be transmitted through the sharing of needles or other equipment used for injecting drugs.

There are many different types of STDs, and they can be caused by a variety of different bacteria, viruses, and other organisms. Some common STDs include gonorrhea, chlamydia, genital herpes, HIV, and syphilis.

When someone has an STD, they may not have any symptoms, or they may have mild or severe symptoms. If someone has an STD and they have sex with someone else, they can pass the infection on to their partner. That's why it's important to practice safe sex, such as using condoms, to reduce the risk of getting an STD. It's also important to get tested regularly and to talk to your sexual partners about your STD status.","There 's a fair amount of anecdotal evidence to suggest HIV was contracted from non - human primates by humans , specifically while they would have been preparing the meat of infected non - human primates for consumption , or while hunting a non - human primate who in turn bit their attacker . At least two separate incidents most likely occurred , as HIV-1 and HIV-2 appear to have originated from two distinct species of non - human primates ( chimpanzees / gorillas and mangabeys , respectively ) . STIs or STDs need n't have originated from another species however , as certain types of bacteria and viruses which pose no threat to humans can evolve in to deadly strains . Once the initial humans are infected , STIs or STDs usually spread for the following reasons : 1 . The cause of the disease , such a as a virus , bacteria or fungus , has not been identified or is not properly understood . And humans unknowingly engage in activity which spreads the disease further , such as having unprotected sex or giving blood for transfusions that is not properly screened . 2 . Health organizations refrain from properly respondiong to public health threats as they develop because they are initially isolated to second - class or lower - class citizens for the most part . This is particularly problematic because diseases rarely remain limited to certain classes of citizen , and when they do spread to the rest of the population they are able to do so more quickly if a greater number of second - class or lower - class citizens are infected . Obviously politics play a significant role in this problem as well . ( * To be clear I 'm not suggesting that it is legitimate to treat anyone as a second - class or lower - class citizen , only that societies do so and that this is one of the problems that can arise as a result * )"
How do people with insomnia get energy ? Because when we are out of energy we sleep ? Please explain like I'm five.,"Insomnia is a condition that makes it difficult for a person to fall asleep or stay asleep. When a person doesn't get enough sleep, they may feel tired and have low energy during the day. There are several things that people with insomnia can do to try to get more energy:Practice good sleep hygiene: This means creating a calm and relaxing environment for sleep, establishing a regular sleep schedule, and avoiding activities that might interfere with sleep (such as looking at screens before bed).Exercise regularly: Exercise can help improve sleep quality and increase energy levels during the day.Eat a healthy diet: A well-balanced diet can help provide the energy your body needs to function properly.Get some sunlight: Exposure to natural light can help regulate your body's internal clock and improve sleep.Try relaxation techniques: Activities like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help calm the mind and body, making it easier to fall asleep.Talk to a doctor: If you have tried these techniques and are still struggling with insomnia, it may be helpful to speak with a healthcare professional.

How To Report Cryptocurrency Earnings?,"In the United States, cryptocurrency earnings must be reported on your tax return. This includes any earnings from selling cryptocurrency, as well as any payments made using cryptocurrency.Here are the steps for reporting cryptocurrency earnings on your tax return:Determine if you have a taxable event: A taxable event occurs when you sell or trade cryptocurrency, or when you use it to make a purchase. If you have had any of these types of transactions, you will need to report them on your tax return.Calculate your gain or loss: To determine your gain or loss, you will need to know the value of the cryptocurrency at the time of the transaction. If you bought the cryptocurrency, you will need to know the purchase price. If you received the cryptocurrency as a gift or as payment for goods or services, you will need to determine its value at the time you received it.Report your gain or loss: If you had a taxable event, you will need to report your gain or loss on your tax return. If you had a gain, it may be subject to capital gains tax. If you had a loss, you may be able to claim a capital loss deduction.Keep good records: It is important to keep records of all of your cryptocurrency transactions, including the date of the transaction, the type of cryptocurrency, the value of the cryptocurrency at the time of the transaction, and any fees associated with the transaction. This will make it easier for you to accurately report your cryptocurrency earnings on your tax return.You should consult with a tax professional or refer to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidance on how to report cryptocurrency earnings on your tax return. The IRS has issued guidance on how to report cryptocurrency transactions, including information on what types of transactions are taxable and how to calculate gain or loss.","As cryptocurrencies are rather new compared to most assets, there hasn't been a lot of specific guidance for a lot of situation, but in 2014 the IRS announced that it published guidance in Notice 2014-21. I'm not aware of further guidance that has been published beyond that, though it wouldn't surprise me if treatments changed over time. In that notice, the answer to the first question describes the general treatment: For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. Your specific questions (about what constitutes a ""business"", and when you're considered to be ""selling"" the cryptoproperty) are likely to be considered on a case by case basis by the IRS. As the amounts involved here are so small (relatively speaking), my recommendation would be to read through what the IRS has published carefully, make reasonable assumptions about what scenarios that are described are closest to what you're doing, and document doing so clearly as part of your tax preparations. And when in doubt, erring on the side of whichever option incurs more tax is unlikely to be objected to by them. Of course, I'm not a lawyer or tax advisor, I'm a stranger on the Internet, so for ""real"" advice you should contact somebody qualified. I doubt you'd be faulted too much for not doing so given the amounts involved. You could also attempt contacting a local IRS office or calling them with your specific questions, and they may be able to provide more specific guidance tailored to you, though doing so may not save you from an auditor deciding something differently if they were to examine your return later. There are also phone numbers to contact specific people listed at the end of Notice 2014-21; you could try calling them as well."
Why school systems do n't divide students based on ability rather than age Edit : so many karmas but no karma added :( thanks for all the great responses and front page ! Explain like I'm five.,"The main reason that schools don't divide students based on ability is because it can be very difficult to accurately assess every student's ability. It's also important for students to learn how to work with people of different abilities and backgrounds, and being in a classroom with students of different ages can help them do this. Additionally, grouping students by ability can sometimes create a feeling of competition between students, rather than a sense of teamwork and cooperation. Finally, it can be hard for teachers to design lessons that are suitable for students with a wide range of abilities, so it can be more efficient to teach a group of students who are around the same age.","They already do to an extent ; most honors and AP classes will have students from a couple different grade levels . However , the reason that this is n't done all the time is because school is n't purely for academic learning . It is also important to learn social skills too . For school age children , there is lots of growth between each year . It would be harmful for a 14 year old to spend the entire day around 12 year olds just because he is n't good at schoolwork ."
Why does my wifi signal appear to degrade over time ? I 'm constantly resetting / rebooting my router and/or modem . I should note I live in a small apartment and have gone through 2 high - end routers . Explain like I'm five.,"There could be a few reasons why your WiFi signal is degrading over time. Here are a few possible explanations:

Interference: There are many things that can interfere with your WiFi signal, such as other electronic devices, walls, and even fish tanks.

Distance: The further you are from your router, the weaker the signal will be.

Obstructions: If there are physical objects between your device and the router, such as walls or furniture, they can block or weaken the signal.

Router location: Where you place your router can make a big difference in the strength of your WiFi signal. It's best to keep the router in a central location and as high up as possible.

Router age: As routers age, they can become less effective at transmitting a strong signal. It's possible that your router is simply old and needs to be replaced.

Router settings: There could be something wrong with your router's settings that is causing the signal to degrade. Resetting or rebooting your router might help, but it's also a good idea to check the settings to make sure everything is configured properly.

I hope this helps to explain the possible causes of a degraded WiFi signal. If you continue to have trouble, you may want to consider consulting a professional or purchasing a newer, more powerful router.","Well it might be that you just got two shitty routers , but I doubt that 's really the case since you say they 're high - end routers . So I 'd assume brands like Belkin , Cisco or Linksys . There 's a lot that can have an effect on a wireless signal . Thick walls absorb the signal , metal rebar can act as a faraday cage but since you say you 're in a small appartment I do n't think that 's very likely either . In your case I think the culprit probably is * * your neighbors * * . Yes the friendly folks that you 're borrowing your sugar from . All those people around your probably have WiFi too . And those signals interfere with each other . And as wifi 's become more common and accessible over time more people have gotten it leading to more interference . As a result wifi routers come with better antennae and stronger signals . But that just means everyone starts shouting more loudly . You can use inssider ( yes with double S ) to scope out the wifi traffic in your area and find out which channel is best for you to use . ( or at least not as bad as the others . )"
"How can an Aardvark consume so many ants at once and endure the pain of the ants biting its tongue ? Sort of a left field question , but I was thinking that there would be considerable pain inflicted when consuming a mound of fire ants . Please explain like I'm five.","Aardvarks are nocturnal animals that live in Africa. They have long, sticky tongues that they use to catch insects, such as ants and termites, which make up the majority of their diet. Aardvarks are able to consume large numbers of ants at once because they have thick skin on their noses and tongues that helps protect them from the bites of the ants.When an aardvark sticks out its tongue to catch ants, the ants will often bite the tongue, but the aardvark's skin is thick enough to protect it from the bites. The aardvark's tongue is also coated in a slimy substance that helps to prevent the ants from biting too deeply.Overall, aardvarks are able to consume large numbers of ants without experiencing too much pain because they have special adaptations that help protect them from the bites of the ants.","Not an aardvark , but anteaters have certain defenses : "" To avoid the jaws , sting , and other defences of the invertebrates , anteaters have adopted the feeding strategy of licking up large numbers of ants and termites as quickly as possible — an anteater normally spends about a minute at a nest before moving on to another — and a giant anteater has to visit up to 200 nests to consume the thousands of insects it needs to satisfy its caloric requirements .

"Why has the price of computers stayed roughly the same over time , while the technology that goes into them has improved so much ? Is it really just that the costs to make them have gone down or something else ? Explain like I'm five.","There are a few reasons why the price of computers has stayed roughly the same over time, even though the technology has improved a lot.

One reason is that as computers get more powerful, they also tend to get more expensive to make. This is because they require more advanced and expensive parts, such as processors and memory chips.

Another reason is that there is a lot of competition in the market for computers, which helps to keep prices from getting too high. When there are many companies making computers, they have to compete with each other to sell their products, which can help to keep prices down.

Finally, the cost of making computers has gone down over time, due to advances in manufacturing and other factors. This means that it has become cheaper to make computers, which has helped to keep the prices from getting too high.

Overall, it's a combination of these factors that has helped to keep the price of computers roughly the same, even as the technology has improved.","My first computer was damn near $ 5,000 brand new . My first laptop was almost $ 2,000 . The price of computers has dropped dramatically over time ."
