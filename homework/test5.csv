ENTERTAINMENT,"The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which administers the Oscars, has expelled comedian Bill Cosby and director Roman Polanski, the organization announced in a statement Thursday. Polanski, who won an Oscar for Best Director for the 2002 movie “The Pianist,” will keep his award, an Academy spokesperson told HuffPost. The Academy said its board of governors voted on Tuesday to expel the two men, citing its newly adopted standards of conduct, developed in response to the scores of sexual misconduct allegations against disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. “The Board continues to encourage ethical standards that require members to uphold the Academy’s values of respect for human dignity,” the organization said in a statement. Last week, Cosby was found guilty of sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, among dozens of women who have accused the comedian of sexual misconduct. Polanski has lived in France since pleading guilty to raping then-13-year-old Samantha Geimer (then known as Samantha Gailey) in 1977. He fled the U.S. before his sentencing. The director has also faced allegations of sexual assault from several other women that allegedly occurred when some of them were minors. Last fall, the board of governors quickly voted to expel Weinstein following investigations from The New York Times and New Yorker that revealed years of sexual misconduct allegations against him. At the time, Weinstein was only the second member in the Academy’s history to be removed. This story has been updated to note that Polanski will keep his Oscar."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Jim Carrey’s latest portrait is a haunting tribute to the victims of Monday’s Toronto van attack. The Canadian-American actor has in recent weeks repeatedly used his artwork to take aim at President Donald Trump’s administration. But he radically changed tone Tuesday night with this poignant piece to remember the 10 people who were killed when a man intentionally drove a van into a crowd of pedestrians: I never thought I’d see a tragedy like this in beautiful Toronto. There’s no way to cover your eyes anymore. My heart goes out to the victims and their families. pic.twitter.com/WtTD2TDQmS A man covers his face with his hands in the new portrait that Carrey shared to Twitter. But the subject, who is also covered by a Maple leaf, can’t stop seeing. “I never thought I’d see a tragedy like this in beautiful Toronto,” Carrey captioned the picture. “There’s no way to cover your eyes anymore. My heart goes out to the victims and their families.”"
ENTERTAINMENT,"Actress Ali Wentworth knows she bears a striking similarity to porn star Stormy Daniels. So much so that many people believed it was Wentworth playing the role of President Donald Trump’s alleged former lover on last weekend’s broadcast of “Saturday Night Live,” Wentworth revealed on Thursday’s “Late Night.” “But look at me from the neck up,” she joked to host Seth Meyers.  “I never really read comments on social media, but I was looking at Twitter and there are all these Twitter people saying, ‘Oh my God, I thought that was Ali playing Stormy Daniels on SNL,’ and I thought I can’t tell if that’s a compliment or not,” Wentworth continued. “Then I was looking at pictures of her, she’s an attractive woman, and then I started thinking, ‘What would it be like to do porn?’” she jokingly added. Check out the interview above, and the real Daniels’ appearance on “SNL” here:"
ARTS & CULTURE," ""Film Festivals are still an important outlet for people to find great films. We were able to bring together a significant number of American indie and international films created with limited resources but still incredible art."" (Bryce Renninger)
 3,979 miles from Cannes, 4,147 from Venice and 3,000 from Los Angeles, a diverse international crowd gathered at the Brooklyn Film Festival (now in its 18th year) to celebrate innovative storytelling and filmmaking in the age of the indie. Technology has levelled the playing field, giving artists greater access to the filmmaking process, yet huge challenges remain for those drawn to the world of making and distributing movies. ""Filmmakers are using technology to create amazing things,"" comments Bryce Renninger, the Festival's new Director of Programming. ""But there are many more films and there are many more entertainment choices for audiences."" It is easier, cheaper and even faster to make a film, but how do you make your movie stand out and how do you ensure people actually get to see it?   Renninger notes: ""Film Festivals are still an important outlet for people to find great films. We were able to bring together a significant number of American indie and international films created with limited resources but still incredible art."" 2,331 films from 114 countries were submitted to the Festival. Just 109 films from 26 countries were selected. When the screenings, panels, parties and awards were over, I asked some of this year's winners to share the important lessons they learned while making their newly honored films.
""The creative process of a film is like a Christmas tree. I try to choose really talented collaborators -- people I truly admire, and I'm just trying to get their gifts.""  (Alison Bagnall, Funny Bunny) Joseph Frank (Sweaty Betty -- Awards: Grand Chameleon Award -- Joseph Frank & Zachary Reed, and Best Narrative Feature)   Joseph: Don't try to make a movie above your means. If you are a beginner filmmaker and don't have any financial backing, you have to make a movie that is centered around dialogues.  Props, locations, actors, special effects all cost money that we didn't have.  We knew our story had to be one that takes place in free locations and is character driven with strong dialogue showcasing the characters and the story.   Make a movie about/with people who have strong stories.  We didn't create Sweaty Betty, instead we asked around in our neighborhood for the best stories.  Learn how to professionally record and edit sound yourself or hire a professional sound recorder/editor. I didn't take any classes on producing and I wish I had.  We did mostly everything wrong from a producing standpoint because all we had time to focus on was directing and making the movie.  Make sure you research the producing issues that may affect your movie before or during production.

Alison Bagnall (Funny Bunny -- Awards: Certificates for Outstanding Achievement for Male Actor and Editing)  Alison: The creative process of a film is like a Christmas tree. I try to choose really talented collaborators -- people I truly admire, and I'm just trying to get their gifts. In Funny Bunny I tried to get really comfortable with the feeling of not knowing precisely where we were going. I learned to not be afraid of that feeling. I learned to be humble to the point of self-effacement. I wonder in hindsight if I was purposely acting clueless and confused at times because it creates a power vacuum that others get nervous and feel they have to compensate for. And as a result, I get all their best gifts. Maybe it was calculated and brilliant, or maybe I was just actually clueless. I'm not sure!  ""Work with people who believe in you. It will give you courage and make you much better."" (Alfie Lee, In The Future, Love Will Also) Clayton Allis & Alfie Lee (In The Future, Love Will Also -- Awards: Best Experimental Film and Audience Short Narrative)   Alfie: Work with people who believe in you. It will give you courage and make you much better. There are many ways of getting things done. You just have to start doing them.
Clayton:  We learned to blend our different mediums together -- his music and art, and my filmmaking.  If you truly want to collaborate, then sometimes you have to allow your collaborator to be right even if you may not be sure. Frank Hall Green (WildLike  Awards: Certificates of Outstanding Achievement for Producing, Screenplay and Female Actor)  Frank: Tenacity!  Having a strong determination when the going got tough was key. The process of script to screen is an art. I particularly found it emotionally and creatively challenging to mold my script into actual images. Each day you must change, adjust, cut, alter and then judge that change on how it affects your story. No one cares about your project like you do. Collaboration is key, and finding smart, hardworking people is a blessing. You need to include people and ask their advice. But at the end of the day, it may be you who has to act and get something done. Danya Abt (Eric, Winter To Spring  Awards: Best Short Documentary)  Danya: Be as transparent as you can with your subjects. It will set the tone for your project and your relationship with your collaborators. Find ways to make your subject a partner in the project -- we did long recordings of Eric driving around town with a GoPro in his cab and he would collect unbelievable interactions with passengers. The footage gave us something to collaborate on. Shoot quietly. Eric is an excellent storyteller and I liked hearing his stories so our early footage is very talk-y. I realized we needed to switch things up and usually that meant a very small crew (often just me) needed to hang out until Eric got bored with us.  ""Documentary production is an ever-evolving process, and your story will inevitably change, the deeper you get into production. However, you can't lose sight of that initial conflict that inspired you in the first place.""( Sean Ryan, Born Into This) Lea Scruggs & Sean Ryon (Born Into This -- Awards: Documentary Audience)  Lea: You face the unique challenge of making a film that is both journalistically sound and theatrically thrilling. About halfway into the editing process, we started to get bored with our structure and realized that we should probably rework the storyline, music and images to keep the audience engaged through every scene and transition. We dug up an old children's book about our main character that featured water color illustrations of him as a kid. These helped to salvage our film in the end. As a female filmmaker working on a sports film, I quickly realized that my role would be scrutinized and questioned in ways that a male director would not be. Navigating shoots, editorial feedback sessions and panel discussions about the film showed me that I had to maintain a sense of authority in the storytelling and pride in my role on this documentary.  Sean: We learned each other's strengths and weakness, we communicated about every problem head-on, and most importantly, we made sure the film itself was more important than egos. Documentary production is an ever-evolving process, and your story will inevitably change, the deeper you get into production. However, you can't lose sight of that initial conflict that inspired you in the first place. Robert Machoian (God Bless the Child -- Awards: Certificate of Outstanding Achievement, Cinematography)  Robert: When working with small children, patience is extremely important because they can feel your energy and they do an amazing job of reading your face. The value of good lenses and maximizing the lighting you have access to are important. Understanding what you can do with what you have is often times better than what you tell yourself you need in order to get a specific shot.  For more information

ARTS & CULTURE,"In her 1940 “Self Portrait with Cropped Hair,” Frida Kahlo paints herself in a menswear suit, her long locks lopped off and scattered across the floor like strands of seaweed. In her hand she wields her scissors like a weapon, eyeing the viewer as if posing a challenge. The portrait casts Kahlo as an artist twice over ― not only does she render her androgynous semblance in paint, but she also constructs her gender-fluid persona in real life, over and over again, with every flowing skirt, menswear suit, floral garland or untamed unibrow.  Kahlo is but one in a long line of artists who have used their bodies and their work as sites to exaggerate, manipulate and topple conventional associations of masculinity and femininity. An exhibition currently on view at Creative Growth, titled “Gender Bender,” features contemporary artists who complicate the gender binary through observation, creativity and play ― both on and off the canvas.   Creative Growth is a gallery in Oakland, California, that represents adult artists with developmental disabilities. The gallery is attached to a studio where approximately 160 artists make work alongside a team of staff and volunteers. Not all of the artists have made work before coming to Creative Growth, but once inside the space, they are considered working contemporary artists ― no disclaimers or caveats ― and are encouraged to pursue whatever creative directions they desire. The space was established in 1974 by artist and educator Florence Ludins-Katz and her husband Elias Katz, a psychologist. Appalled by the rapid closure of psychiatric hospitals in California during Gov. Ronald Reagan’s tenure, they opened a space in their garage for former state-hospital patients to make art. In a 1990 book recounting their experience, they explain: “Even though a human being may be handicapped or disabled, this does not change his need to fulfill himself to the greatest of his capacity.’’ Over the past 40 plus years, Creative Growth has earned acclaim not only for its philanthropic mission, but for the exceptional caliber of work its artists consistently produce. One of the most renowned in the gallery’s history is Judith Scott, a woman with Down syndrome and deafness who never learned to speak. She learned to communicate while at Creative Growth in 1987 through weaving wild fiber cocoons that wrapped household objects in their tentacle-like grasp. The sculptures have since been shown around the world, including at the Brooklyn Museum, the Museum of Modern Art and the American Folk Art Museum.  Creative Growth holds approximately seven exhibitions a year, thematically organized around work the artists are already creating. “Our exhibitions result from a dialogue with the artists’ work,” Jessica Daniel, Creative Growth’s community development manager told The Huffington Post. The current exhibition, exploring the ways gender can be expressed and unsettled, is no exception.  “We review work from the studio almost daily and it’s the work itself that inspires the exhibitions,” Daniel said. “We follow the artists’ leads. In fact, a huge component of the Creative Growth process is to never direct the artists, but allow them to discover their own voice, point of view and creative practice.” The current political climate ― formed in part by policies espoused by President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and U.S. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch that threaten the freedom and equality of LGBTQ Americans ― made the topic all the more necessary. “It felt timely and important to engage in the larger conversations of LGBTQ rights,” Daniel said, “especially as the Creative Growth community intersects so often with the LGBTQ community.”  Two Creative Growth artists in particular often return to the imagery of gender in flux. One is Aurie Ramirez, a Filipino artist whose watercolors depict androgynous, Victorian-era, punk-rock royalty, floating atop clouds and drowning in snacks. Her paintings are instantly identifiable in that they depict a recurring visual fantasy, where rocker queens don fishnet tights, garter belts and harlequin face paint, and their clock-faced compatriots dress in snappy, pinstriped suits.  Ramirez, born in 1962, was diagnosed with autism and has difficulty communicating through speech. When she began working at Creative Growth, she fostered obsessions with the band Kiss and the Addams Family, traces of which are sprinkled throughout her images. Ramirez enacts her interest in makeup, masks and performative identities off the canvas as well. She often sports dramatic makeup, with shapes painted Bowie-style across her face.  Casey Byrnes also helped shape the show with his work. He makes ceramic sculptures of the male nude with various body parts stretched out or shrunken. The figures literally treat the human body like a clay sculpture, visualizing just how easy it is to render certain parts alien, absurd and unrecognizable.  Byrnes, like Ramirez, explores the slippery terrain between genders in his daily life, as well. The artist often wears dresses for the annual Creative Growth fashion show fundraiser. “He’s creating a gorgeous woven panel gown that he will wear on the runway this year,” Daniel said.  The remainder of the featured artists employ equally distinct and playful languages to address the more uncanny manifestations of gender expression. In Carrie Oyama’s fragile watercolor-and-ink paintings, drawn with her non-dominant hand, the lines that separate human forms wiggle and shift, a testament to the unfixed nature of being in a body. “Oyama’s delicate figures certainly relate to her awareness of the human body,” gallery associate Chloe Bensahel added, “having been a dancer in New York in the 1970s.”  Artist Terri Bowden lives with legal blindness, and befriended many people with albinism who also have sight impairments. In her work, Bowden often saps both pop culture icons and wild animals of their usual hair and skin tones, imagining what other creatures would look like if they, too, had albinism. In her featured piece, Bowden alters Michael Jackson, endowing him with white tresses and ‘80s-style makeup, making the King of Pop resemble a relative of Debbie Harry.  In “Gender Bender,” the artists of Creative Growth freely express their creative visions and ornate fantasies in a language uniquely theirs. In the safe space of the art center, they can make what they want to make and, more importantly, be who they want to be.  “Creative Growth Art Center is a place where these artists can be themselves and fully have a voice of their own, outside of whatever norms exist beyond these walls,” Bensahel said. “The artists are given the space to investigate and work with whatever fascinates them, and even if it isn’t always explicit, the work is often a result of their direct experience.” The timely show is one amongst a string of recent and upcoming exhibitions similarly grappling with questions of gender, sexuality and identity in the modern world. For Daniel, the significance is clear. “It speaks, we hope, to how artists with disabilities are also just simply artists and individuals in the world.” “Gender Bender” is on view until Feb. 24 at Creative Growth in Oakland, California.  Correction: A previous edition of this article stated artist Terri Bowden herself had albinism. We regret the error. "
ENTERTAINMENT,"To be a cog in the corporate machine is to subject yourself to injustices large and small in the name of eking out a living: tiresome office politics, a jammed printer, a stolen lunch, or worse, sexual harassment. Just look at the seminal “9 to 5,” “Office Space,” “The Office” and “Corporate,” all pop cultural depictions that draw on the inescapable ennui of zombielike number-crunchers and buttoned-up executive assistants who subsist on burnt coffee and keyboard cleaner, waiting for the day their crappy co-workers and abusive bosses get their due.  Netflix and Sanrio’s new anime series “Aggretsuko,” which debuted on the streaming service on Friday, takes the mundane workplace frustration many of us have come to know and cranks the dial to 11. The series follows Retsuko, an endearing red panda who wants nothing more than to get through her work days without incident. And when real life doesn’t measure up to her hopes, she turns to the only thing that temporarily soothes her discontent: death metal.  There’s a lot for Retsuko to get angry about. She works in accounting for some vague corporate entity, one of several lackeys made to tidy the desk of her rage-inducing boss, a literal chauvinist pig. She heads to the office in an overstuffed commuter train, only to have to face a rumor-spreading hippopotamus and a Komodo dragon who loves to dump extra work on her. She faces small, relatable dilemmas outside her job, too: feeling conflicted over how much to give for a wedding present, or simply wanting to shop without constant check-ins from a store clerk.  She gets by thanks to her work buddies — a chill fennec fox with unmatched social-media stalking skills and a hyena in slacks (who, based on Twitter’s consensus, seems to be the most crush-worthy character). She’s in awe of two more experienced colleagues, women who strut down the hallways with an air of #girlboss assuredness, but who actually share many of our titular hero’s insecurities. Retusko channels all of this insecurity and rage into a death-metal hobby that lets her express exactly how she feels. She tries to hide it first from her more intimidating female co-workers and then from a love interest, but realizes her truest self lies within these moments. It’s in these small vignettes where Retsuko is able to be fully unvarnished: “You’re a shitty boss!” she scream-sings during a work happy hour. “Death metal is my soul!!!” she confesses in another episode. The sharp contrast between Retsuko’s adorable outward appearance and her unbridled rage-singing is played for laughs in each of the series’ 10 episodes, yet doesn’t become tiresome. Perhaps because it’s rare to see a female character, animated or not, succumb fully to her anger, especially in a way that’s seen as a net positive. Retsuko’s metal habit provides a private, nondestructive space to contend with the pitfalls of an early-career slog. Requiring a standing appointment at a karaoke bar might be self-care taken to its most extreme, but Retsuko isn’t a role model. She’s just trying to make it through her 20s. The lyrics of Retsuko’s throat-murdering screams are the cherry atop her rage sundae, adapting to fit her crisis du jour. In one episode, she determines that all she needs is a wealthy partner to escape her current drudgery. Cue the metal guitars, and the passionate cry of future financial security: “MATRIMONIAL FREEDOM!” It’s good. American audiences might not immediately associate the show with Sanrio, the Japanese company best known for Hello Kitty. Retsuko, along with Sanrio’s listless egg character Gudetama, stand out from the company’s other happily uncomplicated creations by virtue of their issues. Even Retsuko’s resting “cute” face lacks a smile. The full-length series, inspired by shorts that aired on Japan’s Tokyo Broadcasting System network, hits on an interesting spot. It feels intended for an audience older than do kid-adult crossovers like “Adventure Time” or “Steven Universe.” Yet its lightness — despite all its rage — doesn’t feel quite in line with the darker adult-cartoon stalwart (and fellow Netflix original) “BoJack Horseman.” Still, it’s pointed enough to feel true to life, even if heavy metal isn’t your genre. The series is generally self-aware, of the moment and endearingly weird: Retsuko’s fennec fox friend, for example, details a pattern in their co-worker’s Instagram feed, nailing down her routine of food, selfie and occasional “thigh shot” pictures. But the office caricatures aren’t always charitable. That same ’gram-friendly co-worker, a starry-eyed doe who talks in a baby voice, also allows the gross boss to flirt with her to her benefit. She’s clearly set up as a contrast to Retsuko and company — surely they’d never stoop so low — but her overly ditzy depiction feels a little one-note at first. Each episode is a short 15 minutes, putting “Aggretsuko” in the ranks of Netflix’s other feel-good original fare that requires minimal time commitment (looking at you, “Nailed It”). The effect of catching a handful in one sitting is like having read several culturally savvy comic strips: bright colors, enough for a laugh, but not a lot of narrative depth. Fortunately, “Aggretsuko” isn’t trying for prestige television; it succeeds as a cathartic mirror to contemporary office life — and the activities that sustain us once we’ve punched out.   Looking for more streaming recommendations? Check out the best of what’s new on Netflix, Hulu and Amazon on Streamline."
POLITICS,"Rachel Crooks, who is among the women accusing President Donald Trump of sexual misconduct, won the Democratic nomination for a seat in Ohio’s House of Representatives in Tuesday’s primary election. “We’re still waiting for the final count, but it was uncontested, so we’re happy,” campaign manager Chris Liebold told The Washington Post. “We look forward to the race ahead.”  Crooks, the director of international student recruitment at Heidelberg University in Tiffin, Ohio, claims that Trump kissed her without her consent in the lobby of Trump Tower in 2005, when she worked as a receptionist in the building.  “It was so inappropriate,” she told The New York Times in October 2016. “I was so upset that he thought I was so insignificant that he could do that.”  Trump denied the claim, and said kissing a stranger in a public place would constitute bizarre behavior: A woman I don’t know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago. Never happened! Who would do this in a public space with live security...... Crooks now faces incumbent Rep. Bill Reineke (R) in a historically red district. She said she hopes to gain momentum from female empowerment ― an unprecedented number of women are running for office this year.   “Women are uniting,” Crooks told Cosmopolitan magazine this year. “The momentum is now. I want to be part of it.” A total of 19 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct in claims that range from the early 1980s to 2013. Trump has denied every accusation. "
POLITICS,"A genealogist took commentator Tomi Lahren to task on Twitter after she made controversial comments about immigrants in this country. And she did so with Lahren’s own family history. On Saturday, Lahren went on Fox News’ “Watters’ World” to defend White House chief of staff John Kelly’s remarks on immigrants. Kelly, formerly Trump’s homeland security secretary, told NPR last week that undocumented immigrants are “not people that would easily assimilate into the United States into our modern society.” Lahren went even further and told host Jesse Watters that people who don’t speak English or who come from poverty shouldn’t be allowed to immigrate to the United States. “These people need to understand that it’s a privilege to be an American and it’s a privilege that you work toward. It’s not a right. You don’t just come into this country with low skills, low education, not understanding the language and come into our country because someone says it makes them feel nice,” she said. “That’s not what this country is based on. We are based on the rule of law, and we believe in bringing the best people into this country to make it even better. We don’t believe in importing poverty. Trust me, I live in California. We have enough poverty. We have enough issues. We don’t need any more.” .@TomiLahren: ""You don't just come into this country with low skills, low education, not understanding the language and come into our country because someone says it makes them feel nice. That's not what this country is based on."" @WattersWorld pic.twitter.com/Dux0cABHar The next day journalist and genealogist Jennifer Mendelsohn tweeted about Lahren’s comments and shared some telling details about Lahren’s ancestry. Mendelsohn tweeted that, according to the 1930 census, the political commentator’s great-great-great-grandmother had been living in the United States for 41 years and was still speaking German. Lahren’s great-great-grandmother spoke no English after living in the United States for a decade, and her great-grandfather’s 1884 baptism was recorded in Norwegian. Except the 1930 census says Tomi's 3x great-grandmother had been here for 41 years and still spoke German. Her 2nd great-grandmother had been here for 10 yrs. Spoke no English.Her great-grandfather's 1895 baptism from MN? Recorded in Norwegian.#resistancegenealogy #receipts pic.twitter.com/rIySFu6fvL Mendelsohn later wrote in a series of tweets that “people are people, and always have been.” “Some of our ancestors broke laws, some were model citizens. Some never assimilated or spoke English. Some did. Blind lionization of the people who came before us may be just as dumb as the wholesale demonization of current immigrants,” she wrote. She added, “What I’m trying to show here is that these nativists can’t keep trying to back up their argument by saying ‘the country doesn’t work this way’ when clearly it does, and has: for their families. So why do they *really* not want these people here? That’s what we need to dig out.” Mendelsohn’s message was that Lahren shouldn’t be ashamed of her ancestors but should be aware of where she came from before criticizing others. “As long as people like Lahren continue to push a specious agenda that suggests today’s immigrants are somehow wholly different from previous ones, I’ll keep showing just how alike they really are,” wrote Mendelsohn. Lahren did not immediately respond to a request through Fox News for comment and has not responded to Mendelsohn on social media. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated Mendlesohn was German. She is not, though her Twitter location says she resides there."

Luminor 4-13, 2014, 88 x 78 in. The backstory leading up to the jaw-droppingly beautiful exhibition of new paintings by Stanley Casselman at Brintz Galleries in Palm Beach presents fascinating and engaging clues from the evolutionary road that the artist has traveled since his attraction to manipulating clay as a college student at Pitzer in Claremont, California. The artist's ""Red Sea parting"" moment came while majoring in economics, through the advice of his ceramics professor, David Furman, who persuaded Casselman that he had the natural ability and insight to become a painter and that he should take a painting class. It's a story that has many interesting parallels to those of hugely successful artists like Dale Chihuly, who started out as a textile major, which eventually led him to weaving glass together,and later, creatively expanding molten glass into translucent sculpture; or the billboard painter James Rosenquist, who carried his sometimes dangerous professional experiences from a one-man balancing act on scaffolding high in the air into his downtown Manhattan studio to become a stalwart of Pop Art by appropriating advertising pictures into his compositions. Likewise, Andy Warhol, whose exclusive source material also was borrowed imagery, parlayed his childhood fascination with movie stars into controversial silkscreen paintings that were created by pulling a squeegee across a blank canvas. It also needs to be noted that Roy Lichtenstein first worked as a commercial artist and window dresser, where he cultivated a fascination with cartoons and everyday objects that he captured in his artwork by an idiosyncratic abstraction painted through stencils, and for a time closely resembled Warhol's early paintings. Resemblances in styles and influences then and now are an acceptable and frequently celebrated reality in picture-making, where artists deliberately overlap with each other, often inseparably like the early experimental Cubist works of Picasso and Braque, which for years were identical as they continued to break down compositional conventions, and preceded the ultimate reuse of the printed page with the invention of collage. At some point, however, they went their separate ways.
IR 38 10, 30 x 30 in. Permanent Collection of Colorado Springs Museum. In Casselman's case, the familiarity with textures, coupled with the thick, tactile, earthy nature of clay that he manipulated with rubber and metal-edged ""ribs,"" naturally and eventually carried over to his unique approach to painting, which he has been exploring for over twenty-five years.  While in college, he used those ribs, essentially mini-squeegees, to define, mold or uncover hidden layers -- techniques that he continues to use on a much bigger scale today, as he methodically spreads paint across a tightly-stretched canvas. Through years of trial and error and always with his myriad of custom-built squeegees, Stanley Casselman has carefully crafted his personal iconic surfaces that began to get results and draw critical attention.
IR 41 10, 2014, 49 x 49 in. Collection of Anne and Clay Rorbach. Then, as luck would have it, after a work by Gerhard Richter sold at auction for a staggering $34.2 million, along came a challenge on Facebook proposed by Jerry Saltz, eminent art critic for New York magazine, which challenged artists to produce a painting in a perfect Richteresque-style for just $155, and Saltz would come for a studio visit. The thought of having one of Manhattan's most important critics visit Casselman's studio seemed too good for him to pass up, yet he was quite conflicted about the idea of copying Richter, or anyone, for that matter.  However, caution to the wind, he set out to decode Richter's language.  Encouraged by the ongoing explosive experiments and the promising results in his studio, Casselman knew he had something and indeed he succeeded.  Saltz visited and got his painting; $155 changed hands; but Jerry was so taken by what Casselman had created that he decided to write a feature story about it in New York magazine.


Stanley Casselman working in his studio. The best part of this historic tale is that in Casselman's paintings -- what led him here aside -- he's created a novel syntax that doesn't exist in Richter's repertoire. His recent small and large-scale works have been well received and seem to go well beyond Richter's standard fare. In addition, Casselman has perfected a delightful surface consisting of the unique practice of meticulously applying thick and thin paint, then pulling a squeegee across the canvas surface both vertically and horizontally, resulting in brilliant colors flowing and merging together to form a cohesive visual statement. Casselman, like an architect, plans well ahead to construct a strong, painterly foundation, which allows him to explore an adventuresome journey that ultimately provides structure, density, layering, fluidity, harmonic movement, spatial illusion and rich texture with a propensity for producing truly powerful works of art.
Brintz Galleries Installation  I'm reminded of the remarkable similarities between Casselman's background and serendipitous ""luck of the draw"" and that of acclaimed artist Harold Shapinsky, whose ""discovery"" was the subject of a lengthy feature article in The New Yorker in 1985. Shapinsky was a young man when he began painting abstract expressionist-based works in total obscurity, which he continued refining every day for over thirty years before he was noticed by accident. He had studied briefly with de Kooning and Motherwell, and then he diligently built a hybrid style that was associated closely with de Kooning's; in fact, Shapinsky's work often was misinterpreted as that of de Kooning. But curators and critics, including Kenworth Moffett, former director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, argued that Shapinsky perhaps was more original, and questioned ""who came first?"" His first exhibition in America was at my Palm Beach gallery, which nearly sold out, and included a painting that was purchased by Henry Ford. Next for Shapinsky was an acquisition by the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., and other museums, and finally an auction at Sotheby's, with the final sale amount ten times that of the original gallery price.

In a way, Casselman was indirectly ""discovered"" when he took on a challenge that coincidentally pushed him forward and into the spotlight. Like Shapinsky, he was influenced by a universally recognized artist, but also like Shapinsky, he developed an engaging style of his own making through painstaking investigation that is now paying off both critically and financially. Museums are beginning to collect his work; shows are selling out in New York, California and London; reviews are coming in from The New York Times, Forbes, The Wall Street Journal and New York magazine; as well as a recent Phillips auction with one of his works bringing a stellar price. It's a pretty astonishing connection between these two artists.

Even without the amazing backstory or the arm's-length attachments; appropriations aside, and with subtle coincidences and other obscure references to Rothko, Frankenthaler, Joan Mitchell, and others; these works offer a remarkable singularity of character, resourcefulness and a confidence of spirit that is refreshing, stimulating and striking all at once. Casselman offers an impressive, revealing visual parallel to a geologist's study of the layers of the earth's surface as moved by a force of nature or gravity, full of revelation and knowledge.

POLITICS,"By Valerie Volcovici and Karen Freifeld WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that he has asked the Commerce Department to help Chinese technology company ZTE Corp “get back into business, fast,” a concession to Beijing ahead of high-stakes trade talks that will take place this week. ZTE, one of the world’s largest telecom equipment makers, suspended its main operations after the U.S. Commerce Department banned American supplies to its business for seven years. Trump’s offer to help comes as Chinese and U.S. officials prepare for talks in Washington with China’s top trade official Liu He to resolve an escalating trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies.  In trade talks in Beijing earlier this month, China asked the United States to ease crushing sanctions on ZTE, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Trump’s reversal could have a significant impact on shares of American optical components makers such as Acacia Communications Inc and Oclaro Inc which saw their stock prices fall when U.S. companies were banned from exporting goods to ZTE. ZTE paid over $2.3 billion to 211 U.S. exporters in 2017, a senior ZTE official said on Friday. “Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!” Trump wrote on Twitter, saying he is working with Chinese President Xi Jinping on a solution. President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done! The U.S. government launched an investigation into ZTE after Reuters reported in 2012 the company had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars’ worth of hardware and software from some of the best known U.S. technology companies to Iran. (Reuters report that exposed the practice: https://reut.rs/2GbpCmO) ZTE pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions by illegally shipping U.S. goods and technology to Iran and entered into an agreement with the U.S. government. The ban is the result of ZTE’s failure to comply with that agreement, the Commerce Department said. The ban came two months after two Republican senators introduced legislation to block the U.S. government from buying or leasing telecommunications equipment from ZTE or Huawei [HWT.UL], citing concern the companies would use their access to spy on U.S. officials. ZTE relies on U.S. companies such as Qualcomm Inc and Intel Corp and American companies are estimated to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of the components used in ZTE’s equipment, which includes smartphones and gear to build telecommunications networks. The Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Republican Representative Robert Pittenger, a sponsor of legislation that would strengthen the U.S. national security review process for foreign investment, said after the Commerce ban was announced that the United States “must be vigilant against Chinese threats to both our economic security and national security.” Experts said Trump’s policy reversal was unprecedented. “This is a fascinating development in a highly unusual case that has gone from a sanctions and export control case to a geopolitical one,” said Washington lawyer Douglas Jacobson, who represents some of ZTE’s suppliers. “There’s no legal mechanism for this. How this will play out remains to be seen. They are not simply going to be able to resume business as usual,” he said. ZTE suppliers including Acacia, Oclaro, Lumentum Holdings Inc, Finisar Corp, Inphi Corp and Fabrinet, all fell sharply after the ban was announced. Shares of Acacia, which got 30 percent of its total revenue in 2017 from ZTE, hit a record low after the ban was announced. Oclaro, which earned 18 percent of its fiscal 2017 revenue from ZTE, fell 17 percent. (Reporting by Valerie Volcovici, Karen Freifield and Chris Sanders; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)"
BUSINESS,"By Rieva Lesonsky The end of the year is a good time for small and midsize business owners who benefit from U.S. consumers’ holiday spending spree. Twenty percent of the annual revenues the average small and midsize business earns comes in between Thanksgiving and Dec. 31, the second national SMB & Money Survey reports. For companies that sell products, this time of year is even more profitable; they earn an average of 28 percent of their annual revenues at year-end. But it’s not all good news, according to the survey, which was conducted by Survata for WePay. More than 70 percent of the business owners surveyed say they faced at least one serious business problem during last year’s holiday season, the most common being late payments. More than 21 percent of small and midsize businesses surveyed struggled with late payments between Thanksgiving and Dec. 31, 2016. What’s more, over two-thirds of those surveyed say at least 10 percent of their customers fail to pay on time. When your business doesn’t get paid on time, it not only puts a major crimp in your cash flow, but it also eats up valuable time you could be spending on more important things. Nearly six in 10 business owners in the survey say they have to follow up at least twice to get late-paying customers to meet their obligations. Even small business owners who get paid immediately at the point of purchase, such as retailers and e-commerce businesses, struggle with their own financial issues during year-end. More than one-fourth (26 percent) of respondents say they lost money to fraud or chargebacks (disputed charges) in the last 12 months; 22 percent of those lost $5,000 or more. Making matters worse, if you have too many chargebacks, you may run into problems with your payment processing company. RELATED: 4 Rules to Cure a Cash Flow Crisis If you don’t want to be one of these statistics, it’s important to take steps to protect your business. Here are some tips to reduce chargebacks: Analyze the reasons behind your chargebacks. Chargebacks can be caused by credit card fraud, such as stolen cards, or by “friendly fraud,” in which customers order products online and then claim they never received them and ask for a refund. If your website doesn’t provide accurate, detailed product descriptions, you may also end up with a high number of chargebacks from dissatisfied customers when the products aren’t what they expected. Maintain proper website security and follow the payment processing protocols recommended by your payment processing company. Make sure the descriptor (the business name that appears in customers’ credit card statements) is recognizable as your business. When customers don’t recognize a descriptor, they often assume they’ve been charged in error and dispute the charge. For sales transacted in person, always check the customer’s identification and make sure that the signature on the credit card matches their signature. If your problem is late payers, the best defense is being proactive. Follow these tips to get your customers to pay on time: Send invoices immediately upon delivery of products or services. Use electronic payment acceptance and online invoicing to speed things up. Make sure you send your invoices to the correct address, department, and individual. Design invoices that are easy to read and clearly state the amount due, due date and how to pay. Follow up with customers as soon as a payment is late. The faster you act, the more likely you are to get paid before the year is up. For customers that consistently pay late, you’ll have to consider whether it’s worth continuing to do business with them. If you decide to keep working with late payers, institute policies to protect your business such as requiring cash on delivery or partial payment upfront. Financial issues can quickly spiral into ongoing cash shortages that can destroy your business. Whether your money problems spring from chargebacks, fraud, or late-paying customers, take steps to get them under control before year-end.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Milo Yiannopoulos claims he will self-publish his book Dangerous after his comments about pedophilia forced publishing giant Simon & Schuster to drop its deal with the alt-right figure. He announced the news late last month over Facebook. In a separate message posted Saturday, Yiannopoulos stated he plans to sue the publisher for $10 million to “send a message.” “We are going to make publishers, professors and journalists who threaten free speech famous ― and ashamed,” he wrote. The former Breitbart editor said Dangerous will be the first project under his new umbrella, Dangerous Books, an endeavor made for those whose work might otherwise be determined unpublishable.  (Bear in mind: Even President Donald Trump’s last book, titled Great Again: How to Fix Crippled America, was deemed publishable by a major imprint.) His original deal with Simon & Schuster was canceled in February. Although Yiannopoulos has a history of controversial comments ― he once equated feminism to “cancer” and led the charge on the racist, troll-fueled harassment of comedian Leslie Jones over Twitter ― it wasn’t until he made a comment seemingly condoning pedophilia that the publisher pulled the plug.  He lost a major speaking gig, and his job at Breitbart, the same week.  “This will not defeat me,” Yiannopoulos said at the time. Shortly after, HuffPost observed that, while his message had been invalidated by trusted outlets, the controversial character would likely self-publish his work anyway. Now, he’s announced just that. Self-publishing is a popular route for writers who are unable to find a traditional home for their books. But the market is “challenging,” Mark Coker, founder of ebook distributor Smashwords, said in a January interview with Publisher’s Weekly, due to the “flood of titles that have entered the ebook space.” Yiannopoulos said he will release Dangerous after touring campuses under Milo, Inc., a new media venture centered on live events. The self-proclaimed supporter of free speech said in a statement that he will focus on “making the lives of journalists, professors, politicians, feminists, Black Lives Matter activists, and other professional victims a living hell.”  The First Amendment, of course, protects the freedom of speech, but also the freedom of the press. According to Vanity Fair, Yiannopoulos claims to be supported by a $12 million investment from anonymous backers. And, he says he personally has access to “all the funniest, smartest, most interesting young YouTubers.” “I’m going to be actively hunting around for the next Milo,” he said. “The generation that’s coming up [...] They love us. They love me.” "
ENTERTAINMENT,"One of President Donald Trump’s greatest adversaries appears to be the subject of Jim Carrey’s latest biting political portrait. The actor-turned-artist seemingly took aim at former FBI Director James Comey with the new picture he shared online Monday: The road to Trump’s White House was paved with good intentions. ;^\ pic.twitter.com/YzOnLjJsxk The portrait shows a man who looks like Comey being told during confession: “Of course God forgives you, my son. But the rest of us aren’t quite there yet!” The image is captioned: “The road to Trump’s White House was paved with good intentions.” The caption appears to refer to Comey’s admission in his new book, A Higher Loyalty, that he believed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would defeat Trump in the 2016 election and that expectation may have influenced his handling of the investigation into her use of a private email server. In recent weeks, Carrey has used his artwork to mock Trump, his allies and various members of his administration ― including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani: Ghouliani: Finally, a face we can trust! 8^¥ pic.twitter.com/IU1IG8sf0T Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen: Auto-moronic ASSphyxiation. ;^P pic.twitter.com/VA6mmkjtk0 Fox News host Sean Hannity: Sean Manatee: some endangered species aren't worth saving! ;^P  #SeanHannity pic.twitter.com/UL2wHRAzJb And Trump himself: Did anyone watch 60 minutes last night?

ARTS & CULTURE,"Written in 1985, Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale has never been out of print. So to call renewed interested in the beloved dystopian story a “resurgence” might be disingenuous ― the book’s popularity was never in question.  Nonetheless, as President Donald Trump has ascended to the highest public office and policymakers have suggested revoking basic women’s rights, the story of Gilead ― a militant and theocratic future-version of the United States reliant on a group of sexually enslaved handmaids to repopulate its dwindling republic ― evokes a different kind of urgency. Perhaps that’s why the new Hulu adaptation of the book, starring Elisabeth Moss, is stirring up enough political parallels that people are clamoring to buy, borrow or read by whatever means necessary Atwood’s original source material. (Even high school teachers are using the book to talk about America today.) Thanks to a public artwork in New York City, anyone trying to get their hands on the book can do so free of charge. A massive installation on Chelsea’s elevated park, the High Line, designed by graphic artists Paula Scher and Abbott Miller, houses 4,000 complimentary copies of The Handmaid’s Tale.  Yes, passersby can simply take a book from the massive installation, no charge whatsoever, and return home with a free novel that warns of a dictatorial future. By removing the books from the wall, participants will reveal “messages of female empowerment and anti-authoritarian resistance,” including the novel’s central battle cry: “Nolite te bastardes carborundorum,” or “Don’t let the bastards grind you down.” “The Handmaid’s Tale provides a chilling reminder of how easily the darkest currents of repression can re-surface,” the artists expressed in a statement. “The installation we designed shows how these dark messages are often accompanied by bombastic language and imagery: spectacle becomes a form of persuasion. Cracks in the floorboards reveal empowering texts, glimpses of resistance for an uncertain age.” The glorified public bookshelf, flanked by stunning images of the handmaids from the book and show, will be open through April 30, near the High Line’s 16th Street entrance. The Hulu series, for those who’ve yet to binge on its first three episodes, began streaming on April 26."
ENTERTAINMENT,"“Magnum P.I.” was rebooted, but the lead actor’s pornstache was not. A trailer released Wednesday shows Jay Hernandez, who will play the title role made famous by Tom Selleck in the ’80s series, sporting some facial hair. But it’s nothing like the hirsute caterpillar that covered Selleck’s upper lip. The new Magnum appears to still love revving up his red Ferrari and courting danger in Hawaii ― but doesn’t seem keen on 21st-century ride-sharing. After his Ferrari gets wrecked in the preview, he says he needs a car. To which the new Higgins (British actress Perdita Weeks) replies, “Call an Uber.” “What am I, 19?” the PI fires back. “Magnum P.I.” is slated for Mondays on CBS’ fall schedule.

ENTERTAINMENT,"Maybe you watched the royal wedding from your home, bleary-eyed in a stained robe and binge-eating day-old scones from the grocery store. But if you’re Aaron Korsh, creator of the TV show “Suits,” you went to the royal wedding IRL and soaked up the majestic ceremony with the likes of Oprah, and George and Amal Clooney. Korsh wrote an open letter about his day attending the wedding of his friend and former “Suits” star Meghan Markle to Prince Harry. In an impassioned post on Twitter, he called the experience “the most extraordinary thing I’ve ever seen.”  I was asked to write something for The New York Daily News, they were kind enough to print some of it.  Here’s the rest... #RoyalWedding pic.twitter.com/dkzncEeNTL Korsh, asked to write about the ceremony for the New York Daily News, decided to share his sentiments on social media. “From the second we left our castle-esque hotel to the drive up to and through Windsor, to the walk to the Chapel and then afterwards to the reception, it was one once in a lifetime experience after another,” he wrote. Korsh told the Daily News that “Harry looked earnest and somehow vulnerable, while Meghan looked strong and proud and regal and beautiful. “To have a mix of cultures on so many levels and to have two such capable ambassadors showing the world how it should be done was moving beyond words,” he told the publication. Korsh mentioned rubbing elbows with the likes of Sir Elton John and Idris Elba, gushing that it was all a “dream.” He concluded his letter by saying “it felt like the world was becoming a better place” and that his life will “forever be richer for having those memories.” Anyone else having major FOMO?"
POLITICS,"Believe it or not, other things have been happening the past few days besides Michelle Wolf’s comedy routine at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner.

ARTS & CULTURE,"The New York art scene isn't only about New York anymore: across the country, artists are collaborating digitally and virtually; gallerists are looking beyond their own backyards for work; and buyers are venturing to neighborhoods outside of Chelsea and Williamsburg to discover the next art star.   Case in point: Near the railroad tracks on Atlanta's Westside, artist Karen Schwartz paints in her studio. Through the open window, the sound of birds wafts into the space along with shafts of sunlight. When I meet Schwartz for an interview in April, she is preparing for a one-woman show in Brooklyn, New York, and her nearly-finished work surrounds us. Expressionist yet contemporary, the figurative paintings are dark and deliberate, with a sense of humor and a fluidity marked by bats, bunnies and other animal references that flutter, bounce and stomp through her canvases. Schwartz says it required a lot of deep digging to do the ""physical and visceral"" work of self-discovery that these emotive paintings transmit. A native New Yorker who headed South to earn a doctorate in psychology,  Schwartz, a practicing psychotherapist, began to fully realize her artistic talent when she attended the Fine Arts Atelier at the King Plow Arts Center.  Here she met fellow New York transplant, Michael David, a prominent painter who became her teacher and mentor. David teaches in Atlanta and is also the curator for Life on Mars Gallery in Bushwick, a neighborhood in Brooklyn that's exploding with art spaces of every size and kind. Schwartz's show, titled ""Down the Rabbit Hole,"" opened at Life on Mars April 24 and runs through May 31. Although it's not specifically dedicated to the memory of her mother, who passed away while Schwartz worked on the series of paintings, the collection displays an element of feminism disguised as motherhood - that of her mother and her own.  Schwartz admits it was difficult to fly the ATL-LGA route several times per month to be with her mother during her last year.  Yet, the cacophony of Manhattan faded each time she stepped into her Atlanta studio. ""There's something freeing about getting out of the center of the action. I think painters have always done this,"" Schwartz says.""It's stimulating to capture something with your mind and then to be alone with it somewhere else."" The heartache was not erased by the miles nor the Southern train whistle on the nearby tracks, however. The result of the months of back-and-forth travel influenced a show that is full of vibrant hues, edgy lines and vigorous motion punctuated by resolute stillness and sadness. The red lipstick that dances across the mouth of ""Pink Lady,"" a portrait in Schwartz's show, says it all: in life and in art, it's easy to paint on a smile to mask the layers of emotions underneath. What's more difficult is to convey the nuances as brilliantly as Schwartz has done in her work. It's fitting that the exhibition is up during Mother's Day; last year Life On Mars hung a group show called Motherlove, which also featured Schwartz's work, along with paintings by Joan Snyder and quilt artists Mary Lee Bendolph and Loretta P. Bennett. This year, the theme of celebrating women artists continues: the gallery continues its nod to ""The Women of Ab-Ex"" with a May 20 symposium featuring art scholar Eleanor Heartney; Norman Kleeblatt, chief curator of The Jewish Museum; art historian/author Irving Sandler; and critic Phyllis Tuchman.)

ENTERTAINMENT,"Patton Oswalt is not just a devoted nerd, he’s an incredibly intelligent and thoughtful nerd. In 2012, he appeared on “Parks and Recreation” and ranted for eight minutes straight, outlining his brilliantly detailed plot for a Star Wars-Marvel crossover film.  On Saturday, Oswalt knocked around a theory about “The Dark Knight” ― specifically about the origin of Heath Ledger’s Joker. The 2008 film explains almost nothing about where the character came from, but some fans have theorized that because of his fighting style and familiarity with weapons, the Joker is a war veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Oswalt takes that idea further and asks, “What if he’s not only ex-military, but ex-military intelligence?”  This theory makes a lot of sense and adds clarity to some of the Joker’s lines throughout the film. For example, he says of one character, “I know the squealers when I see them.” Or the scene in the police interrogation room where Batman slams the Joker’s head on the table, and the villain says, “Never start with the head. The victim gets all fuzzy.” “The Dark Knight,” for which Ledger posthumously won an Oscar, celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. Cleary, the award was well-deserved given that people are still finding new ways to look at the performance a decade later."

BUSINESS,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc <VZ.N>, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, said on Tuesday it agreed to buy the core internet business of Yahoo Inc <YHOO.O> for $4.48 billion, about $350 million less than the original price. The deal will combine Yahoo’s search, email and messenger assets as well as advertising technology tools with Verizon’s AOL unit. Verizon had been trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the agreement to reflect the economic damage from two cyber attacks. The closing of the deal, which was first announced in July, has been delayed as the companies assessed the financial fallout from the breaches that Yahoo disclosed last year. The companies said on Tuesday they expect the deal to close in the second quarter. Under the amended terms, Yahoo and Verizon will split cash liabilities related to some government investigations and third-party litigation related to the breaches. Yahoo will continue to be responsible for liabilities from shareholder lawsuits and Securities and Exchange Commission investigations. Verizon has been looking to mobile video and advertising for new sources of revenue outside the oversaturated wireless market.   (Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal and Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)"
ENTERTAINMENT,"A year after the first season of Netflix’s “13 Reasons Why” sparked a debate over its unsettling depiction of teenage suicide, showrunner Brian Yorkey has unfurled a new, increasingly graphic batch of episodes. One in particular, however, has people talking. And it features not one but two significant events that, when taken together, equate to a highly disturbing finale. (Warning: The below description may be unsettling to some readers.)  “13 Reasons Why” Season 2 picks up where the last season left off, focusing primarily on how the students of Liberty High School are recovering from the tragic death of Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford) and the ensuing legal battle between her parents and the school. But the final episode stands apart from Hannah’s narrative. It features one of the most horrifying and heartbreaking scenes I’ve ever seen on television. The scene occurs midway through Episode 13, dubbed “Bye.” Tyler (Devin Druid), who recently returned to school following a stint in behavioral rehab after he was caught vandalizing the baseball field, is confronted in a bathroom by Monty (Timothy Granaderos) and two other student-athletes. Monty, a close friend of villainous jock Bryce (Justin Prentice) ― who has somehow gotten away with raping both Hannah and Jessica (Alisha Boe) ― is still reeling over the fact that Tyler ruined Liberty’s baseball season. When Monty sees that Tyler’s back at school, he plans to make him suffer.  So Monty and his friends initiate a sequence of male-on-male violence rarely seen on-screen. First, they smash Tyler’s head against a mirror and sink. Then they shove his head in a toilet, pinning him down. Monty proceeds to sodomize Tyler with a mop handle, aggressively pushing it deeper into Tyler’s rectum as the teen cries out in agony. When the heinous act is completed, the young men leave Tyler there, petrified, bleeding and bruised. It’s a stomach-churning two minutes worth of storyline, which Druid ― along with fellow cast members Boe, Dylan Minnette, Ross Butler and Christian Navarro ― discussed in an interview with HuffPost on Tuesday. “When it did come time to get to the final episode and [showrunner] Brian [Yorkey] was walking me through this idea of what would happen to Tyler, it was incredibly intimidating,” he told me during a Build Series segment in New York City. “Because you’re suddenly given this responsibility to portray this horrific thing that unfortunately happens to many people around the world, and to a lot of young people these days.” “But then you think about what you’re doing and the greater impact that it will hopefully have on people’s lives,” he added, “and it does kind of fill you with a sense of bringing justice to something and saying, hopefully, this is helping someone and that will make me feel much better about what we’re doing here.”  The “horrific thing” Druid mentioned, “that unfortunately happens to many people,” is a reference to the sexual assault his character was forced to endure. But it could also refer to the violence Tyler almost enacts on his peers: Shortly after the assault scene, “13 Reasons Why” has Tyler attempting to seek revenge on his classmates by showing up to a school dance with an automatic weapon. This is how the season ends. With a panicked Clay (Minnette), rifle pointed at his chest, pleading with Tyler outside the school to reconsider his next move as sirens blare in the background. “I don’t want you to die,” Clay tells him, tears streaming down his face. Tyler appears to be questioning his motives as Clay lowers the gun. “We’ll figure it out, I swear,” he tells Tyler. That’s when Tony (Navarro) pulls up in his car and screams at Tyler to get in, leaving Clay, weapon in hand, alone as the cops approach. It’s a plot decision that ― like Hannah’s suicide scene from last season ― has caused a divisive rift in the show’s fandom. 13 reasons why does not “raise awareness for mental health, bullying, etc.” it’s a disgusting show that show’s horrific/traumatizing/triggering scenes. that is NOT raising awareness. 13 reasons why is a good show, it discusses things (in my opinion) in a respectful manner, but what we must be aware of is that it IS graphic and it warns of this many times. If you are suffering with mental Illness this will hit hard, I am not a professional but I wouldn’t- 13 reasons why just exploits the idea of mental illnesses for cash money Y’all don’t like “13 Reasons Why” because it makes you talk and think about uncomfortable topics such as Rape, Suicide and Sexual Assualt. All these topics that people try their best to ignore and you see what happens when you ignore it? All these things continue to happen. I really don’t know how 13 reasons why manages to get away with showing the kind of scenes that they do, I’m not a sensitive person but they turn my stomach, god knows what affect they have on those who have experienced it you can shit on #13ReasonsWhy as much as you want, but if only 1% can relate to it and feel better about their situation or less lonely with their struggles the series has it job done. every1 suffers differently from mental illness so it's impossible to represent every1 out there “I was aware that there were some warning precautions, but the [assault] scene was very vulgar and unnecessarily uncomfortable ― not for the sexuality part but for how much emotion and intensity it had,” Kendal Wiley, a 19-year-old fan of the show from Burleson, Texas, told HuffPost.  Yorkey himself defended the scene to Vulture: We’re committed on this show to telling truthful stories about things that young people go through in as unflinching a way as we can ... the fact is that, as intense as that scene is, and as strong as our reactions to it may be, it doesn’t even come close to the pain experienced by the people who actually go through these things. “We all take this very seriously and I think it’s a big responsibility for each of us, but it’s a privilege, as well,” Navarro emphasized to HuffPost, noting that, as actors on “13 Reasons Why,” the cast is often expected to speak to the series’ controversial subject matter. “I don’t think any of us imagined we would be on a show with this level of importance,” he said. “The impact that it’s had here in the States and than globally took us for a surprise, so we’re still dealing with that every day.” The show, Navarro said, was written and produced before the various instances of violence on school properties in 2018. “But [school shootings are] prevalent and our show helps to spark a conversation,” he added, “as it did last year with suicide and bullying and sexual assault. Hopefully the same conversation will be sparked this year with gun violence.” “That’s our goal with the show,” Minnette said, “to speak to teens, to speak to people any age, really, and just start conversations. Important ones.” Of course, public debates about gun violence existed before the second season of “13 Reasons Why” premiered. They existed before 2018, too, but ramped up in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, shooting. Moreover, the conversation that the show has started is not limited to school shootings. It entwines a brutal instance of sexual assault with a disturbing brush with gun violence, making it seem as though the former caused the latter. The character of Tyler faced his fair share of mistreatment throughout the series, from Hannah’s rejection of his apology for photographing her through her bedroom window to Clay’s decision to share a private photo of him with the entire school. Those moments led bullies like Bryce and Monty to incessantly belittle Tyler, mooning and pantsing him in the hallways. By the end of Season 1, we watch as Tyler purchases guns; by the conclusion of Season 2, we see him ready to use them.  To foreshadow his storyline is one thing. To cram Tyler’s tragic rape scene and school-shooter narrative into the last 30 minutes of a finale episode is another. The juxtaposition of these moments is unsettling, prompting viewers to question the motives of the storytellers they’re trusting to convey the lives of fictional teens. There was a sense that Tyler was happy and healthy after his time in treatment, a sensibility quickly muddled by Monty’s unimaginable cruelty, leading Tyler to retaliate against not only his perpetrators but the entire Liberty community. Was this all too much to take in? And was it fair to unravel his breakdown in just a few short minutes? Yes, “13 Reasons Why” does a fair job of presenting real-life teen issues to a loyal, interested audience. (According to Variety, the drama immediately took over the top spot among all U.S. digital original series following its release last Friday.) But it also fails to take full responsibility for those depictions, instead pointing viewers in the direction of a resource website, discussion guide and after-show with the cast. If more time had been spent on the emotional aftermath of Tyler’s rape, his storyline could have made a greater impact. Surely Netflix is using these new tools to try and make amends for the backlash that greeted the first season, but leaving their young fan base with even more unanswered questions about the correlation between extreme bullying and gun violence is not necessarily the way to go.

ARTS & CULTURE,"I’ll never forget the feeling the first time I put myself on display. The people, the lights, the extreme nervousness, but most of all I’ll never forget that first compliment about my painting. Throughout my life, I’ve had the privilege to shadow exceptionally brilliant artists who have extraordinary talent. Coming from a household of artists, I’ve always had a yearning to create, but I didn’t know what I was searching for. As a minority growing up in a low-income environment, I did not have as many opportunities or the exposure to understand what art truly means. Over time an idea developed inside me, an idea that you can express yourself through the stroke of a brush, through the capturing of an idea, a feeling, a moment in a medium ― be that paper, canvas, brick, or a computer screen. In that moment of epiphany my alter ego Bleu Pablo was born. Art has given me the ability to express who I am to the world. My paintings are an extension of myself and are my soul laid bare. To put a single feeling or expression to one piece is to say I am only one feeling or expression; they are as complex and varied as I am. I am my art, and my art is me. Articulating my feelings and thoughts through my art has given me the ability to express myself to the world in a way I never could with words. My goal is to create a platform, a safe space if you will, for emerging artists in the inner city to display their work. I want to give this generation and the ones to follow to have the opportunity to express themselves and empower each other through their work. Through sharing our cultures, experiences and ideas, we cultivate inspiration and grow a communal understanding of life in all its forms. I know it sounds corny, but I want us to create, innovate and motivate within ourselves and our peers. I owe my love of the arts to my creative family, especially my uncle Albert Wrighton who inspired me to give life to my canvas. When I first started and was unsure of my work he would tell me “Don’t stop. You will find yourself.” I feel I finally have done just that. Painting abstract art is my love ― as no other form allows you to draw love, happiness or despair as you see it. I describe my style as abstract with a touch of uptown sauce.

BUSINESS,"(Reuters) - An out-of-control sales culture, a defensive boss obsessed with stamping out negative views about her division and a group chief executive who called her “the best banker in America” were to blame for Wells Fargo & Co’s devastating sales scandal, an internal investigation found.The probe into how the San Francisco-based bank could have allowed abusive sales practices to fester for years at its branch network laid most of the blame on the former head of the retail division, Carrie Tolstedt, and some of her management team, in a report released to media on Monday.In the report, which was carried out by the bank’s chairman Stephan Sanger and three other independent directors, Tolstedt is blamed for ignoring the systemic nature of the problem which was pinned instead on individual wrongdoers and accused of obstructing the board’s efforts to get to the bottom of what was going on.John Stumpf, the CEO who retired under pressure from the scandal in October, was criticized for failing to grasp the gravity of the sales practice abuses and their impact on the bank.In the 110-page report, Stumpf was described as blinded by Wells Fargo’s cross-selling success. He refused to believe the model was seriously impaired and was full of admiration for Tolstedt, with whom he had a long working relationship. According to one director, Stumpf praised Tolstedt as the “best banker in America.”The report said Tolstedt hid the scale of the misconduct from the board, which only discovered that 5,300 staff had been fired for opening more than 2 million unauthorized accounts when the bank reached a $185 million settlement with regulators in September last year.On the advice of her lawyers, Tolstedt declined to be interviewed for the investigation.Lawyers for Tolstedt and Stumpf did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters on Monday morning.Wells Fargo said Tolstedt had been fired for cause and would be forfeiting her outstanding stock options with an approximate value of $47.3 million.Wells Fargo said it had decided to claw back approximately $28 million of Stumpf’s bonus, which was paid in March 2016.In total, the bank has fired five senior retail bank executives, including Tolstedt, over the scandal and has imposed forfeitures, clawbacks and compensation adjustments on senior leaders totaling more than $180 million, including $69 million from Stumpf and $67 million from Tolstedt.Since the scandal broke, the bank has seen a steady decline in the number of consumers opening checking and credit card accounts and has lost its status as America’s most valuable bank by market value. THE BOARDSanger, a board member since 2003, is under pressure to assure investors and regulators that he is rooting out the bank’s problems after a welter of criticism that the board did not do enough despite knowing about the problem since 2014.According to the report, multiple board members felt misled by a presentation by Tolstedt and others to the board’s risk committee in May 2015. The board members said they left thinking that between 200 and 300 employees had been fired for sales practice abuses and the problem was largely concentrated in southern California.Last week, influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services recommended investors vote to replace the majority of directors at Wells Fargo, including Sanger and the other three independent directors, at its April 25 annual meeting.The U.S. Justice Department, meanwhile, is investigating whether executives hid details from the company board and regulators as the problem grew over the years, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. U.S. Attorney offices in San Francisco and Charlotte, North Carolina, are investigating.The report criticized the board for not centralizing the risk functions at the bank earlier, not requesting more detailed reports from management and not insisting Stumpf get rid of Tolstedt sooner.Tim Sloan, who replaced Stumpf as CEO, is described in the report as having little contact with sales practices at the bank before becoming chief operating officer and Tolstedt’s boss in November 2015. Six months later he told her to step aside.Since the scandal broke, the bank has ended sales targets, changed pay incentives for branch staff, separated the role of chairman and CEO and hired new directors to its board. A NOTEWORTHY RISKA big part of Wells Fargo’s problem was its decentralized business model, which meant the retail bank was able to keep inquiries from head office at arm’s length and there was no joined-up effort by either the bank’s human resources or legal divisions to track and analyze the scale of the problem.As far back as 2002, Wells Fargo’s retail bank was taking steps to deal with sales practice violations and in 2004, a report by the bank’s Internal Investigations division recommended eliminating sales goals for employees.That report was sent to, among others, the chief auditor, a senior in-house employment lawyer, retail bank HR personnel and the head of sales & service development in the retail bank. No action was taken.Externally, Wells was lauded by investors for its ability to cross-sell individual customers multiple products and for its squeaky-clean reputation relative to peers following the financial crisis.Internally, the sales pressure was oppressive, particularly in California and Arizona, where senior bankers sometimes called subordinates several times a day to check in and chastise those who failed to meet sales objectives.A sales push, dubbed “Jump into January”, encouraged bankers to make lists of friends and family who were potential sales targets. Staff turnover usually increased that month.Sales practices were identified as a “noteworthy risk” to the board and its risk committee, of which Sanger was a member, after a series of stories in the Los Angeles Times detailed some of the sales practices.But Tolstedt was left to deal with the issue and was “notoriously resistant to outside intervention and oversight” the report said.Tolstedt was also perceived as having the support of Stumpf, who was seen not seen as someone to raise problems with.”Stumpf was ultimately responsible for enterprise risk management at Wells Fargo, but was not perceived within Wells Fargo as someone who wanted to hear bad news or deal with conflict.” (Reporting by Carmel Crimmins; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Meredith Mazzilli)"
ARTS & CULTURE,"For HuffPost’s #LoveTakesAction series, we’re telling stories of how people are standing up to hate and supporting those most threatened. What will you stand up for? Tell us with #LoveTakesAction. Anish Kapoor, Steve McQueen, Laurie Anderson, Ed Ruscha, Matthew Barney, Rosalind Krauss, Hank Willis Thomas, Catherine Opie and Yinka Shonibare are among the artists, writers, musicians and curators from around the world committed to using art as a mode of resistance. Over 200 international creatives have signed on to the global art coalition “Hands Off Our Revolution,” which implores artists of all media to channel the anger, sadness, hope and empathy ignited by present affairs into their work, providing viewers, readers and listeners with models of revolt and visions of a harmonious, peaceful future. The initiative came together in response to recent events ― including Brexit, President Donald Trump’s election and the ongoing refugee crisis. As artist Adam Broomberg explained to The Guardian, such instances of xenophobia and populism are interrelated, and artists must join forces to tackle the larger issue together. “What is important is that it is not just seen as America’s problem, or Europe’s problem,” he said, “so we are planning shows in Mexico and Lagos.”  The coalition pledges to host events and exhibitions around the world bringing contemporary politics into the spotlight, the first of which will be announced in March. This is the latest art world reaction to an uncertain political climate, following a recent artist petition against Trump’s immigration ban. While art certainly possesses the power to amplify marginalized voices and visualize alternate futures, many have argued that protests must extend beyond the insular echo chamber of museums and galleries to truly change minds or make a lasting impact on the lives of others.  “Hands Off” will hopefully find ways to reach past the confines of self-congratulatory, topical exhibitions to benefit those who are in need. So far, the platform seems promising, pledging to donate proceeds from upcoming shows and events to arts and activist causes building coalition. And who better to lead the impending revolution than those guided by creativity, empathy and curiosity?  As put by participating artist Yinka Shonibare: “We must all unite, regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation, to oppose all forms of bigotry. Populism must never be a guide to our conduct, empathy should be our guide. As artists we bear witness and we must never be silent or be silenced.” Read the full manifesto from “Hands Off” below: We are a global coalition affirming the radical nature of art. We believe that art can help counter the rising rhetoric of right-wing populism, fascism and the increasingly stark expressions of xenophobia, racism, sexism, homophobia and unapologetic intolerance. We know that freedom is never granted ― it is won. Justice is never given ― it is exacted. Both must be fought for and protected, yet their promise has seldom been so fragile, so close to slipping from our grasp, as at this moment. As artists, it is our job and our duty to reimagine and reinvent social relations threatened by right-wing populist rule. It is our responsibility to stand together in solidarity. We will not go quietly. It is our role and our opportunity, using our own particular forms, private and public spaces, to engage people in thinking together and debating ideas, with clarity, openness and resilience. “Hands Off” is far from the only creative response to Trump’s rhetoric and policies to emerge this week. The Davis Museum at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, for example, announced that it will be de-installing or shrouding all artwork by immigrants, as well as any art given to the museum by immigrants, to protest Trump’s executive order barring immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations and blocking Syrian refugees from entering the U.S.  The Museum of the City of New York has also voiced its opinion through art, staging an exhibition called “Muslim in New York” that pays tribute to the legacy of Muslim life throughout the city’s five boroughs.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Through his new project, Ai Weiwei aims to powerfully illustrate a humanitarian crisis.  The legendary Chinese artist, best known for his criticisms of the Chinese government, traveled across the globe, capturing the refugee crisis over the course of the year. The result is “Human Flow,” a documentary that features scenes from 23 countries, painting a picture of the experiences of those who have fleed their homes for a better life.  The film opens in New York and Los Angeles on Friday, on the heels of the artist’s New York City art installation “Good Fences Make Good Neighbors.” More significantly, the documentary is being released against the backdrop of a contentious travel ban limiting entry from several Muslim-majority countries, first introduced by President Donald Trump in January. In fact, Trump recently capped U.S. refugee resettlement at 45,000 ― an all-time low. In a way, Ai told HuffPost, his work is a message to the Trump administration.  “It’s about basic human rights. Defending our dignity, defending humanity,” Ai said. “The U.S. today has really come to the lowest credit in those issues ― admitting refugees in such a small and unacceptable number and also trying to push out people who have been here for a long time.” Ai’s documentary takes viewers through Greece, Iraq, and Malaysia, among a host of other countries, stressing the massive scale of the human migration. It’s shot during a time of “unprecedented” levels of displacement, with more than 65 million people forced from their homes, the UN refugee agency says.  The refugees are shown making dangerous trips at sea to Greece, others with their belongings strapped to their backs, trekking their way across Europe. More are seen in refugee camps, seemingly attempting to find a shred of normalcy. There are scenes at the U.S.–Mexico border, featuring an uncomfortable encounter with a border patrol guard. Ai makes appearances at some of the locations, often adding moments of levity.  “Human Flow” is also peppered with stunning bird’s-eye views of glistening bodies of water and other breathtaking landscapes. Then the camera zooms into the scenery to show dire situations ― people crammed in boats, trying to make it to shore, or refugees in camps searching for food, often waiting for hours. This contradiction shows that the crisis is completely manmade, Ai said.  “I wanted to put this human crisis in the most powerful, beautiful indifferent nature,” he said. “We don’t appreciate what’s given to human beings. We’d rather create this hatred or war or discrimination. ... The nature is very generous, very open to everybody. Humans create the most ugly fences.” Though the documentary tackles crises born out of unique circumstances, the poor treatment of minority communities is a common theme. And it’s one that hits home too.  People of color and immigrant communities have been used as scapegoats at various points in U.S. history and painted as national security or economic threats. In fact, during his campaign, Trump portrayed China as the “economic enemy,” which experts felt could be why hate crimes targeting the Asian-American community in Los Angeles County tripled in 2015. Ai has seen this time after time, he says. “It only shows the narrow understanding of politicians and the public [to think] that someone is stealing jobs,” He told HuffPost. “They need to focus on creating jobs. If the economy ... declines, they always blame someone else.” While Ai rose to fame for his outspoken statements on freedom of speech and the Chinese Communist Party, his focus on the refugee crisis isn’t part of some trend or fad, he insists to HuffPost. His activism is rooted in his experiences as a child, observing the way his father — famed poet Ai Qing — was punished and exiled for his work, he told HuffPost.  His defense of human rights extends across the globe, he says, much like the film.  “I always, always think of humanity, human rights [issues] as one. I’ve never separated it,” he told HuffPost. “People think I’m someone against the Communist Party ― Yes, I’m against totalitarian society, but more than that, I am a defender of human rights as a more general condition.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,"Days after President Donald Trump issued an executive order preventing refugees, immigrants and visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering America, protesters flooded international airports to voice their disapproval. Thousands of academics, including Nobel laureates, signed a petition opposing the ban. Celebrities such as Kerry Washington, Judd Apatow, Miley Cyrus and Seth Rogen voiced their thoughts on Twitter, many of them airing support for the ACLU, which sued the White House over the ban and achieved a stay on Saturday night. All of this coincides with President Trump’s unprecedentedly high disapproval rating, which spiked above 50 percent according to Monday’s Gallup poll.  Now, writers and publishers are chiming in, too. According to a post on The Guardian, a slew of best-selling authors have spoken out against the ban. And a British nonprofit publisher, Comma, took its criticism a step further. The press, which specializes in translated work, announced that it will only publish books by authors from the affected countries while the ban is in effect. “We’re heartened to see the wonderful demonstrations taking place at airports across the States over the weekend. But we’re sickened by this new side America, as a nation, is showing the world,” publisher Ra Page told The Huffington Post. “Personally, I’d much rather hear voices from Somalia, Yemen or Iran than have to listen to yet another news report about the new show business that is U.S. politics.”  Comma has an impressive backlist of titles by Muslim authors, authors whose work is translated from Arabic, and authors who are refugees. Perhaps their best-known writer is Hassan Blasim, whose short stories about war in Iraq were translated into English by Penguin Books. Covering his collection The Corpse Exhibition in 2014, HuffPost wrote, “Blasim’s stories give shape to an absurdist world in which brutal violence is commonplace.” Today, Blasim is unable to travel to the U.S. But, he said in a statement to HuffPost, he had no plans to visit the country after a 2014 trip, during which he felt treated “like a criminal or a terrorist although he had a visa and an invitation as a writer.” He’s one of many writers published by Comma facing these restrictions. His collection Iraq + 100: Stories from Another Iraq, the first-ever anthology of sci-fi set in Iraq, was published recently in the U.K., and will be published in the U.S. this year. One of its featured writers, Anoud, lives in New York currently, but questions whether she’ll be forced to return to her hometown, Mosul.  “She still doesn’t know where she stands as an Iraqi-born, British-raised writer based in New York,” Page said. “It’s not just writers of course, it’s thousands and thousands of ordinary, innocent people.” In solidarity with these writers – as well as the authors collected in Comma’s Sudanese anthology The Book of Khartoum – Page found the decision to “culturally boycott” America an easy choice to make. “There is a world beyond our friends in America, and we need to turn around and listen to it, give it a platform, hear its stories,” Page said. “Not just continually ‘other’ it.”"
BUSINESS,"A sixth woman has come forward to complain about sexual discrimination at Monster Energy, a male-dominated beverage company that appears to be plagued by a toxic work culture.  The woman, Karen Simmons, a 50-year-old former sales representative based in Alabama, spent nearly two years with Monster. She amassed a strong track record, even as she fended off one of her Atlanta-based managers, Ted Cook, who hit on her, made comments about her breasts, tried to get her drunk and invited her more than once for an “evening nightcap” in his hotel room on work trips, she told HuffPost.  Robert Duck, Simmons’ direct boss who works out of Monster’s office in Florida, also witnessed Cook’s behavior, but told her to brush it off, she said. “He said Ted was harmless, ‘a dirty old man,’” Simmons recalled.  Through a company spokesman, Duck said Simmons never complained. When reached by phone by HuffPost, he hung up. He did not respond to follow-up texts. Cook also did not respond to a call, text or LinkedIn message.  Simmons took her complaints no further. “What was I gonna say? I loved my job. I needed my job,” she said.  Simmons had worked for about 20 years in the beverage industry, a notoriously unfriendly business for women. “I knew saying things gets you retaliation.” What Simmons did not realize was that whether or not she spoke up, she was already trapped inside a company where the odds are stacked against women.   Last April, Simmons was fired for reasons she still doesn’t quite understand. Monster says it was for poor performance, according to a spokesman for the company. Simmons says her dismissal occurred a few months after receiving a generally positive performance review and just as she was poised to win an internal sales contest. In the fall, she filed sex and age discrimination charges against Monster at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Monster is also facing lawsuits from five other women over complaints of sexual discrimination and other issues, as first reported in a HuffPost investigation in January. One Monster executive, head of music marketing Brent Hamilton, is facing felony assault charges for allegedly strangling his girlfriend on a company business trip. He is still employed by the company. Another executive, John Kenneally, a vice president accused of sexually harassing two women at the company, resigned after HuffPost published details of the accusations in January. He ran the business unit that Simmons worked in. In public statements at the time, the company painted the women as disgruntled employees and said that the suits were unrelated.  “Monster Energy has zero-tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind,” the company said in January. “Monster takes all reported complaints very seriously. Any suggestions to the contrary are false.” Just as HuffPost was set to publish this story, Monster announced it was hiring a third party to review its human resource policies and procedures. The investigators will report straight to the company’s board of directors. “We are confident that the recent portrayal of the company in the media is not representative of [our] culture and practices,” Monster chairman and CEO Rodney Sacks and vice chair and president Hilton Schlosberg said in a statement. But they added that “in the context of the allegations made by the women bringing these lawsuits, we believe it is prudent.” The company declined to provide more details on the third party. “If there are areas where there are deficients, we will correct them,” Sacks and Schlosberg said. In a statement to HuffPost earlier in March, Monster said it wasn’t aware of Simmons’ complaints until recently.   “Ms. Simmons did not make any allegation of harassment to the company or to her manager while she was employed by the company,” the statement said. Monster only learned of the claim at a mediation session with Simmons and her lawyer in mid-February, the statement said. This was about three weeks after HuffPost published its investigation, the statement points out. Monster also said that Cook is no longer with the company. Simmons’ former boss Duck, who she said witnessed Cook’s behavior, is still working at Monster.   Through a spokesman, Monster also told HuffPost that Simmons’ account was “not accurate.” Simmons’ last employee evaluation included significant feedback about areas for improvement, the spokesman said. It was not positive. In response to other questions and requests for information, the spokesman wrote: “Many of the other allegations or questions are untrue, are missing facts or are irrelevant but we are not going to engage in a back and forth about this.”  After reading HuffPost’s reports, and looking into the cases filed against Monster, Simmons was shocked to learn that another female employee at the company, Page Zeringue, had gone to the human resources department to complain about Cook ― well before Simmons started working under him.  In a lawsuit against Monster, Zeringue alleges that her complaint to HR helped trigger her firing, ostensibly for bad performance. Meanwhile, Cook was sent to sexual harassment training, according to internal documents viewed by HuffPost. This was around the same time Simmons was hired.   Monster Energy markets its drinks primarily to men using cliched tropes about masculinity. Scantily clad Monster Girls in leather bikini tops serve as brand ambassadors. One beverage is actually called “Assault.” A few years ago, the company gave out Monster branded condoms as a promotional gimmick. That toxic male culture translates into policy where sexual harassment is not taken seriously. Monster’s employee guidelines ― reviewed by HuffPost  ― require that managers who observe sexual misconduct must report it. But in Simmons’ case, it appears that her direct boss, Duck, never informed HR about Cook’s conduct.   Even if HR learns about misbehavior, what passes for an investigation into sexual harassment complaints seems to amount to a surface questioning of the parties involved, where the accounts of men are weighed more seriously.   At Monster, terminations may be helped along by a confusing performance review process where managers are allowed to add damaging comments into evaluations, months after employees read their reviews, according to documents reviewed by HuffPost.  Even in an industry known for being heavily male, Monster stands out ― particularly in the sales division where Simmons worked.    Overall, only 13 percent of the company’s 505-person U.S. sales team are women. If you include administrative assistants, the percentage rises to 18 percent female, according to an internal employee directory from January obtained by HuffPost. None of the company’s 11 vice-presidents in sales are women.  Monster said some of the numbers HuffPost obtained were incorrect, but declined to offer specifics or provide its own data. In an earlier statement to HuffPost the company said “many women hold top leadership positions within Monster,” and pointed to its chief commercialization officer, Emelie Tirre. Still, sales is so male-dominated at Monster that at a 2016 national sales meeting in Las Vegas ― even with human resource representatives in attendance ― a vice-president told a blatantly misogynistic joke to a packed room, according to three separate accounts from current and former employees.  The joke goes like this: There is an old bull and a young bull on a hill, overlooking a field of cows. Young bull says to the old bull: “Let’s run down there and fuck a cow.” Old bull says, nah: “Let’s walk down there and fuck them all.” It was meant to inspire. Simmons recalls being appalled. But she was used to hearing sexist talk from male colleagues. After all, she had spent most of her career in beverage sales, a notoriously sexist culture. She knew how to handle herself.  Over the past three years, at least four other women in the east division, where Simmons worked, were fired or pushed out. They include Simmons, two other women who are suing the company for sex discrimination, and one who declined to speak on the record with HuffPost but has since quit. As of January 2018, there were only 16 women out of 153 employees working in the east division. Simmons was often the only woman at the dinners and events where she would meet up with Cook and Duck. Given the company’s cultural penchant for partying, drinking alcohol at these meet-ups was a given.  She didn’t drink, and repeatedly rebuffed Cook’s efforts to “get her drunk,” she said. She declined his invitations for a “nightcap” in his hotel room.  “The more Ted drank, the more handsy he got,” Simmons told HuffPost. On one occasion when he asked for a hug, Simmons said she uncomfortably gave him a half-hug. He wasn’t satisfied, and pulled her in for a do-over, she said. “He said, ’I felt that,” Simmons said, meaning he could feel the pressure of her breasts on his chest.   Arguably, Simmons should never have had to deal with Cook in the first place. Two years earlier Zeringue had filed her complaint about him with the human resources department, according to the lawsuit she filed last year against the company. Huffpost obtained Zeringue’s original complaint to HR. In it she said Cook had a reputation for getting grabby when he drinks, and was known as “Touchy Ted” around the office. She detailed an incident where he talked to her about her breasts and those of a coworker; he also pulled the hugging-close move on her, she said. The HR department reached out to Cook’s boss, Kenneally, the executive who recently resigned in the face of harassment allegations after HuffPost’s investigation published. Kenneally defended Cook, telling the HR representative he had already spoken with him about the incident and there were “no noted recurrences,” according to a review of an internal HR report obtained by HuffPost. Kenneally also made a point of criticizing Zeringue. Her “performance is not where it needs to be,” he is quoted as saying.  When Cook was confronted by HR, he confessed and said “he learned his lesson,” according to internal notes. He also conceded that “touchy Ted” was one of the nicknames he was known by inside the company, another being “Uncle Ted.” He was assigned to sexual harassment training, called “stop sexual harassment training for supervisors,” and given a warning. It’s unclear if HR ever planned any kind of followup to make sure he stayed on track. Zeringue was fired a month later. In her complaint against Monster she claims her firing amounted to retaliation for speaking up. That suit is now headed to private arbitration ― outside the public court system. It was around this time, at a dinner in New Orleans that Simmons attended with Cook, Duck and several other male Monster employees that she said she heard them joking about “having to go to HR classes,” if they misbehaved. “It was just like a big joke,” Simmons said Simmons’ last few months at Monster played out like a corporate gaslighting.  In February 2017, less than two months after she had received a decent performance review from Duck, he asked to meet up with her in Florida where they had both traveled for business.  What happened next came as a total shock. Duck showed her a disciplinary write-up.  “For stuff I didn’t do,” Simmons said. The writeup ― which HuffPost has reviewed ―  claimed she was unwilling to leave her hometown for work. Yet, she was in Florida on a business trip at the time she was given the writeup. “I was out of town every week,” she said. The writeup also claims that Duck spoke with Simmons in January about these issues. Simmons said the only feedback she got that month came when she downloaded her performance review from the company’s internal website. Monster provided HuffPost with a copy of the document. Dated Dec. 31, the review judges Simmons’ performance as “Meets Standards,” giving her a 2.14 rating out of 4, and was generally upbeat and positive but is peppered with constructive criticism.  “At this point the only thing I can ask Karen to improve on is slowing down,” Duck wrote. “She also needs a little more work on time management.”  He called her a “great problem solver,” who sometimes needs help prioritizing, “I have asked her to make sure when she schedules a meeting...to ALWAYS make sure she can do it…” In the category of “job knowledge and skill,” Duck gave Simmons a rating of 3 or “exceeds expectations.” So the negative writeup baffled Simmons.  She cried.  “Where is this coming from?” she asked him. She wanted to understand what she did wrong, so she could fix things. He refused to provide more details. “He said I was making things worse and to go home and forget about it,” Simmons said. For about a month-and-a-half after that, Duck, still Simmons’ direct supervisor, did not talk to Simmons. She said he wouldn’t respond to texts or calls. One thing he apparently did do: update Simmons’ Dec. 31 performance review ― topping the document off with an extremely harsh “summary paragraph” slamming her for poor performance.  The added paragraph is dated March 3, 2017. The tone of this text is vastly different from the rest of the document. “At this point, Karen has lost the trust of some of her bottlers and needs to ‘fix’ this soon or she will struggle,” Duck wrote. “Karen acts disconnected in meetings and face to face with her Coke partners.” Duck used gender-coded words like “abrasive” and “demanding” to describe her demeanor with outside contacts at Coca-Cola bottlers Simmons worked with. The final comment was meant to assess Simmons’ work from the end of December through March, a Monster spokesman told HuffPost. “The final comments reflect not only her manager’s assessment of her work through 12/31/17,” he said. “But the final comment on 03/03/17 was also influenced by her performance in the months after 12/31/17 and before the final comment.” Simmons said she had not seen this paragraph until she was asked about it by HuffPost.  Monster, which provided HuffPost with the review, claimed that Simmons had likely seen the additional paragraph. However, Monster could not provide evidence that she did. According to Monster’s records, Simmons signed her review on March 1 ― two days before Duck signed off on the harsh additional paragraph.  Finally, in late April, Duck broke the silence. He called Simmons and said he needed to meet in person. But when he met her in a hotel lobby in her hometown of Daphne, Alabama, he was there with Cook and they had an HR representative on the phone to talk to her.  She was fired. “It was like somebody just punched me in the stomach,” Simmons said. She cried and begged, she said, telling them she needed the insurance and that her family would suffer. She was offered two weeks severance ― if she signed a document promising not to sue. “I didn’t sign. I just think it was wrong. It was totally wrong,” she said. “Two weeks pay for what they did is wrong.” Zeringue  ― the woman who had complained about Cook years earlier ― also was offered two weeks severance when she was fired. She declined, too. Interestingly, Cook retired less than a month later. It’s unclear why. His colleagues threw him a going away party.  And just a few months later, during Christmas time in 2017, Cook returned to Monster’s Atlanta office dressed up as Santa Claus. Young women at the office sat in his lap and posed for pictures. One woman posted a shot on Facebook captioned #UncleTed.  Simmons, meanwhile, took her dismissal hard. She was so embarrassed about being fired that she stopped leaving her home during the day, not wanting anyone in her small Alabama hometown to ask her why she wasn’t working. “The first six months were awful,” she said. “If I needed to go out, I’d go at three or four in the morning or ten or 11 at night.” Because she lost her job, Simmons’ husband, a 68-year-old who supervises utility crews in Tampa, has had to put off his retirement. He had relocated to Tampa temporarily to make a little extra cash before finishing his career. Now it’s unclear when he can come home.   “This has affected my marriage, my life. It’s been really tough on my family,” she said, breaking down in tears. Simmons is responsible for paying college tuition for her 21-year-old daughter. “My daughter worries all the time. I told her don’t worry about it; we’ll figure a way around it.” Do you have a story to tell about sexual harassment or discrimination at Monster or another workplace? Email: emily.peck@huffpost.com"
BUSINESS,"By Adam Mendler I often tell people that despite going to business school for six years, the best learning experiences have come from the school of hard knocks. There are few aspects of entrepreneurship more vital — and in the eyes of many, more difficult — than building the right team. When we launched our company in 2012, we understood the connection between a great corporate culture and attracting top talent, and successfully established a company deeply grounded in our values. Our environment is unquestionably unique. We prefer shorts and flip-flops to suits and ties. We foster an atmosphere intended to empower each person in our organization to thrive free of bureaucratic shackles, and we have a lot of fun in the office. However, our dedication to corporate culture was recently put to the test and we failed. But we learned from our experience, and every entrepreneur, hiring manager and human resource professional can too. We were filling an entry-level position, and to our great excitement, we received an application from a seemingly incredible candidate. She had a high GPA, a strong resume, and a degree from an elite institution. We immediately moved her to the front of the line and quickly brought her in for an interview. In the interview, I was impressed with her intellectual capacity, but was concerned about her soft skills and ability to fit seamlessly into our culture. While I normally trust my gut, I didn’t want my gut alone out to get in the way of our hiring a potentially extraordinary candidate. Rather than nix her on the basis of my concerns about her cultural fit, I asked two members of our team to interview her before making a final decision. Both were strongly supportive of her hiring, emphasizing the value of adding a person of her intellect and potential. And so we did. She didn’t turn out to be the right fit for the role or the company. After one week, I gave her a very blunt performance review, highlighting the numerous areas of concern. After two weeks, we let her go.  In spite of our efforts creating a defining corporate culture, we lost sight of the importance of protecting that culture. This experience illustrated the adverse consequences of overvaluing credentials and overlooking the characteristics that are better predictors of whether or not a candidate will thrive in your organization. Having hired many people from all kinds of schools, including all of the top universities in the country over the years, I can confidently say that academic background is one variable that should be considered, but not at the top of the list. Instead, I focus our hiring on finding people who possess an Ivy League-caliber attitude, fit seamlessly into our culture and are willing to do whatever it takes to get things done. This experience led us to change our hiring policies, as we were reminded of the need to focus on culture over credentials. We instituted a rule establishing that if at any point in the interview process any member of our team feels that a potential hire may not fit seamlessly into our office environment, we eliminate them from consideration. We nixed numerous students with otherwise sterling credentials who applied to our summer internship program for this reason. Company-wide, we recognized the importance of de-emphasizing “pedigree” and re-emphasizing work ethic and cultural fit. The best way to maintain a strong company culture is by staying true to it and living the underlying values, not only when it is easy, but when it is difficult. One might argue that our culture is strengthened by our barbecues, by our popcorn and snow cone machines and by our love of joking around with each other. I believe our culture is strengthened with each new team member who truly reflects our values. I strongly encourage anyone and everyone to recognize that no person — no matter how strong they may look on paper or how tempting it may be to slot them into a particular opening — is more important than your values. The next time you are considering a new hire, ask yourself and your team members whether or not that person will enhance or detract from your environment. Trust your gut and understand what really matters and why. ― CEO of The Veloz Group. Founder of Beverly Hills Chairs, Custom Tobacco and Veloz Solutions. USC / UCLA alum. LA native.

BUSINESS,"Two days ago, libertarian-leaning Forbes blogger Tim Worstall published a post titled “Hurricane Harvey Is When We Need Price Gouging, Not Laws Against It.” I would link to the story, but Forbes seems to have pulled it after the post received tremendous blowback from people who were outraged by Worstall’s pro-price-gauging post. Luckily, because mistakes live forever on the internet, you can read a cache of the article. Worstall explains why he thinks businesses should be able to raise prices on goods and services when disaster strikes. He suggests that when prices go up during a disaster, the people who need the goods and services the most will get them because they’ll be most willing to pay the inflated prices. And the high prices will encourage others to deliver goods and services to the region in the most efficient manner possible, so they can get a cut of those giant profits. He writes: So these images of a Houston Best Buy selling water for exorbitant sums of money is the kind of “efficient” solution Worstall believes the market provides during a disaster: So a @BestBuy in Houston is price gouging water during this rescue. Holy crap, BB, what is WRONG with you? pic.twitter.com/R0spS04wFw What Worstall doesn’t address, though, is what happens when someone simply can’t afford that high price of bottled water? An economics wonk who blogs at the Big Picture under the name Invictus asked Worstall just that question on Twitter: An infant's life is at risk due to gouging on what is usually affordable formula and/or medicine. Should the infant die, Tim? Yes or no. https://t.co/jYa86qmuye Invictus repeatedly asked Worstall the question, and Worstall struggled mightily to parse his way out of it. At one point, he claimed that “We’re not arguing about whether supplies should be provided. We’re arguing about how.” Finally, the Forbes blogger refused to respond: I'm old enough to recognise questions of the have you stopped beating your wife kind. Not playing. In other words, Worstall prefers his arguments to remain academic. This is how libertarians and trickle-downers like their economics: without any real-world consequences. If they keep the situation broadly rhetorical and they refuse to address the real-world consequences of their policies, they can continue to ‘win’ arguments using trickery and pedantry. But here’s the thing: People on the ground in Houston are right now living in the academic thought experiment that Worstall and others are bloviating on about. Prices are being gouged on food and water and gas and hotels. And not everyone can afford those prices. What would Worstall have hungry and thirsty poor people do? He refuses to say. So let’s consider the real-world options that people are left with in Houston right now: These are the options. This is a life-or-death situation, and the free market simply can’t provide solutions for everyone. (As I’ve argued in the past, the free market doesn’t care if you live or die.) But trickle-down pundits like Tim Worstall have devoted their lives to arguing that the free market is a godlike, omniscient force that always provides the best outcomes. So rather than revise their arguments, or acknowledge that sometimes the free market fails, they simply plug their fingers in their ears and ignore the suffering of their fellow human beings. Even in cases like this — when tens of thousands of Americans are rising to the occasion and helping their fellow citizens because they know it is the right thing to do — zealots like Worstall simply can’t refute the profit motive. And yet they also refuse to accept the inhumanity of their own arguments. So they have to do what hundreds of thousands of Texans are doing right now: they hunker down in the dark and wait for the storm to pass.

ARTS & CULTURE,"The Ancient Greeks had a winning formula. During performances of their tragedies, acts of excessive violence and gore had to take place offstage and out of the audience's sight. Later, the actors would describe events too horrible to imagine. How does one describe a gruesome cyclops or monsters devouring helpless sailors? One might start with the words ""Oh horror, horror, horror!"" After all, when push comes to shove it's all about telling a story, spinning a yarn, capturing an audience's attention and keeping them hooked on a narrative. As new technologies have helped filmmakers concoct ever more ingenious special effects, audiences have progressed way beyond the kludgy kind of stop-motion animation used in 1925's The Lost World, 1953's The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms and 1955's It Came From Beneath The Sea. No more can filmmakers rely on the man-in-a-rubber-suit device (1954's Godzilla and Creature from the Black Lagoon). Steady advances in CGI technology allow today's filmmakers to go for increasingly ridiculous scripts. Two classic examples of such wretched excess are 2009's Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus and 2014's version of Godzilla. At some point, however, an audience is going to want more than just cheap visual gags. They're going to want suspense, terror and masterful storytelling. In 2006, South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-Ho  delivered all three, giving audiences the thrills they had craved with The Host. How does one tell a contemporary horror story if one's audience can't see the monster? What if the audience is gathered in a 50-seat theatre with no possibility of elaborate scenic effects? How does a playwright scare the shit out of them? * * * * * * * * * * A recent headline that grabbed the attention of Bay area readers stated that the Military Once Used SF Fog For Simulated Germ-Warfare Attack, Exposing 800,000 To Harmful Bacteria. In his book, Clouds of Secrecy, Leonard A. Cole (Director of the Terror Medicine and Security Program at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School) described the trials as using ""harmless bacteria"" while admitting that it was one of the largest human experiments ever conducted. According to reports, during the 1950s the United States Armed Forces used San Francisco's coastal fog belt as ""a means of masking the spread of a biological agent in simulated germ-warfare attacks. Nearly all of San Francisco received 500 particle minutes per liter. In other words, nearly every one of the 800,000 people in San Francisco exposed to the cloud at normal breathing rate (10 liters per minute) inhaled 5,000 or more particles per minute during the several hours that they remained airborne."" One's awareness of these tests adds an extra wallop of verisimilitude to a provocative new play, I Saw It, which was recently staged by Wily West Productions at the EXIT Studio. With Jennifer Lynne Roberts acting as head writer, most of the hard-hitting monologues/soliloquies in this 75-minute drama were written by Laylah Muran de Assereto. Tensely directed by Ariel Craft, I Saw It featured a Greek chorus of frantic Bay area Twitterati posting hysterical tweets that include pleas for help and such panicky messages as ""#End of Days""  Samantha Behr is Isla in I Saw It (Photo by: Colin Hussey)   Colleen Egan is Nola in I Saw It (Photo by: Colin Hussey)  Kyle McReddie is David in I Saw It (Photo by:Colin Hussey)   Genevieve Perdue is Diana in I Saw It (Photo by: Colin Hussey) I Saw It deftly demonstrates what can happen when the ""monster attacking a city"" bears no resemblance to a prehistoric dinosaur or a radioactive mutant creature, but results from the dissemination of a carefully engineered hallucinogen which can alter a person's preferences and behaviors in the way a hacker might attack a software program's source code. On a good day, the lab-engineered biochemical can trigger a person's innermost fears, lack of self-esteem or bravado. On a bad day..... oh, well, you know how some people act under stress!  Katrina Kroetch and Richard Wenzel are two of the
Bay Area's Twitterati in I Saw It (Photo by: Colin Hussey)  I was especially impressed by Genevieve Perdue's portrayal of the amoral Diana, Colleen Egan's resentful Nola and Samantha Behr's ""take-no-prisoners"" characterization of Isla.

BUSINESS,"A version of this article originally appeared on Gen[FKD]. Sign up for my newsletter to get my articles straight to your inbox. Most of us spend nearly nine hours a day engaged in media, technology or communications, but just a fraction of that time is spent talking on the phone. A 2014 Telegraph article reports that the number of landline calls has fallen by 38 percent since 2007. Meanwhile, even the average length of a cellphone call has dropped from 2.38 minutes in 1993 to 1.8 in 2012. Many of us view phone calls as distracting, superfluous and presumptuous, which is partly why phone communication is largely excluded from millennial career advice. We prefer email. But, in a few cases, they're still essential, superior modes of communication. Here are five times to get on the phone: If it's going to be awkward.
One Forbes article advocated email over phone conversation because there are no awkward silences or pauses in emails. But this awkwardness is exactly why we need phones. Silence is a form of listening, empathy, respect and expression. It's also a way of communicating: we receive valuable information from pauses. Conversations that may be awkward on the phone are more likely to be offensive, misunderstood or even incomprehensible by email. Because awkward phone calls can sometimes turn into catastrophic email exchanges, it's better to bite the bullet and bear the discomfort. If you want to build a relationship.
Phone calls humanize work communication in a way that email can't. Spoken words spark collaboration and laughter. We build relationships not by exchanging information but by feeling like we're together. Moreover, tone and context are easily misread in email, which can lead to unnecessary conflict and damage existing or potential relationships. ""It is hard to get the EQ (emotional intelligence) right in email,"" explains Anthony Tjan for Harvard Business Review. When you've scheduled it.
Calling someone out of the blue can feel confrontational and needy unless you have regular dialogue. In the age of email and calendar invites, there's nearly no reason to call someone without scheduling it first. This is both a courtesy and a productivity trick: by scheduling when the call will happen and how long it will last, you're more likely to stick to the agenda and allocated time. If you're negotiating.
When you're thinking about whether to call or send an email, ask, ""Is this a negotiation or a notification?"" Whenever you don't want something in writing or you're still talking terms or discussing, phone calls can sort out interests and information without setting anything in stone prematurely. On the other hand, if you're simply trying to share information as an FYI, the receiver would likely appreciate not getting a phone call. There's nothing to converse about; an emailed heads up would be better. There's a distinction between sharing data, where one person talks at the other and conversation ""where there's a coming together and more of an exchange,"" Dr. Richard Graham told The Telegraph. If it's time to close a loop.
Email gives people an opportunity to research and consider what's on the table. Phone calls, by contrast, require thinking and responding quickly and spontaneously, which can make them stressful or inadequate when we want to weigh our options and take time to respond. But, for this same reason, calls can also be a great way to close the loop. If an existing email exchange is persistently unclear or unsettled, a phone call can politely put people on the spot and get a definitive answer. In short, phone calls can remove a digital bottleneck and tie up an exchange so we can move on or forward. Takeaway
Fundamentally, how we communicate depends on what we're exchanging. If you're exchanging cut and dry information, email often suffices. If you're exchanging thoughts, ideas, opinions or potential terms for negotiation, a phone call may be warranted. Today, we have infinite ways of communicating information. Matching the right medium with the right topic can save us time and start more meaningful working relationships.

ARTS & CULTURE,"They filed in, one by one, a long line of fourth- and fifth-grade students, quiet and well-behaved until they crossed the threshold of the Asia Society gallery. And then, one by one, they gasped, cried out, and-- in the case of one young boy-- jumped and nearly fell on landing. ""Oh, man!"" said one of the students. ""Check out my robot!"" A months-long project culminated May 19 when children from four New York City public schools saw their own work on the walls and the gallery floors of a major cultural institution. Each fall, Asia Society invites students and teachers to a major exhibition at the museum, then works in partnership with Studio in a School to help the students craft their own art inspired by the show. This year marked the 22nd year of the program, and the original exhibition featured the work of technology-obsessed contemporary Korean American artist Nam June Paik, whose work with robots and televisions starting in the 1960s and 1970s presaged many social and technological advances of the 21st century. The students from P.S. 297 in Brooklyn, P.S. 75 in Manhattan, and P.S. 87 and P.S. 182 in the Bronx used materials and concepts that the late Korean American artist would have recognized to create robotic suit jackets; a ""pet"" made from the chassis of a vacuum cleaner; a tree showing the evolution of the telephone; and other imaginative works. ""I'm famous,"" said one young boy as adults snapped photos of him and the robot he had helped design. Among those on hand for the opening was Agnes Gund, President Emerita of the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), long-time arts patron and founder and chair of Studio in a School. In the Asia Society auditorium prior to the gallery tour, Gund congratulated ""these brilliant young artists"" for their creativity and skill. She praised the ""thoughtful collaboration"" among Studio in a School, the schools' teachers and principals, and Asia Society, and gave special thanks to Nancy Blume, head of arts education at Asia Society. Gund singled out the piece Baby from the series Robot Family Sculptures, the creation of five boys from P.S. 75 in Manhattan. The piece was built with, among other materials, a basketball for a body, a videocamera lens hood for its mouth and energy-efficient light bulbs for hands. ""I think it's a terrific work of art,"" Gund said, ""and I happen to have an interest in basketball."" She explained, to laughter from the students, that she was a fan of the Cleveland Cavaliers and had watched their win over the Atlanta Hawks the previous night. ""We fought a lot about how to make it great,"" said Isaac, one of the students who designed Baby. ""I think Mr. Nam June Paik would have liked it."" Just a few feet away from Baby lay Dog, also part of the Robot Family Sculptures series and a creation of Chloe and Stephanie from P.S. 75 in Manhattan. This piece, it turns out, had been inspired by something missing from Asia Society's Nam June Paik show. ""There were robot moms and dads but no pets, no animals,"" Chloe said. ""So this is kind of based on his art, but kind of our own idea, too."" The students' art will be on display at Asia Society Museum until July 19 in an exhibition titled Inspired by Nam June Paik: Becoming Robot. The show and this partnership with Studio in a School is one of the coolest things we do, and just as much a part of our mission as the visits of Asian leaders to our stage. The idea behind both is the same -- building bridges of understanding between the people of Asia and the U.S. ""You are the youngest artists to exhibit at the Asia Society Museum,"" Peggy Loar, Asia Society's Interim Museum Director, told the children. ""And this is a museum where some of the artists were born three thousand years ago."" Loar spoke of the power of a young person's creativity and working as a team. Before the children left, she invited them to return with their families and receive free admission to see the exhibition and share their accomplishments with their loved ones. ""Just come in,"" she said, ""and say you are one of the artists featured in Inspired by Nam June Paik."""
ENTERTAINMENT,"The ongoing Fox News sexual harassment scandal is getting the Hollywood treatment, and one big casting detail has surfaced. Charlize Theron is set to play former Fox News host Megyn Kelly in a film about the network’s late CEO, Roger Ailes, The Hollywood Reporter exclusively reported on Monday. According to Deadline, the untitled film centers around the women at the network who worked there during Ailes’ tenure.  Ailes, who is responsible for building the powerhouse conservative news network and its many stars, resigned in July 2016 after mounting accusations of sexual harassment, most notably by former host Gretchen Carlson. Even after his departure, Ailes cost the network millions of dollars in legal fees related to the flurry of lawsuits filed against the former CEO. Carlson, who previously hosted Fox News’ morning show “Fox & Friends,” settled her lawsuit for a reported $20 million. Ailes died one year ago at age 77, about nine months after his resignation. Kelly, one of the network’s biggest stars, left Fox News for NBC News in January 2017. In her memoir published in late 2016, she accused Ailes of sexually harassing her when she was at the network. After her departure, she blasted the network from her perch at NBC News, telling audiences that she complained to network executives about host Bill O’Reilly, who was fired from Fox News after an explosive New York Times report detailed claims by five women who said the host sexually harassed or acted improperly toward them. The film does not have a release date yet, but Deadline reported that it has been in the works since before Ailes’ death last year. While Theron is set to play Kelly, future audiences will be left to wonder who will take on Carlson’s role."

From left to right, Kirsten Quinn (Lisa Morrison) and co-star Renee Weisband (Ruth Steiner). Photo by Kristine DiGrigoli An innocent meeting between mentor and student soon evolves into something quite adversarial. As time goes on (six years to be exact), two women go from teacher to student to friends to equals and finally rivals, as the unthinkable happens and a huge betrayal occurs. Written by Donald Margulies and produced by Isis Productions, Collected Stories
is about the shifting relationship between two writers, Ruth Steiner, an established and renowned short story writer and professor, and Lisa Morrison, a naive acolyte who worships Ruth and wants to be a writer herself.  ""I think it will appeal greatly to teachers, students and anyone in the field of academia in general and in the field of writing more specifically,"" Kirsten Quinn, one of the actresses in the forthcoming play, said.  ""It is an intimate, two person play as well, which has a totally different feel from other Isis Productions like the raucous, farcical Accomplice.""  Quinn, a professor at the Community College of Philadelphia, got into acting when she attended college at La Salle University. One of her teachers, Helena White, urged her to audition for A Midsummer Night's Dream.  Once she did the show, she was hooked. Quinn then went on to get her M.F.A. in acting at the University of Pittsburgh in 1999, and has been acting professionally ever since, while branching out into teaching as well.  ""The dialogue is spectacular and rich, and because there are only two characters, the arcs and characters are far more nuanced and developed,"" Quinn said. ""This is a realistic drama which has many strong themes....accountability, hero-worship, professional integrity, friendship, ""mother/ daughter"" relationships, arrested development, inability to move away from the past, establishing and destroying boundaries, and of course, artistic freedom."" Quinn's character is Lisa Morrison, the graduate creative writing student who worships her mentor, Ruth Steiner. Lisa is a troubled but incredibly earnest woman, who wants nothing more than approval and validation. She has the talent and ambition to become a famous author herself, but there are many times when she goes too far, blurring the lines between what is permissible and what isn't.  Insecure, needy and even ditsy at first, Lisa transforms as the play goes on. ""She is a very interesting character because she does nothing to hurt Ruth intentionally, yet she does hurt her very deeply anyway,"" Quinn said. ""She is not a devious or manipulative person but at the same time, she should know what is right and what isn't. She just doesn't have understanding of boundaries that would be required to do that. Being a part of Ruth Steiner's life is a huge uphill battle for Lisa, since it seems that no matter what she does, Lisa is unable to win Ruth over completely."" As a theater goer herself, Quinn enjoys feeling like a fly on the wall when watching a production. Collected Stories is that type of play for an audience, she added. ""This is a play about relationship, but it is also about the shared language of these two strong and very different female protagonists,"" Quinn said.  ""It is a great and rare opportunity to see a two woman show with really astute observations about the human condition and what it means to be an artist/ writer.""

BUSINESS,"Social media gets lots of press, but social commerce has been pretty much ignored. Why is that — and why does it matter in the world that connected people to products? Let’s start with a definition. Social commerce is simply the ability to buy things from a third-party company within a social media context — buying from friend recommendations. For example, you can check out products on a Facebook post and then complete the transaction rather than having to go to the company’s site to buy what you want. Today two sites own the social commerce space: Facebook and Pinterest. Twitter has come and gone — for now. But that’s just the beginning. Last year, PwC conducted a global survey of nearly 23,000 people and found that 78% of consumers are influenced by social media when shopping online. The chart above shows above how social media is affecting online shopping actions. Facebook: With a Facebook store, you can upload products and product information, customize your shop’s product offerings, sell directly from your page, manage orders, run a Facebook ad to promote one of your products and get insights. Which is to say, you can create an end-to-end commerce experience with advertising, customer feedback, and fulfillment. Pinterest: Pinterest released buyable pins in June 2015. You can select “Buy It” and make a purchase right then and there with either Apple Pay or credit card. Then Pinterest added a feature called “Shop the Look” that allows users to click on photos to buy one item, and then check out similar items that are also for sale. Pinterest has worked with a number of major retailers including Macy’s, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale’s, and Wayfair. Heidi Cohen of Actionable Marketing Guide told ConversionXL: “While shopping is essentially a social experience — think girls shopping at the local mall — online shopping is distinctly not social. Yet, regardless of where the purchase is made, many shopping decisions involve more than one individual’s input, be it a couple, parent and child, or friends.” Shopping is a social experience. You buy things for other people. You buy things to enhance your personal style. You reach out to friends to say: “How does this look on me?” According to Marketing Week, the “social commerce boom” is being fueled by young mobile consumers. Thirty-three percent of 18- to 24-year-olds say they would purchase items directly on Facebook, 27 percent on Instagram and 20 percent on Twitter. For 25- to 34-year-olds, the numbers decrease a bit: 30 percent on Facebook. For 54- to 65-years-olds, it’s 10 percent. Here’s what we know for sure: social commerce is a nascent market. It encompasses a bunch of different experiences including friend endorsements, social shopping and group buying. Using your social graph to gain wisdom, feedback, and endorsements is a powerful and growing trend. As consumers become more comfortable using their phones to be both be the center of social life, and the center of commerce discovery and purchase life, that powerful and almost inevitable convergence will change shopping forever."
ENTERTAINMENT,"The rapper T.I. was arrested on Wednesday morning in Georgia and charged with disorderly conduct and public drunkenness. The Henry County Police Department told local news Channel 2 that the 37-year-old, whose legal name is Clifford Harris Jr., was arrested around 4 a.m. He had arrived at the gated community where he resides but didn’t have his key, according to police. They said the “Whatever You Like” singer demanded the guard let him in and asked, “Don’t you know who I am?” Ch2 was the 1st to confirm the breaking news about TI - Clifford Harris - arrested this morning. I just got my hands on the mugshot. Police charged him w/disorderly conduct & public drunkenness after an argument w/gate guard at his country club residence pic.twitter.com/hDIxrd0KcX Law enforcement sources told TMZ that T.I. was “allowed into his gated community after an initial argument with the guard, but then returned on foot shortly afterward to confront the guy again.”  T.I. then reportedly called a friend who joined him to argue with the guard, which led to the police being called. The friend, who police said had a warrant out on him, was also arrested. T.I. has since been released."
BUSINESS,"We’re just a few days away from the 89th Academy Awards, an evening in which years of hard work culminate in dreams coming true. Many would agree it’s quite moving to watch the acceptance speeches from those who take home OscarsⓇ. Through their words, we often have the opportunity to get to know the events that inspired the creation of a film or character, as well as the individuals who contributed to its development along the way.  Previously, we spoke about the importance of diversity in bringing stories to life. It’s this same diversity in storytelling that brings awareness to personal triumph, struggles individuals face daily, and problems plaguing our society. However, storytelling at its best can also inspire action. It can help uncover a new desire to solve these same problems and, in turn, help people realize a purpose that lives inside of them. At PwC, we constantly seek opportunities to help people find and live their purpose. So, come Sunday, while celebrities and studio heads are walking the red carpet, PwC will be hosting a red carpet event of its own. Only, instead of asking individuals what they’re wearing, we’ll be asking them to tell us more about their purpose―their reason for being. Joining us for our live event, hosted by Shannon Schuyler, PwC’s Chief Purpose Officer, and Jo Confino, Executive Editor, Impact and Innovation, Huffington Post, will be names many may know, including: We admire greatly those individuals who use their platform to help enable change in ways that are personal to them, and we celebrate those individuals who create new platforms from the ground up, simply through their inner will to make a difference in their communities. That is why we’re also privileged to welcome these social entrepreneurs and educators who redefine what it means to turn the work they do for a living into the work that can be done for our world: Our Red Carpet with a Purpose will stream live on The Huffington Post Sunday, February 26 at 4 pm Pacific. Amidst a night filled with stars and glamour, we hope you’ll join us to take a moment to reflect on your passions and purpose, and the mark you want to leave in this world.  ©2017 PwC.

BUSINESS,"After five days of deliberations, jurors have found Martin Shkreli guilty on three charges of fraud and not guilty on five charges. Shkreli faces jail time, though legal experts say he’ll likely receive far less than the maximum 20-year sentence he would have faced had he been found guilty of all eight counts of securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He will be sentenced at a later date. Shkreli spoke after receiving the verdict from the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, saying, “We have some work to do” on the three guilty verdicts. “This was a witch hunt of epic proportions and maybe they found one or two broomsticks,” Shkreli told reporters. ""Pharma Bro"" Shkreli after trial: ""This was a witch hunt of epic proportions, maybe they found 1 or 2 broomsticks"" https://t.co/E2f3jnPt0N Prosecutors maintained the 34-year-old defrauded investors at two hedge funds he used to run, MSMB Capital Management and MSMB Healthcare, from October 2009 to March 2014. After lying to them about the state of their investments, prosecutors say, Shkreli siphoned off millions of dollars from a pharmaceutical company named Retrophin, where he was CEO, to cover his debts. In the case of MSMB Capital Management, for instance, Shkreli claimed to have made returns of 35.77 percent since its inception, when in reality the fund was actually down 18 percent. According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Shkreli falsely claimed the fund had $35 million in assets when in reality it had less than $1,000. In another example, the SEC says Shkreli lied to one of MSMB Capital Management’s executing brokers about the fund’s ability to cover a possible loss on a trade he wanted to make. When the deal lost money, Shkreli was unable to pay. Instead, the broker was forced to cover Shkreli’s position and took on losses of more than $7 million.  “When you lie to people knowingly and intentionally to get their money, it’s a crime,” federal prosecutor Jacquelyn Kasulis told jurors in closing arguments last Friday. “And that is exactly what Martin Shkreli did. He knowingly lied over and over again to his investors.” “Mr. Shkreli is a smart man ... He knew exactly what he was doing,” she added, having previously described him as “a con man who stole millions.”  Defense attorney Benjamin Brafman dismissed that portrayal, instead describing his client as a fundamentally “good kid” who scrambled to cover investors’ losses, ultimately earning a profit. “Who lost anything?” Brafman asked rhetorically during closing arguments, before answering himself: “Nobody.” Given the moniker “Pharma Bro” by members of the media, Shkreli rose to infamy in 2015, when, as CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, he raised the price of an anti-parasite drug often prescribed to HIV/AIDS patients by 5,000 percent. The move sparked widespread outrage, earning Shkreli the tag of “the most hated man in America.” Given his reputation, lawyers had a difficult time seating a jury, as potential jurors described him as “a snake” and, in one instance, pretended to wring Shkreli’s neck as he sat several feet away.

POLITICS,"Kara Eastman, a progressive abortion rights supporter, won the Democratic nomination for Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, an upset that defied the wishes of the national party.  Eastman’s narrow victory in a swing district that includes metropolitan Omaha comes as a shock to many and reflects the growing strength of the Democratic Party’s left wing. Her candidacy in the general election provides pro-choice liberals an opportunity to show that progressive Democrats are just as capable as moderates of winning in challenging territory.  “Kara Eastman taught the Democratic establishment a lesson: The way to inspire voters in 2018 is to campaign on a bold progressive agenda of Medicare for All, higher wages for workers, and other economic populist ideas that help working families and challenge corporate power,” said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which endorsed Eastman. “This is how Democrats can win in red, purple, and blue districts and maximize a wave in 2018.” “Now we see, time and time again, that we do not need to abandon abortion in order to win,” Heidi Sieck, a Nebraska native and co-founder of #VoteProChoice, said after Eastman’s victory. Eastman, founder of a public health nonprofit, defeated former Rep. Brad Ashford by nearly 3 percentage points.  Ashford, an attorney and former state lawmaker, was a rare Democrat who unseated a House Republican in 2014, only to be ousted himself after one term.  In 2016, Republican Don Bacon defeated Ashford by a single percentage point. And in the same election, the district’s voters chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton by 2 percentage points. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which helps elect Democrats to the House, apparently saw Ashford as having the best opportunity to retake the seat. The DCCC put Ashford on its list of “Red to Blue” candidates, a distinction tantamount to an official party endorsement that comes with training and other resources. But Ashford, known as a pro-business moderate, had a major weakness that likely hurt him with the Democratic base in a year of high liberal enthusiasm. As a state lawmaker, he backed restrictions on women’s abortion rights, including a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Eastman drew a sharp contrast with Ashford. Not only is she is an unabashed supporter of abortion rights, she is also an advocate of Medicare-for-all, a higher minimum wage, free college tuition for families earning less than $125,000 a year, and an assault weapons ban. The lack of support Eastman drew from national pro-abortion rights political action groups became its own source of controversy. NARAL Pro-Choice America, EMILY’s List, UltraViolet Action and Planned Parenthood Action Fund did not endorse in the race. The only abortion rights group to back Eastman was the small outfit, #VoteProChoice.   At least two of the national pro-abortion rights groups’ conduct appeared to be at odds with their involvement in an Omaha mayoral race over a year ago. In April 2017, NARAL led a very public crusade against the Democratic National Committee and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for visiting Omaha to campaign for Heath Mello, a Democrat running for mayor who backed the same 20-week abortion ban that Ashford voted for. UltraViolet joined in the effort to shame the party for supporting Mello.  Although Mello promised to protect abortion rights as mayor, coverage of the flare-up ended up dominating what was meant to be a positive campaign event. A few weeks later, Mello went onto lose the race to incumbent Republican Mayor Jean Stothert, an even stauncher abortion rights opponent. Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, pushed back against the suggestion that the organization had held Brad Ashford to a different standard than Mello. “Ashford came to Congress and voted 100% on pro-choice bills and against anti-choice bills. What are we as people if the don’t believe that we can communicate to people and move them on fundamental principles? Redemption is a progressive principle,” Hogue wrote in a Twitter thread Wednesday.  Sincere answer: Ashford came to Congress and voted 100% on pro-choice bills and against anti-choice bills. What are we as people if the don’t believe that we can communicate to people and move them on fundamental principles? Redemption is a progressive principle. https://t.co/EsXswTShKp Regardless of whether Eastman ultimately gains the support of national pro-choice groups or help from the DCCC, she has the backing of the Nebraska Democratic Party, according to party chairwoman Jane Kleeb.  “The Nebraska Democratic Party worked hard to remain neutral in this race and we are proud to have Kara Eastman representing Democrats, and soon Nebraskans, in Congress as the first woman from the Second District,” Kleeb said in a text message. This story has been updated to include comments from Hogue."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Jim Carrey’s new artwork raises doubt about President Donald Trump’s apparent bromance with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. The movie star’s latest piece suggests that Macron was happy to indulge Trump’s antics during his recent state visit to the U.S. ― but only because he thought it ultimately will help him save the world. Later there would be wedgies and wet willies in the Rose Garden. Macron, it seemed, was willing to suffer anything to keep the planet safe. pic.twitter.com/Tp7RAcUWdy In Carrey’s new painting, shared to Twitter on Thursday, Trump engages Macron in a humiliating handshake, while holding his fingers in a mocking V sign above Macron’s head. “Later there would be wedgies and wet willies in the Rose Garden,” Carrey captioned the image. “Macron, it seemed, was willing to suffer anything to keep the planet safe.” The first part of Macron’s state visit saw him exchange numerous hugs, kisses and handshakes with Trump, who labeled Macron “perfect.” During Macron’s address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, however, the French president delivered veiled criticism of Trump’s contempt for the environment. Last week, Carrey shared this piece in tribute to the Toronto van attack victims: I never thought I’d see a tragedy like this in beautiful Toronto. There’s no way to cover your eyes anymore. My heart goes out to the victims and their families. pic.twitter.com/WtTD2TDQmS"
BUSINESS,"In his early days growing Microsoft, Bill Gates was reported to be the original enfant terrible. Very tough on people and teams. And the behavior of Microsoft matched: vaporware was a term coined not to define poorly engineered software, but to hint at Microsoft’s future product development, thus terrifying entrepreneurs and venture capitalists and steering them away from investment in an area that could threaten Microsoft’s future growth. And most importantly, Microsoft had a lock-solid monopoly on their markets. Mark Zuckerberg’s start was similar to Gates. Hollywood doesn’t make a movie about you because there’s no drama. One of Facebook’s venture investors explained away Mark’s early behavior, saying it was just growing pains. Today 2 billion humans use Facebook, which defines the social network, and with smart moves like Instagram’s purchase, there’s no sign Mark’s game is fading any time soon. Now comes Uber, the most highly valued startup, growing in just seven years from nada to $70 billion with a lock on one market and the possibility of a lock on an upcoming market – self driving car booking. But for Travis Kalanick, the playbook seemed to break down. Unlike Gates and Zuckerberg, who made their mistakes in their teens and twenties, Travis does not get the youthful indiscretion excuse. At age 40 you can’t explain away boorish behavior or intentionally developing software to thwart local regulators. What went wrong for Travis, while Bill and Mark matured and prospered? Three things: first, great entrepreneurs have great partners. Always. Gates had Steve Ballmer and Paul Allen. Gates and Ballmer famously said their highest value for each other was coaching on time and priority management. That’s the essence of a great partnership. Batman and Robin, Sponge Bob and Patrick…Bill and Steve. Want more examples? Steve Jobs – he had Woz, then Jony Ive and Tim Cook. Great entrepreneurs never really go it alone. There’s always a trusted partner waiting in the wings, someone whose opinion they value who holds them accountable. Second: Great entrepreneurs recognize the difference between the front stage and the back stage – and they keep them separate. Everyone’s heard how diligently Steve Jobs worked to pull off product release events. They were shows, meticulously planned, and the public ate it up. We love cheering on a great performer, and with Steve Jobs his products really changed the way we live. And Travis? Filmed during an Uber ride in full-jerk mode with someone who is effectively an employee. It’s been viewed millions of times. Is he actually Mahatma Gandhi the other 99 percent of the time? Unlikely. If you aren’t inspiring it hurts to have your worst moments on public display, dispiriting your investors, board, employees – all of the supporters and cheerleaders you need to succeed. Which brings up the essence of leadership in the public eye in 2017: your employees are another front stage, a public representation of what your company is all about. So when employees start grumbling or in Uber’s case reports of sexual harassment and underpaid drivers surface it’s time to review what you stand for. A good part of Uber’s success was not just the technology, but a full-throated charge to enter new markets despite legal obstacles. That kind of stress needs leadership that grows and evolves as challenges grow. And because the team is responsible for executing management’s plans, biting the hand that feeds – employees, staff, vendors, investors ― is a recipe for disaster. Finally: great entrepreneurs have incredible self-discipline. Mark Zuckerberg committing to study Mandarin Chinese is an act of self-discipline. He was already a billionaire, had already arrived. He sought for higher goals and more meaning, not just the exercise of power. Morningstar founder, Joe Mansueto, is a relentless student of success, consciously designing his path from startup in a two-bedroom apartment to world-spanning financial publishing powerhouse with 4,600 employees. His design for his own progress included an intense, ongoing study of how successful companies grow, change and adapt to their increasing challenges. He read and studied to learn how to grow an organization and even more importantly how to avoid the pitfalls that trip up so many companies. He formed a board of directors years before going public – an act of self-discipline most private company owners are reluctant to take on at any point. Before he was fired, Travis announced that 14 managers would run Uber while he took a leave of absence. Fourteen. Any leader of a large, complex organization could have a delusional moment. In private. The double whammy here is that the public ever learned of such a cock-eyed idea. It’s just not the mark of a self-reflective, disciplined leader. What a way to lose the faith and confidence of investors, board, employees and customers. Steve Jobs had a comeback even more amazing than his first go-round. If you’re a fan of Pixar’s Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Wall-E, or any of its other movies, or if your iPhone or iPad are always by your side, you’re a beneficiary of Steve Jobs’ second act. Bill and Melinda Gates, philanthropists, are proving to be a tremendous force for good in the world. Bill’s second act was not a straight line from software king, but it is dazzling and inspiring. Goodbye to Travis. Here’s hoping he can eventually pull off a second act even more amazing than Uber."
POLITICS,"Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-professed mastermind of the 9/11 terror attacks, says he has information to share with lawmakers about CIA head nominee Gina Haspel ahead of her Senate confirmation hearing. Mohammed, who was repeatedly tortured by the CIA following his 2003 capture in Pakistan, sought permission this week from a Guantanamo Bay judge to “share six paragraphs of information” about Haspel with the Senate Intelligence Committee, reported The New York Times. From Guantanamo, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed wants to tell the Senate Intelligence Committee something about Gina Haspel. https://t.co/u5jowMhzyQ Haspel, who has drawn criticism for her role in a controversial CIA interrogation program, faces what is likely to be a tough confirmation hearing before the committee on Wednesday. The nature of Mohammed’s information about Haspel is unknown. One of his attorneys, Marine Lt. Col. Derek Poteet, told the Times that he was “not able to describe the information.” Poteet said that it comes directly from Mohammed and that defense lawyers “agreed that the information was important.” The CIA used several torture techniques on Mohammed, including waterboarding him 183 times and subjecting him to sleep deprivation and rectal rehydration, while the al Qaeda operative was in custody in clandestine prisons in Afghanistan and Poland.  It’s not clear whether Haspel was involved in Mohammed’s torture in any way. She has come under scrutiny, however, for serving as the head of a black site prison in Thailand in the early-2000s, where another terror suspect was tortured. Haspel has been accused of playing a part in destroying videotapes of those sessions. Haspel is expected to tell lawmakers that she “will not restart” the CIA’s controversial interrogation program as the agency’s director. It’s unclear whether Mohammed’s request for permission to share the information about Haspel will be approved before Wednesday’s hearing."
ARTS & CULTURE,"John Nation just wanted to give teenagers in Bristol, southwest England, a safe place to spray-paint without fear of arrest and prosecution. Little did the then 21-year-old youth worker know back in 1984 that his “Aerosol Art Project” at the Barton Hill Youth Center would go some way to shaping British and global street art over the coming years and decades. It spawned an entire generation of influential and genre-defining artists ― including Banksy. But as Nation, now 54, told HuffPost in a wide-ranging interview, the initiative also almost ended up costing him his job, his reputation and his liberty. Nation was just 18-years-old when, in 1981, he became an outreach worker at the youth center in his home neighborhood of Barton Hill. “We helped kids deal with the nitty gritty of life [...] providing sexual health awareness, talking about drugs, that kind of thing,” he told HuffPost. A trip to Amsterdam in 1982 sparked an interest in graffiti, which he saw adorning the Dutch capital’s streets. “I started reading whatever material I could.” Coincidentally, some of the 14 to 19-year-olds attending the center were also becoming interested in the art form. Inspired by movies such as “Wild Style” and “Beat Street” and the painting of Bristol’s earliest-recognized graffiti artist 3D (a.k.a. Robert Del Naja from Massive Attack), Nation said they’d spend hours copying outlines of the work featured in the seminal book “Subway Art.” When one teen returned from New York City with photographs of the graffiti he’d seen, Nation allowed the teen and his friends to paint the club’s front wall. “Barton Hill was rough,” Nation said. “At that time the club was very territorial, seen as right wing, predominantly white and very hostile to outsiders.” Its exterior walls, he said, were mainly daubed with anti-authority slogans such as “No Police State in Barton Hill” or ones promoting the far-right movement, the National Front. “These guys produced a piece that was so vibrant,” Nation said. “It helped break down some barriers. Lots of these guys listened to hip hop, reggae and black-inspired music. Lots of the artists they looked up to were black, hispanic and Puerto Rican, but they were in a predominantly white area. Being involved in graffiti opened their eyes and helped to lower their prejudices.” Inspired by what the teens had produced, Nation sought permission from his employers at the now-defunct Avon County Council authority to set up the “Barton Hill Aerosol Art Project” — a place he envisioned would let the youngsters, some of whom were only a bit younger than him, to “express themselves freely and legally” on the center’s walls instead of tagging or painting unauthorized spots on public or private property which could lead to their arrest. Cheo and Inkie were among the first generation of budding street artists to attend the center, which had the added appeal of being the only one in the city with an indoor skate ramp. Before long, the artists covered most of the building with their work. “Once word got out that it was a safe environment to paint and look at books and photographs and watch films about graffiti, then people from across the city started coming,” Nation said. “Once you had that one group of people give it their seal of approval, others saw it was safe and followed suit.” At its peak, more than 40 youngsters regularly attended the project. Graffiti writers from across the U.K. also visited, and it inspired other authorities from around the country to launch similar initiatives.  “It was a great atmosphere, very expressive, very creative,” Nation added. “There was never any bad vibes or competition, none of that element. It was all about being a crew and a togetherness and I still think that’s true to all the guys who still know each other and paint now.” Not everyone was in favor of the project, however. Unbeknownst to Nation, from 1988 to 1989 the British Transport Police surveilled the center and several of its artists as part of a city-wide investigation into graffiti tagging and criminal behavior. John Nation Operation Anderson sought to profile graffiti artists suspected of criminal damage and culminated with a series of raids on properties across the region. Police arrested dozens of people, including Nation. Officers searched his home and the center. “Bearing in mind that I was running an aerosol art project, there was no way there wasn’t going to be any material at the center,” he said. “It was like an Aladdin’s Cave for them.” Police seized a “massive stash of paint” Nation had procured from the project’s sponsors and his treasured 5,000-plus snaps of graffiti he’d either taken himself or been sent by writers from around the world.  Nation believes police thought the club was “some kind of ‘Axis of Evil’ that was the main meeting point for all of Bristol’s illegal graffiti writers and a place where other writers from across the country would come.”  “It wasn’t that at all though,” he said, although he acknowledges some of the artists were painting on unauthorized spots on their own.  As was revealed in the BBC documentary “Drawing The Line,” (above), police matched tags on the artwork in the club to tags on illegal works across the city.  They charged several artists with criminal damage. Nation himself was charged with suspicion of conspiracy to incite individuals to commit criminal damage.  “Their main case against me was that the photos and books I had, if shown to a young person of impressional age, would incite them to go out and commit criminal damage,” Nation said. “They also said I was covering up for the young people and I was duty bound to divulge information on them. But I didn’t assist them whatsoever. I answered ‘no comment’ to pretty much everything.” Several artists were found guilty of criminal damage and received fines. Nation’s charge, however, was dropped on the day his trial was due to begin after prosecutors offered no evidence of incitement.  A post shared by John Nation (@johnnation) on Jun 1, 2017 at 8:53am PDT Nation says he then consciously used the subsequent press coverage to promote his project’s work and to argue that without a place to legally paint, “the illegal culture of the art form just gets reinforced.” Following the police raids, Nation says many of those involved in the city’s street art scene went “underground for a while.” “It was like they were regrouping,” he said. “Many of the guys arrested took a break, lessened their illegal activities, and some decided painting legally was the only way.” Nation says the publicity did inspire, however, a new generation of artists to begin visiting the project ― with one of them being Banksy. “As a young boy, he’d come to the center and watch people paint. He was heavily into hip hop culture, graffiti, and Barton Hill was where it was happening. Every weekend there was fresh work going up on the walls and people would exchange ideas,” Nation said.  “He says he called it his religious pilgrimage every weekend to go. Many of these guys had their own crazy, little dreams and he said what Barton Hill showed him was very powerful, that you could go on to follow those dreams.” At that time, Nation says Banksy (who despite multiple attempts and theories has never been officially identified), wasn’t producing the political or social commentary pieces that he’s since become globally famous for.  As part of a crew with some slightly older teens, Nation says he was “into graffiti and letterforms and writing.” He also didn’t stand out “as one of the graffiti writers you’d call a ‘top boy,’” nor was he using his “Banksy” moniker either, says Nation. “The Banksy thing came later.” Nation claims Banksy is “without doubt” the biggest contemporary artist in the world right now, but admits he didn’t foresee his rise to prominence during his early days of painting at the center. Instead, he believes Banksy truly began to make his mark when he changed his style and began using stencils. “Not only could he paint quicker, he could paint more locations and produce more work. He started off with quite crude stencil work, like the rats, then he started progressing to more clean work, more sharper,” Nation said. “These smaller stencils started appearing across the city and for me, it’s once he made that conscious decision to change the style of what he was painting and the content of what he was painting when he exploded,” he added. Banksy himself admits in his book “Wall and Piece” that his switch in style came when aged 18 transport police chased him through a thorny bush after spotting him painting “LATE AGAIN” on the side of a train. “The rest of my mates made it to the car and disappeared so I spent over an hour hidden under a dumper truck with engine oil leaking all over me,” he wrote. “As I lay there listening to the cops on the tracks I realized I had to cut my painting time in half or give up altogether. I was staring straight up at the stenciled plate on the bottom of a fuel tank when I realized I could just copy that style and make each letter three feet high.” Nation said that change led Banksy to “strike an accord with first and foremost the Bristol public, and then the British public.” “Lots of people who wouldn’t be into street art could relate to the simplicity and the fun and the characters he was painting. As he’s become more mature, the images and message have become more hard-hitting — he’s a clever guy.”  A post shared by Banksy (@banksy) on May 7, 2017 at 6:40am PDT Nation does question how Banksy creates some of his works, such as the “Brexit” piece (above) that he unveiled in Dover, southeast England, in May as a commentary on the U.K.’s referendum vote to leave the European Union. “Yes he painted it, but he’s got to have a team of people that set up the scaffold and he must have approached the people who own the property before that,” Nation said. “You can’t just rock up and set up a scaffold on the side of someone’s property without there being no questions asked. It’s a huge wall. It’s massive.” With so much history between Nation and Banksy, one may assume the pair remain close and in touch. When faced with the suggestion, however, Nation responded with a stony silence before changing the subject. While the legacy of the Barton Hill Youth Center often focuses on Banksy, many of the center’s other alum have also gone on to enjoy hugely successful careers. Jody Thomas, who in April gave HuffPost a helping hand in unveiling its new logo (below), has painted and exhibited his signature photo-realistic style around the world: But for him, it also all began at the center, which he first attended when he was just 15 years old after being encouraged by a school friend who’d described Nation to him as “outspoken, politically militant and not one to suffer fools.”  “It felt like I was being led to meet the leader of a despotic cult,” Thomas told HuffPost, adding that Nation “didn’t disappoint” when he finally met him.  “He immediately went through my school folder of work based around the comic art of 2,000 A.D. and classical painting and drawings,” he said. “I think he saw in me the opportunity to add a different artistic dimension to the club’s repertoire and left me to recreate on the walls of the club what I had on paper.” Jody Thomas Thomas credits Nation as being at “the forefront” of the street art movement at that time. “His energy and personality has garnered him an amount of respect amongst Bristolians on the level of any rock star or public figure,” he said. “For me, he is the ‘Darwin’ of street art in the U.K. and gave me a opportunity to express the art that spoke to me all those years ago.” The admiration is mutual. Nation still remembers the day that Thomas first brought in his work which was “totally different” to what was being produced in the club at the time. “I thought to myself, ‘fucking hell, this is amazing. He’s 15 and painting like this?’ I thought, ‘this boy is going to go far,’” Nation said. “At first he wasn’t accepted as much by the graffiti lads. Jody was into indie music and a lot of that music had dark imagery on its album sleeves,” he added. “He embraced that kind of artwork. He painted small pieces, then he painted these two black and white heads (below) and that was it. I have a lot of time for him. He didn’t stick to what everyone else was doing. He just wanted to be an artist and express his talents.” Inkie, a.k.a. Tom Bingle, also emerged from the center. He’s since worked as a head of design at SEGA and hosted his own shows across the globe. Recently, he painted alongside Shepard Fairey, the artist behind the “Hope” poster that came to define former President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign. For Inkie, Nation’s project acted as a vital “central hub” for the city’s graffiti artists in the pre-internet era of the late ‘80s to mid-90s. “Without this center and John’s support of our artwork, Bristol would not have had the scene it maintains today,” he told HuffPost. By 1991, however, Nation had become disillusioned with the restraints he felt the authority was putting on him and quit. “I was seen as being quite outspoken, left wing and a bit of a socialist,” he said. “But I’m proud of what I did back then. And the fact that people still talk about then and what I achieved for me is justification for what I did do.” Nation went on to forge a successful career in promoting dance music events across the U.K. and the NASS action sports and music show in Somerset.  With the explosion in the popularity of street art, which he puts principally down to the rise of the internet and social media, he’s since come full circle ― and now gives regular tours of Bristol’s scene via the WhereTheWall tour. “People from all over the world come, and no one tour is the same. Street art is here today, gone tomorrow. The art form is transient,” he said. In April, Nation curated his first ever solo show, “Graffiti Nation,” at Bristol’s Upfest gallery, the home of Europe’s largest live street art festival. He also worked with Inkie on the “See No Evil” art exhibition in 2011 and 2012, and remains a fierce advocate for spaces where artists can legally paint. He’s also set to feature in another BBC documentary, which will analyze the U.K. street art scene in the decades since Operation Anderson. Nation’s pedigree, knowledge and influence of street art and the genres that umbrella term encompasses have seen him nicknamed the “Godfather” of the Bristol (and increasingly British) scene. But it’s a label that doesn’t sit well with him. “I look back and I feel that all those years ago I was vilified and I could have possibly lost my job,” he said. “Then two years ago I’m being used as the face of Bristol tourism as someone who represents it as a progressive, cultural city. Who would have thought it?” “I get called the ‘Godfather,’ but I’m not. I just had a faith and a belief in these young people when no one else would give them the time of day,” he added. “I’m just lucky enough that i’ve been involved in the graffiti scene and seen it emerge. Bristol is not what it is because of me, far from it. I’m just one cog in the wheel, just like Banksy and all the others.” Check out John Nation’s Instagram, Facebook and the tour website for WhereTheWall."
ARTS & CULTURE," Anyone that knows me well would probably tell you that I am a pretty happy, easily excitable, energetic and young-spirited dude, for the most part. The truth is, I am. But if I were being honest, there was a lot of sacrifice, struggle, and discipline that went into getting to and maintaining that sort of state of being... a lot.  As I'm sure, like most of you, my 20's were all over the place and exceptionally tough. An array of extremes of almost every emotion one could possibly experience. I think it's due to the fact that I have always had this innately curious little kid/artist living inside of me as far as I can remember. But the truth is, by choosing to live a life led by passion, excitement, wonder, and a constant search for adventure is basically a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it's caused me a lot of pain, disappointment, heartbreak, jadedness, isolation, and depression at times. But on the other hand, I have experienced extremely high levels of achievement, adventure, joy, peace, fulfillment, magic, soulfulness and love too. All that considered, I am humbled and so thankful that I have no regrets and wouldn't change a thing. I am who I am today because of every experience my journey has provided me - a loving, open, humble, excited, talented, and dedicated man. Now, in the heart of pursuing my dreams like I never thought could be possible.  Here are some specific feats and milestones that happened throughout the past 10 years that I think are pretty rad:  So from my crazy journey up to this point in time, here are some of the most important lessons I have learned. I hope you find them helpful in one way or another. I've attempted to place them in a sort of sequential order, at least in the way I've experienced it anyways. Take it for what it's worth.  1. Follow the energy - this is very important initial , and often times overlooked. It isn't to be confused with some sort of ""hippy jargon"" either. I mean it in the most basic sense - don't just pursue who and what might appear to be the safest or most secure. Instead strive to really stay connected and rooted in all that gives you the most excitement and joy. Watch a little child freely play and explore what their imagination has to offer them, and then you'll get a better picture of what I mean.  2. Hone your craft - with an elevated awareness of what energizes you the most, it will then reveal the thing(s) you can achieve at the highest level. Invite yourself on a quest to discover what might be ""the one thing"" you can be the best in the world at. It probably sounds daunting it impossible at first, but before you discredit yourself, sit with it for a while and just watch what happens. Which brings me to my next idea....   3. Trust & surrender to the process - when I was younger I didn't quite get this. Being very ""goal"" oriented, I found myself focused more on striving to accomplish or achieve greatness, but at the expense of relationships, peace, and noticing the big picture. It's all about the journey  4. Prayer and meditation - I happen to be a very spiritually sensitive person, who holds my faith in God. I believe that God hears you, He loves you, and has a master-crafted purpose for your life. Even if you don't share a similar belief, I still highly recommend pursuing a discipline of pausing and remaining mindful. Allot time out of each day to concentrate and listen carefully to the voice within.   5. Actively seek out mentors and advisers - I am very humbled and grateful to be able to have such incredible leaders, mentors, and colleagues in my life - most of whom are all older than me. In the words from my most treasured mentor, the 91-year-old living legend Dr. Carroll Rinehart, he pretty much nails it with these words I will never forget and will forever do my best to put into action: ""Be as authentic as you can in the moment given, where others will freely receive what you'll freely give."" -DCR Are you kidding me? Just take a few minutes (or years in my case) and enjoy the process of really wrapping your head and heart around that one! And trust me, there's A LOT more where that came from. But furthering my point; no matter how smart you think you are, there's always someone older & wiser in your sphere of influence who will speak into your life and challenge you to be the best version of yourself, if you allow them to of course.  I hope this finds you well and that you read this feeling inspired, encouraged, and motivated in some way. If you want to hear more, I touch on some of these ideas more depth in the keynote I gave for TEDx back in winter 2014. feel free to check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqNgzpdbjVs Thank you so much for reading.

ARTS & CULTURE,"The Refugees, Viet Thanh Nguyen’s fiction follow-up to his acclaimed debut novel, The Sympathizer, would be critically praised at any historical moment. But, as it happens, it arrived at this one: Just a couple short weeks after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that brought the U.S. refugee program to a screeching pause and indefinitely barred Syrian refugees from entering the country. The collection, dedicated “For all refugees, everywhere,” is a compilation of nine haunting stories that follow the lives of refugees and their children, reflecting on how they process the trauma they’ve suffered and cling to fingerholds in both the old world and the new. As the swell of coverage suggests, it’s the perfect book to read at this historical moment in America, when a massive global refugee crisis is colliding with a government’s resistance to accepting them into the country.  “We need to understand how refugees are different [from immigrants] so that we don’t erase the specificity of their experience,” Nguyen recently told BuzzFeed’s Doree Shafrir. Instead of choosing to leave their homeland to pursue a different life, refugees have fled a home where it’s no longer possible to live safely. Their home, as they remember it, probably doesn’t really exist anymore. Simply staying, or even going back to visit, may not be viable options. In The Refugees, characters are tormented by loved ones lost in the conflict that drove them to flee, sacrifices made to bring them to a safer place, and the distance of a homeland left under duress. The refugees are drawn with the kind of affectionate warmth that’s frank about flaws but accepting of the whole. Even the most nominally comfortable refugees in Nguyen’s stories are nursing deep wounds. In the first story, a Vietnamese woman who fled with her family as a girl now makes a living ghostwriting for people having their 15 minutes of fame. She lives alone with her mother, but one day, someone unexpected arrives: her brother, who died 25 years ago during their escape. “You died too,” her brother’s ghost tells her. “You just don’t know it.” Wracked with guilt over her brother’s death, she’s become a husk, a vehicle for the stories of other people. Becoming refugees destroyed them both. In “I’d Love You To Want Me,” an aging professor in a slow decline from dementia begins to call his wife of many decades by another woman’s name. Committed to his daily care, she bridles at the insult, and frets over who the other woman might have been. Her son Vinh sometimes checks on her; brought to America with his siblings at a very young age, he is utterly Americanized and alienating to her. But, she recalls, even on the tiny boat on which they escaped, she kept their hair neat and their faces clean. She knows how to keep up appearances in the face of the most catastrophic sufferings, or the most quotidian. Nguyen’s stories are carefully structured, but it’s these psychological portraits that make them sing. The pacing of certain stories might be less than propulsive, or the climax a bit limp, but the people within them are crackling with life. The refugees are drawn with the kind of affectionate warmth that’s frank about flaws but accepting of the whole. “The Other Man” is an engrossing character sketch of a young refugee who’s taken in by a gay couple in San Francisco. In close third person, his visceral desires slip through, stifled beneath a mantle of courtesy and a conservative upbringing.  Other stories do combine sharply observed psychology with a forceful arc. In “The Transplant,” a man with a gambling problem, a bad liver and a crumbling marriage, Arthur, gets a new chance to make good after receiving an organ donation from an anonymous donor. After learning the name of the donor, Men Vu, Arthur and his wife hunt down one of his sons, Louis, to thank him. A friendship forms; a grateful Arthur lets Louis warehouse knockoff luxury goods in their garage. When he learns that the man he believed was his savior’s son may be no such thing, he slowly realizes that he’s once again lost control of his own life. Stymied in a bid to turn in or evict the black-market mogul, he surveys his garage:  Louis had conquered every square foot of storage for his fountain pens with their plastic barrels, his sunglasses without ultraviolet protection, his watches that kept perfect time for a day, his designer jackets without linings, his pants with hems that unraveled easily, his discs of pirated movies filmed surreptitiously in theaters, his reproductions of Microsoft software so perfect as to come with the bugs infesting the genuine item, his pseudopills that might or might not help, might or might not harm. With the self-reflection of memoir and the clear-eyed, impartial narration of a history, Nguyen takes readers deep inside his characters in a mere few pages. What he finds there is humanity at neither its worst nor its best, but simply the well-meaning, flawed manifestation we can easily recognize ourselves in.  It’s easy to say that a book called The Refugees matters more than ever right now. It’s also true. For some readers, the collection will tell stories familiar to them, stories they’d recognize from their own families. For others, it will be eye-opening. If Americans have been confronted with a need to break out of their bubbles and experience realities outside themselves, this collection offers that jolt to many readers who have been able to take for granted their American citizenship. These stories make it harder to imagine refugees as threatening, spectral figures advancing like predators on our borders.  The Refugees is also just good. Read it now, or read it later ― but read it.  The bottom line: In nine psychologically evocative short stories, Nguyen lays bare the trauma and emotional ambivalence that lie beneath sentimental or heroic tales of refugees. What other reviewers think: The New Yorker: “Nguyen’s narrative style — restrained, spare, avoiding metaphor or the syntactical virtuosity on display in every paragraph of ‘The Sympathizer’ — is well suited for portraying tentative states. His characters are emotional convalescents, groping their way to an understanding of their woundedness.” The Washington Post: “This is an important and incisive book written by a major writer with firsthand knowledge of the human rights drama exploding on the international stage — and the talent to give us inroads toward understanding it.” Who wrote it? Viet Thanh Nguyen is the author of several books, including the novel The Sympathizer, which won a number of awards including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The Refugees is his first story collection. Born in Vietnam, Nguyen grew up in America after his family fled the Viet Cong. He now lives in Los Angeles and is a professor of English and American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of Southern California. Who will read it? Readers drawn to immigrant stories, and those who hope to make sense of current events through fiction. Opening lines: “Fame would strike someone, usually the kind that healthy-minded people would not wish upon themselves, such as being kidnapped and kept prisoner for years, suffering humiliation in a sex scandal, or surviving something typically fatal. These survivors needed someone to help write their memoirs, and their agents might eventually come across me. ‘At least your name’s not on anything,’ my mother once said.” Notable passage: “What she wanted to say, but wouldn’t, was that he should not be frightened. He was not going to die here. But he was frightened, more so than he had ever expected to be. Before Michiko and the children, he believed he would die in an airplane or behind the wheel of a very fast car, anything involving high velocity and a sudden, arresting stop. Now he knew he would probably die with panic pooling in his lungs, in a place where he was not supposed to be, on the wrong side of the world.” The RefugeesBy Viet Thanh NguyenGrove Atlantic, $25.00Published Feb. 7, 2017   The Bottom Line is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Guitarist Keith Richards was once so angry at Donald Trump that he pulled out a knife ― when the future president wasn’t in the room ― and stabbed a table.  The rock icon told the BBC that back in 1989, Trump was the promoter of the Rolling Stones’ “Steel Wheels” tour dates in Atlantic City. When the band arrived, however, they found Trump’s name in huge letters and the band’s name in much smaller type. “I got out my trusty blade, stuck it in the table and said: ‘You have to get rid of this man!’” Richards told the BBC. “Now America has to get rid of him. Don’t say I didn’t warn you!”  Concert promoter Michael Cohl told a version of Richards’ story in 2015, saying Trump had agreed to host a pay-per-view event featuring the Stones in Atlantic City. But the band wanted nothing to do with him ― and when Trump turned up, Richards ordered Cohl to get rid of him.  “Keith pulls out his knife and slams it on the table and says, ‘What the hell do I have you for? Do I have to go over there and fire him myself?” Cohl recalled, per the Los Angeles Times. “One of us is leaving the building – either him or us.’”  In 2015, Richards told Billboard that Trump was “refreshing” and “cut through a lot of crap.” Yet that wasn’t exactly an endorsement.  “Can you imagine President Trump? The worst nightmare,” Richards said. “But we can’t say that. Because it could happen. This is one of the wonders of this country. Who would’ve thought Ronald Reagan could be president?” Mick Jagger also commented on Trump in the new BBC interview, saying he’s puzzled by the president’s use of the band’s song “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” at his events.  “It’s a funny song for a play-out song ― a drowsy ballad about drugs in Chelsea!” Jagger told the BBC. “It’s kind of weird. He couldn’t be persuaded to use something else.” The latest leg of the band’s “No Filter” European tour begins on Thursday.   "
ENTERTAINMENT,"Somewhere in the Hollywood Hills, Ben Affleck whispers, “Touché,” as he takes another drag from his vape pen. The “Justice League” star no longer soldiers alone when it comes to inexplicably large back tattoos, after actor Justin Theroux debuted one of his own. The former Mr. Jennifer Aniston and Selena Gomez’s current lunch date appeared at a live recording of “Queer Eye” grooming guru Jonathan Van Ness’ podcast at the Vulture Festival over the weekend. When a fan asked the heavily tattooed star for the backstory on some of his ink, he lifted his shirt to expose a giant tattoo of a pigeon and a rat on his back, giving fans a peek at some previously unseen body art.  “So I had two dogs, both rescues, pit bulls … and when they died, I dedicated half my back to one and half of my back to the other,” he explained. “So it’s a picture of a rat because my dog used to kill rats in Washington Square Park. It was horrible. I mean, they were doing a service to New York. Oh, and then a pigeon. A New York pigeon and a rat.” Now, Theroux didn’t show the entire tattoo, but from what we can tell, he inked the image of a rather large rodent crawling done his spine, surrounded by artwork. And unlike Affleck, the “Leftovers” actor doesn’t seem particularly regretful about the decision.  Affleck’s giant tattoo of a rising phoenix spanning from shoulder to shoulder first caught our eye in 2015, amid his divorce from actress Jennifer Garner.  He later jokingly called his tattoos “garish” in response to a New Yorker article titled “The Great Sadness of Ben Affleck” about his presumed midlife crisis.  It’s unclear when exactly Theroux got the tattoo ― he announced his split from Aniston in February ― so it’s not fair to say their relationship had anything to with his ink. But in case this turns into some kind of disturbing trend, someone please tell freshly single Channing Tatum that this is NOT the way to move on. "
BUSINESS,"Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak is ditching Facebook.  “Users provide every detail of their life to Facebook and ... Facebook makes a lot of advertising money off this,” Wozniak told USA Today via email. “The profits are all based on the user’s info, but the users get none of the profits back.”  He also told the newspaper that he had deactivated his account, but did not delete it to keep control over his “SteveWoz” screen name. “I don’t want someone else grabbing it, even another Steve Wozniak,” he said. Before deactivating the account, Wozniak posted a goodbye message.  “It’s brought me more negatives than positives,” he wrote.  Wozniak is the latest public figure to ditch the social network after a whistleblower revealed that the personal data of millions of users had been improperly shared with a third party.  Last month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk not only quit Facebook, he also pulled the pages for Tesla, SpaceX and SolarCity. Brian Acton, a cofounder of WhatsApp, urged people to delete Facebook, which bought his company for $19 billion in 2014.  Playboy also deleted its Facebook presence.  A number of celebrities have left Facebook as well, including comedians Will Ferrell and Jim Carrey.  “We must encourage more oversight by the owners of these social media platforms,” Carrey told CNBC in February, saying he was also dumping his stock in the company. “This easy access has to be more responsibly handled. What we need now are activist investors to send a message that responsible oversight is needed. What the world needs now is capitalism with a conscience.” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify in Congress this week in connection with the company’s data practices and the scandal surrounding it. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Robert James Waller, the author best known for his 1992 novel The Bridges of Madison County, has died. He was 77 years old. According to Aaron M. Priest Literary Agency, Waller died either Thursday or early Friday in Texas. Agent Lucy Childs told The Associated Press that she did not know the cause, but was aware that the author had been ill. Waller, born in Rockford, Iowa, in 1939, wrote a series of novels and non-fiction works throughout his life, including The Bridges of Madison County (originally titled Love in Black and White in the U.K.), 1993’s Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend, 1995’s Puerto Vallarta Squeeze, and 2002’s A Thousand Country Roads (the sequel to Bridges).  Bridges and Puerto Vallarta Squeeze were both adapted into films, the former starring Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood, the latter Harvey Keitel.  Bridges follows an Italian-American woman living in Madison County, Iowa, with her farmer husband in the 1960s. Feeling isolated, she begins a short affair with a photographer from Washington state, who is visiting the area for a National Geographic project on the town’s covered bridges. Though the story reads like an account written by the primary character, Francesca, the tale is fictional.  Critic L.S. Klepp wrote in 1992 of the book: It seems likely to melt all but the most determined cynics. Even those of us who think that romantic love contains more than the usual share of human illusion are willingly floored by it now and then, in literature as in life. Waller reportedly wrote Bridges 11 days and saw it climb to No. 1 on The New York Times best-seller list, on which it stayed for over three years. The novel, which was also adapted into a Broadway musical, inspired many engaged couples to travel to Madison County’s covered bridges to get married. The Huffington Post has reached out to Aaron M. Priest Literary Agency and will update this post accordingly."

ARTS & CULTURE,"Most eye-grabbing headlines in the art world seem to revolve around the economics of art. Whether it’s a Picasso nabbing a record-breaking offer at auction or a priceless piece vanishing from a museum in a daring heist, the monetary value of artworks fascinates us.  Some criticize the massive prices paid out for rare works as obscenely decadent. It’s easy to forget, in a world where a painting can represent an investment of millions, the more idealistic side of art, where beauty and ideas reign supreme.

Curators for a Cause makes use of its co-founders’ artistic and curatorial skills to curate and sell art to benefit their charitable partners.  “The three of us are all deeply inspired by the arts and driven to giving back to society in general -- more specifically to supply children from underserved communities around the world with various educational, creative and therapeutic platforms,” explained Simone.

CFAC also offers a platform to artists, especially those interested in using their talents for the greater good. “As an artist I have always been involved with charity foundations,” artist Marco Gallotta told HuffPost via email. Gallotta donated all of the work he featured in CFAC projects, but also emphasized that they “realize that the artists involved in the projects play an important role.” Artists who don’t choose to donate do receive compensation for their work.

Though the cofounders of CFAC aren’t new to the world of art philanthropy, this organization is still in its infancy. Still, said Simone, they’ve found that “all that really matters is that our hearts are in the right place … our genuine love for children, humanity, teaching and giving back, coupled with our immense passion for the arts has graced us with amazing and fulfilling opportunities.” It’s at least allowed them to build a project that celebrates the joy of creating and being surrounded by art, instead of the potential financial rewards, and that’s an attitude the art world can benefit from.

POLITICS,"Rudy Giuliani put it all out on the table this week. And now, after days of confusion and speculation that he may have exposed President Donald Trump to new legal jeopardy, he’s gathering it all back in. In remarks to the media Friday, Trump contradicted statements the former New York City mayor made earlier in the week regarding a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election. “He just started yesterday,” Trump said of Giuliani, who started as the lead attorney regarding issues related to special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation in late April. “He’ll get his facts straight.” On Wednesday, Giuliani made waves when he told Fox News the president had in fact repaid his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, for the funds. Trump had previously denied all knowledge of the payment. Trump seemed to initially confirm Giuliani’s statements in a series of tweets on Thursday morning. As of Friday, though, Trump’s explanation is apparently that Giuliani didn’t know what he was talking about.  “When Rudy made the statements ― he’s great ― but Rudy had just started and he wasn’t totally familiar with everything,” Trump said. “And Rudy ― we love Rudy ― he’s a special guy. What he really understands is this is a witch hunt.” “But when he made certain statements, he just started yesterday,” the president went on. “So that’s it.” “It’s actually very simple,“ Trump added. “I say, you know what, learn before you speak. It’s a lot easier.” In a statement released Friday afternoon, Giuliani capitulated to the President’s version of the Daniels payment. “First: There is no campaign violation,” he said. “The payment was made to resolve a personal and false allegation in order to protect the President’s family. It would have been done in any event, whether he was a candidate or not.   “Second: My references to timing were not describing my understanding of the President’s knowledge, but instead, my understanding of these matters.” Watch excerpts from the president’s remarks below: Trump throwing Rudy under the bus a bit: ""I'll tell you this: When Rudy made the statements— Rudy's great— but Rudy had just started and wasn't totally familiar with everything.""

ARTS & CULTURE,"Last week, after Kellyanne Conway gave an interview describing falsehoods as “alternative facts,” sales of George Orwell’s decades-old classic 1984 spiked. The book, a part of so many high-school syllabi, appears to be helping people contextualize political rhetoric; the sales boost even led Michiko Kakutani at The New York Times to write an homage to the still-relevant novel, headlined “Why ‘1984’ Is a 2017 Must-Read.” But, as The New Republic pointed out, it’s not the only title that can offer valuable insight. Writer Josephine Livingston suggested that Franz Kafka’s The Trial might be a more salient comparison. Sophie Gilbert noted in The Atlantic that Sinclair Lewis and Hannah Arendt books have also seen sales boosts in the past year. When it comes to undermining the media, controlling the dissemination of information and political leaders’ contradictions, there’s plenty of literary precedent. If you’ve read Orwell and are looking for more novels on these topics, there’s a range of dystopian and realistic fiction grappling with censorship and propaganda. We’ve collected a few below: Marra’s connected stories span generations, showing how history erodes certain truths and throws others into relief. The first story is about a more concrete kind of censorship; its protagonist works in Joseph Stalin’s Department of Party Propaganda and Agitation, literally removing faces from paintings and newspapers. When he fails to do his job, haunted by the face of a familiar-looking ballerina, there are consequences. The dystopian world imagined by Graedon isn’t so dissimilar from our own, which is what makes her novel particularly frightening. A sort of neurological disease has the potential to infect the tech-obsessed, making them no longer able to communicate clearly. Deeper readers remain more or less immune to the affliction, anchored as they are in context.   Barnes’ latest novel isn’t a dystopian one, but an intimate look at the life of an artist under tyrannical watch. Composer Dmitri Shostakovich goes unnoticed by Stalin until the ruler makes his negative thoughts on his music clear. He’s neither killed nor exiled, but instead made to represent Soivet ideals, forcing him to question which is more valuable: his art or his life.   In his review of Mandanipour’s novel, the critic James Wood reminded readers that “tyranny is the mother of metaphor, and all that.” In other words, a novelist hailing from a country where censorship is a literary restriction might get creative with his storytelling methods. Such is the case in this love story, centered on what can and can’t be communicated publicly about a private relationship.  Ah, teens. Their tendency to spew righteous, thinly researched nonsense is annoying, but it’s harmless ― endearing, even. Right? Not so in Marcus’ experimental novel, where the language of young people is physically harmful to their parents. Naturally, chaos follows; unethical testing practices ensue, and the novel’s hero, Sam, strikes out on his own to find a cure. Which is all to say that words are as capable of harm as actions.  When we imagine censorship, we imagine good citizens silenced by overt governmental mandates, finding clever new ways to express themselves in spite of noxious restrictions. In Eggers’ novel ― soon to be adapted into a film ― censorship is more complicated than that. It stems instead from a well-meaning corporate culture gone awry. At the Circle ― a Google-meets-Facebook conglomerate ― openness is valued over privacy, and self-censorship arises as a result.  Another beloved book soon to be adapted for the screen, Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale is about a religious fundamentalist movement that occurs swiftly, oppressing women in its wake. In this imagined dystopia, called Gilead, women are issued uniforms and are separated from their families. They’re also not allowed to read ― knowledge, after all, is freeing.  If the choppy-sounding title of Shteyngart’s most recent novel ― Super Sad True Love Story ― doesn’t sound to you like Doublespeak, maybe the 1984 connection will be made clearer by its premise. In a near-future society where personal devices and individual “scores” are obsessed over, relationships are stripped of their nuance and intimate connection is nearly impossible. Sad! In Johnson’s portrayal of North Korea, the government is prone to doing one thing while publicly declaring that it’s doing an entirely different thing. It’s a tactic that, on an individual level, can lead citizens to question their own perceptions of reality; on a large, governmental scale, the method of control is even more potent. To illustrate the rift between private and public knowledge, the book is told both from a first-person perspective, using the language of sheeny propaganda.  An apolitical playwright — American born, German raised — stays in Germany during World War II, and joins onto the Nazis’ propaganda campaign. After the war, he returns to America, where he eventually becomes a symbol of a white supremacist group. The story, like Vonnegut’s Bluebeard, is written as he narrates the writing of his own diary.

ARTS & CULTURE,"In a very particular world, dominated by a very particular breed of men, Trisha Williams decided to step to the forefront and give this dangerous milieu exactly what it needs. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the world of video games.  Ten years ago, Trisha Williams was working at Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment in Arizona, where she met her now partner and boyfriend, Joe Unger. Both individuals have lead a life fascinated by video games and comic books. It wasn't until the company at which they were both employed decided to lay everybody off that they took their hobbies to the next level. This became an opportunity to create their own liberating path towards a future that combines successful business and genuine passion. Sure, it took a few years before the two finally joined forces. Trisha Williams moved to Seattle where she was a professor of Game Art and Design at the Art Institute and Joe took himself to Los Angeles. Eventually the two fell in love. After experiencing consistently tumultuous relationships with already established studios, they both said ""Let's pack everything, move to San Diego and start our own company."" And that's when Pigeon Hole Productions was formed.   To some, video games and comic books are primarily for the purpose of entertainment and distraction. But there exists a laudable side to these intricate hobbies that are easily deemed fine art and an operation of science. When I spoke to Trisha, I asked her what she would say to the many people who do not believe that video games qualify as fine art.  ""It is an unbelievable amount of work and goes far beyond anything I've ever done in fine art. Everything still applies. You need to know perspective, color theory, the value of silhouette. You have to know your composition and predict how people are going to view a particular object. Viewers are not only looking at your art, but they are interacting with it. They can make something happen with it. There is also this almighty role you have to play when designing. Every aspect of it needs a reaction. You have no idea what the viewer is going to do so you must adapt to every situation, all the while maintaining this beautiful artistic environment.""  Although Trisha has been in the gaming and art world for over 10 years and has become something close to a master of design and technique, it hasn't been easy digging a groove into this world for herself. Unfortunately, like many industries, the percentage of women in charge is almost always minute compared to that of men. Even after Trisha graduated from Minnesota State University Moorhead with a BFA and moved on to get her Masters of Interactive Technology from The Guildhall at SMU, professors would still question the durability of her role as a woman in this gaming world.  ""They would pull me aside and give me an overview of all the obstacles I was going to run into. Basically they were warning me. It always ended with them asking ""Are you ready for this?"" Even when I was well into the field and attending expos and conferences, it was always assumed that I was the girlfriend of someone and not a creator myself. When I was teaching in Seattle, I would have a student ask ""Well, what do you know about video games?"" My response was always something along the lines of, ""Well, sit down. Try not to get an F and I'll let you know."" Like any committed artist, Trisha continued creating games and comics despite small turmoil. And one rainy day, while she combatted her indoor boredom, she decided to start her own webcomic. Unlike the majority, this webcomic featured girls as the gaming stars. Within a month of starting the webcomic, Trisha had online publishers looking to put it on view.  ""Gamer Girl Pinups"" disregards the cliches of who is usually behind the controller. The webcomic reflects Trisha's sharp, colorful and visionary illustration style and the proposal of an open, unguarded comic world. There are five main girls- Tanooki, Eve, Nessa, Tru and 9Key- each with their own panache and relatable attributes.    In a constant battle between her fine art side and her digital art side, Trisha settled on combining the two, which in the end, stirred up this modern idea with a clear message: ""It doesn't matter who you are, what you look like or what [imaginary] category you think you belong in, everyone should be accepted into this gaming and comic culture. It's a world of art and creativity. Just be you.""

BUSINESS,"If every recipient of a KitchenAid Mixer sold on Amazon since Nov. 1 decided to bake cookies at the same time, they would make around 7.5 million cookies at once. The takeaway here isn’t that the world is in desperate need of more cookies (although, generally speaking, it couldn’t hurt), but that Amazon had a fantastic holiday shopping season. Its “best-ever,” according to a company release, with more than one billion items shipped around the globe. (The company declined to share more detailed sales figures with The Huffington Post.) Other interesting highlights from the report include: As Amazon churned out more sales than ever, traditional retail was relatively stagnant, according to Bloomberg Gadfly columnist Shelly Banjo. Banjo says the temperature of U.S. holiday retail sales was “lukewarm” this year, despite high consumer confidence scores: Amazon’s best-selling products were the Echo and Echo Dot, its voice-activated digital assistants that can read recipes, play music and perform tasks like turning lights on and off. The most-requested drink recipes via Amazon’s digital assistant “Alexa” were Tom Collins and Manhattans, while the most-requested food tips concerned turkey, prime rib and chocolate chip cookies. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Most of us, upon hearing the term amuse-bouche, instantly think of food. But in some situations I often think of programs which offer a collection of short plays -- or a retrospective of a composer or lyricist's career -- as a long string of amuse-bouches. Some are tastier and have more heft than others; some have an almost ethereal appeal. Taken together, the whole often becomes greater than the sum of its parts. Yet it is the program's individual ingredients, like spices balanced against each other, which become the evening's true gems. Two such programs recently entertained Bay area audiences. * * * * * * * * * * Two of the short plays featured in the Best of Playground 19 program took a curious approach to issues affecting the lives of some San Franciscans. With George & Ira Gershwin's ""Someone To Watch Over Me"" as an emotional touchstone, Genne Murphy's three-character play entitled Someone looked at a recurrent fantasy affecting the lives of Max (Michael Phillis) and his husband, Andy (Michael Barrett Austin). As directed by Jeffrey Lo, Max has been enjoying an imaginary visit with his daughter, Hannah (Melissa Ortiz), who should now be old enough to go to her school's prom. However, the sad truth is that because Hannah's mother has kept the young girl away from her biological father, Max can only dream about the kind of devoted parent he might have been. As usual, Phillis continues to impress audiences each season with the depth of his acting.  Here's a teaser from the play: Directed by Jon Tracy, Kirk Shimono's Art and Tech focuses on a source of local tension that has impacted many San Franciscans: The power struggle between a new wave of tech workers and older San Franciscans who are being evicted and displaced by them. As they jump back and forth in time, Art (Millie DeBenedet) and Tech (Lindsey Marie Schmeltzer) explore how they initially became good friends but, before long, the inequality of their incomes and judgmental triggers transformed two casual friends into bitter enemies.  With or without a fleet of Google buses, the battle is far from over. * * * * * * * * * * With artistic director Greg MacKellan acting as host and narrator, and company regulars Ryan Drummond, Darlene Popovic, Allison F. Rich, Anil Margsahayam, and Kelly Britt performing solo numbers as well as ensembles, 42nd Street Moon's tribute to Alan Jay Lerner was appropriately entitled Inventing Champagne. The evening's guest star was the venerable Nancy Dussault (whom I first saw when she was appearing as Maria late in the original Broadway run of The Sound of Music and later in Bajour). With Dave Dobrusky acting as musical director, the evening paid tribute to Lerner's big hits (1947's Brigadoon, 1956's My Fair Lady, 1958's Gigi, 1960's Camelot, and 1965's On A Clear Day You Can See Forever). Some interesting twists of gender identity included Darlene Popovic's rendition of ""Get Me to The Church on Time"" (My Fair Lady) and Kelly Britt's surprisingly feminine version of ""I Talk To The Trees"" from 1951's Paint Your Wagon. Lerner's on-again, off-again partnership with Frederick ""Fritz"" Loewe allowed him to work with such giants as Kurt Weill, Burton Lane, André Previn, Charles Strouse, Leonard Bernstein, and John Barry. Even if those efforts did not produce the most memorable hits, I was fascinated by ""I've Been Married"" from 1984's My Man Godfrey (with music by Gerard Kenny) and the droll ""Economics"" from Kurt Weill's Love Life (1948). MacKellan also demonstrated how Lerner recycled some of the songs he wrote with Fritz Loewe after they had been cut from their original shows. Not all of Lerner's shows were smash hits. In the following clip, soprano Meg Bussert sings two songs from Lolita, My Love and discusses some of the problems encountered during that show's out-of-town tryout. MacKellan's narration did not include any mention of Lerner's hospitalization during Camelot's out-of-town tryout. Although the famous lyricist died nearly 30 years ago, he still holds a cherished spot in the hearts of many who worked with him. Here's John Collum (who co-starred with Barbara Harris in the original Broadway cast of On A Clear Day You Can See Forever) recalling the impact Lerner had on his life.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Lynn Nottage’s play “Sweat” has been heralded as the “The First Theatrical Landmark of the Trump Era.” It tells the story of a tight group of working-class people in Reading, Pennsylvania, who ― in the face of layoffs, impending poverty, and the threat of incarceration and drug abuse ― come to terms with their collapsing reality. While the characters relay their experiences in a setting that takes place years before President Donald Trump took office, the play slyly answers a question on the minds of many American voters: How did we get here? (Here, of course, being the “Trump era” of note.) In an interview with The Huffington Post, Nottage announced that she is currently working on a companion piece to her groundbreaking production. “I have another play that’s in conversation with ‘Sweat,’” Nottage explained, when asked about her plans now that “Sweat” is running smoothly after its Broadway debut earlier this month.  According to Playbill, the new play is currently titled “Floyd” and will be a comedy. (”Sweat” is a drama, though it has moments of comedic relief.) Nottage did not provide any further details regarding her companion piece, but she did supply us with a few more future credits to her name. “I have some other projects,” she told HuffPost. “I’m doing an adaptation of ‘Black Orpheus,’ the movie, for the stage with director George Wolf; an adaption of ‘The Secret Life of Bees’ with Duncan Sheik and Susan Birkenhead; and I’ve recently finished an adaptation of my play ‘Intimate Apparel’ as an opera with composer Ricky Ian Gordon.” When pressed on the upcoming companion piece, and how the experience of making “Sweat” influenced Nottage’s practice, she added: It’s made me think much more expansively about why and how I make art and where I want to make it. And the impact that it can have. I don’t have all the answers to those questions, but certainly, being in Reading has challenged me to think about what it is I want to do and why I do it. Nottage’s play, set in 2000 and 2008, has been widely celebrated as an illuminating piece of contemporary art. “The immediacy of it is almost freakish,” MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes told Variety. “I’m not sure how [Nottage] managed it. Not only is it great as drama, in that it’s incredibly well-crafted with well-drawn characters, but it’s also one of the most sophisticated political texts I’ve encountered in a long while.” Read more about “Sweat” here."

POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― Republicans are confirming judges at a breakneck pace and are pushing forward with changes to Senate rules that make it even easier to confirm more of President Donald Trump’s judicial nominees. It’s a tremendously important achievement ― one that is already being called their most enduring legacy. But Democrats who blew up the rules when they were in the majority to make it easier to confirm executive and judicial nominees say they have no regrets about doing so. “It wasn’t a mistake. The mistake is to have people confirm judges that are way out of the mainstream and to refuse to be thoughtful about what we’re going to do the judiciary,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), a lead proponent of filibuster reform at the time, told HuffPost this week. In 2013, under the leadership of then-Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Democrats voted to deploy a parliamentary procedure dubbed the “nuclear option” to change Senate rules to pass most executive and judicial nominees by a simple majority vote, instead of the long-standing 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster. They argued that unprecedented obstruction to then-President Barack Obama’s executive and judicial nominations necessitated the historic change to Senate rules. Republicans were furious, however, warning that Democrats would come to rue abandoning the filibuster on executive and judicial nominees. “I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, you’ll regret this,” then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told them at the time. “And you may regret it a lot sooner than you think.” Now, as majority leader, McConnell is leading the push to reshape the federal bench with mostly young, conservative nominees. The Senate is expected by next week to confirm a total of six circuit court nominees, bringing Trump’s number of circuit court nominees confirmed to 21, after already confirming more nominees to the nation’s appellate courts by a single president in over half a century. All would serve lifetime appointments. “By appointing and confirming these strict constructionists to the courts who are in their late 40s or early 50s ... we’re making a generational change in our country that will be repeated over and over and over down through the years,” McConnell told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt last week. Most Democrats who spoke to HuffPost about their 2013 vote to go nuclear dismissed the notion that they somehow paved the way for Trump’s parade of conservative judges, arguing that the GOP is degrading Senate rules on judicial nominees in other ways. Republicans, for example, have been bending longstanding Senate tradition that allows home-state senators of a nominee to deny or advance their nomination in the Judiciary Committee. The GOP did so again this week, for example, when they confirmed Michael Brennan to be a lifetime judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit over the objection of Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.). Republican senators routinely abused the tradition, known as a “blue slip,” to block Obama’s court picks. And last month, Republicans voted to advance a proposal, authored by Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), that would substantially cut down on the amount of debate time needed for hundreds of nominations ― speeding up the time needed to get them confirmed. “The rules change has nothing to do with it. It’s just pure partisanship,” Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) said, noting that McConnell’s greatest legacy includes denying Obama a hearing on his Supreme Court pick in 2016. Adam Jentleson, a former spokesman for Reid, said his “only regret” was that Democrats didn’t change the rules prior to 2013 which would have given them even more time to confirm Obama nominees. “McConnell was blocking judges at an unprecedented pace and if we hadn’t changed the rules, we would’ve confirmed far fewer Obama judges and there would be far more vacancies right now for Trump to fill, including to important courts like the critical DC Circuit,” he said. But some Democrats said that, in hindsight, the 2013 rules change may not have been such a good idea. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), one of just three Democrats who opposed going nuclear, criticized the former Nevada senator who pushed to change the filibuster rules. “The whole thing is coming apart. We’re just going to become a glorified extension of the House. I blame one guy. I blame Harry Reid,” he said. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), meanwhile, said he thought the decision to change the filibuster rules was “right at the time.” “But in retrospect,” he added, “we might wanna rethink it.”"
ARTS & CULTURE," The sun was up.  A weekday.  Seemed the perfect moment to cycle over to see the new blockbuster exhibit of Diego Velasquez, the 17th century Spanish master whose works are scarcely known in France.   Alas the line on this second day of the exhibit snaked up and down, in and out for what would have taken at least two hours go get inside--even with a press card.  Dejected, we pedaled back toward home beneath the budding chestnuts along Blvd. St. Germain and just happened to glimpse a sign for Latin America House where a much more recent and still more discombobulating Hispanic artist, Carmen Perrin, has a breath-stealing, memory-imploding exhibit of her visual terpsichory. Bolivian by birth, Swiss by education, introspectively silent by character, Perrin zooms in and out of private and collective memory, her creations like a stack of exploding dreams that skate along from the reassuring to the terrifying.

The objects are simple:  layered paper cups painted with tiny images of childhood cartoons, gangster films, the catastrophes of the daily news. Many are also drawn from the foggy zones of high culture turned into pop toys. Those collapsable cups might also be an engine block.  But they are each and all multi-zoned visual games and illusions. The intricacy with which paper cups are joined together and reversed or a children's table converted into metallic crochet, reinforce the architectures of a very personal dreamland, not unlike the shifting-sliding world of Latin magical realism that taught the depleted Cartesians to suspect the surfaces of conventional reason.
 Since her childhood in La Paz, Perrin says, she has been drawn at once to the surfaces of objects--cups, tables, dried petroleum film, sparkling objects in trash heaps from which older stories emerge.  From them she draws us relentlessly into one set of optical illusions after another.

A white, perforated, possibly iron, table and four chairs called Las Chicas recalls the utility and the fragility of ordinary objects, a memory of the Spanish phrase mothers would use to call the kids, las chicas--in her case four sisters--to lunch.  The form is there as it might be of any table in the trash, but the memory of what was served with its colors, flavors and textures has fallen through the holes of memory.
A rectangular box composed of variously colored wires suggests that now mostly abandoned space where Clark Kent turned himself into Superman:  the phone booth, here twisted and tortured and constructed of actual tiny burnt telephone wires, the wires that kids discovered when they ripped apart those old, heavy black handset phones that were once afforded their own small table in proper houses.
A wall of hardened rubber fish mouths, each punctured by a hook, is united by geometric black fishing lines. On the opposite wall an explosion of sparkling jagged colors captures a visitor's eyes and as she moves, the colors keep exploding, unwilling to settle down until she arrives at the extremities, left or right, where it all turns into an undulating surface of grays and browns.

 Similarly, a thoroughly seductive room of tiny painted rods steals the stability of vision: but don't rest too long inside or you might undergo neuro breakdown. The message throughout is simple, borrowed, Perrin says, from both the constructivist and the Art Povera movements:  you cannot escape the presence of provocative, enticing, distressing art, wherever you are if you are willing to question the illusions of life's daily surfaces. all photos by Frank Browning"
POLITICS,"Gina Ortiz Jones won the Democratic nomination for a Texas U.S. House seat on Tuesday, advancing in her bid to make history on several fronts. The former Air Force intelligence officer defeated fellow Democrat Rick Trevino in a runoff after the two were the top finishers in a five-candidate March primary. If she wins in November, Ortiz Jones will be the first lesbian, first Iraq War veteran and first Filipina-American to represent Texas in Congress. The 37-year-old is up against Republican Rep. Will Hurd, 40, in November, and she faces a tough task. The two-term incumbent has a lot more money, and Texas’ 23rd Congressional District leans Republican. But the district has flip-flopped between Democratic and GOP representation in recent years, with nobody holding it for more than two terms since 2007. Hurd won his first term in 2014 by about 2,400 votes against Democratic Rep. Pete Gallego. In a rematch in 2016, Hurd won by about 3,000 votes. Ortiz Jones also benefits from Democrats generally being energized and flooding to the polls in response to Donald Trump’s presidency. In the March primary, more than 44,000 voters cast ballots in Ortiz Jones’ race, compared to about 31,000 voters in Hurd’s race. She told HuffPost in January that she decided to run for office out of frustration with Trump. A career civil servant after her military stint, Ortiz Jones worked under presidents in both parties and said she thought she could continue her service under the Trump administration. She ended up being horrified by his policies and the people he hired for top jobs. “The type of people that were brought in to be public servants were interested in neither the public nor the service,” she said. “That, to me, was a sign that I’m going to have to serve in a different way.”"
POLITICS,"Marco Rubio may have committed the ultimate heresy for a Republican: The senator from Florida admitted that recent corporate tax cuts are doing little to help American workers and that increased public spending might be in order. In an interview with the Economist, Rubio said he doubts that the tax cuts or Trump’s “America first” protectionism will stop people from losing their jobs to automation.  “There is still a lot of thinking on the right that if big corporations are happy, they’re going to take the money they’re saving and reinvest it in American workers,” he said. “In fact, they bought back shares, a few gave out bonuses; there’s no evidence whatsoever that the money’s been massively poured back into the American worker.” Rubio also threw cold water on Trump’s stated promise to bring back manufacturing jobs to the U.S. “I have no problem with bringing back American car-manufacturing facilities, but, whether they’re American robots or Mexican robots, they’re going to be highly automated,” he explained. But Rubio really risks alienating the GOP with some of the solutions he is proposing to help the country because they involve ― cue the horror movie screams ― public spending. The senator suggests spending more tax dollars on programs focused on technological research and on education programs prioritizing vocational skills. “Government has an essential role to play in buffering this transition,” he said. “If we basically say everyone is on their own and the market’s going to take care of it, we will rip the country apart, because millions of good, hardworking people lack the means to adapt.” "

POLITICS,"A California Republican candidate for U.S. Senate who praises Adolf Hitler and believes Jewish representation in government should be limited was booted from the state’s GOP convention on Saturday. Patrick Little hopes to become the Republican candidate to face off against Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who’ll be running for a fifth term in the fall. In a SurveyUSA poll last month, Feinstein was backed by 39 percent of the people surveyed in the poll while Little came in second place at 18 percent. State GOP spokesman Matt Fleming told CBS News that Little has never been active in Republican politics. He added that the GOP condemns “anti-Semitism and any other form of religious bigotry.” In a video posted on BitChute, Little railed against his ejection while standing ― and spitting ― on an Israeli flag. He called participants in the GOP convention “zionist stooges.” The 33-year-old IT engineer is a Marine veteran who served in Afghanistan. He describes himself as a “white advocate” who aims to “crush ... anti-white racism in U.S. institutions,” and has called Hitler “one of the greatest leaders in history.” Little’s campaign slogan is: “Liberate the U.S. from the Jewish oligarchy.”  Last month, Little protested outside Twitter headquarters in San Francisco after the company suspended his account. He held a sign that read: “It’s not okay to be white @ Twitter.” Two counter-protesters flanked him, one holding a sign with an arrow pointing at Little and the message: “Fuck this white supremacist.”  Little told a reporter from KPIX-5 TV that Twitter was “run” by the Jewish Anti-Defamation League and that he wanted to debate if the Holocaust happened. “Oh, the Holocaust happened, Patrick Little,” the reporter told him (see video above).  The primary is June 5."

ARTS & CULTURE,"Ralph Waldo Emerson once said that ""beauty without expression is boring"", and as someone who has to create images with the right expression, this quote nails it.   Whenever I photograph a model, getting the right expression from them is absolutely critical to the final image, but I don't hear many people talking about it or it's importance and I'd like to do that today. Expression helps tell the story, and it's useful for all of us to become a little more aware of our own expressions (and the messages they give out!). I would define expression as the mood and emotion told through the face as well as through body language.  Getting the expression right in fashion photography is so important because expression allows us to tell the story through the images being created. It gives feeling, emotion and life to the image. As fashion photographers, particularly for editorial work, we are always looking to tell a story, often one of fantasy and make believe so getting this communicated through our images is really essential. To tell the story that we're shooting, there has to be the right type of emotion to convey the mood of the photo. If it's lacking, or not portraying the right sort of mood, then the right story will have difficulty being told, simply because the right emotion won't be felt through the image.  The facial expression and pose have to flow seamlessly in order to convey a natural mood and not to look forced. If the models pose is right but the expression is wrong, the tone of the image doesn't flow and it will end up confusing the viewer. A model might have beautiful soft movement, with pretty clothing for instance, but if her expression is one of frustration, or if she looks angry, then the photo won't work. The general principle is that strong, fierce expressions work with strong poses, and softer expressions with more natural, whimsical, and softer posing.   One area of challenge in fashion photography can be to get a model that might not have a huge range in her expressions, to get the look or expression I'm trying to draw out.  Generally, I'll tell the model the mood of the shoot and the concept we are going for before we even think about starting the shoot. It's very important for a model to know this, and to think about it, as they'll generally have worked with many different photographers, looking for different emotions and very different looks and styles for each shoot.    A model may be use to doing very strong, fierce expressions for more edgy looks, but when you are looking for something more soft, whimsical or playful, it's critical to express this to the model before the shoot, and work with them throughout, to keep the mood flowing and the right emotion coming through. In many ways I imagine it's similar to how a director would work with actors on a stage or a film production - my role is not just to click a shutter and make images, but to ensure the right mood and feeling comes through while we're on set.  One thing I've realized as a professional photographer is that how we express ourselves, through our body language and facial expression directly relates to how we are perceived by those around us. Working with models and having to draw the right expression from them reminds me of this day to day. The smallest micro-expression such as a small smile, or crossing your arms, can really play a big role in how you are perceived.

POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― Congress sent a bill to President Donald Trump’s desk Tuesday intended to roll back regulations adopted after the 2008 financial crisis, weakening consumer protection and modestly increasing the risk of another banking collapse. The bill’s passage marks the second major legislative victory for both Trump and the financial sector, following last year’s tax cut. The package will benefit banks both large and small, limit consumer remedies against credit reporting agencies including the scandal-plagued Equifax, curb the government’s ability to collect data on racial discrimination in the housing market, and allow large regional banks to rely on more risky debt to finance their operations. Tuesday’s 258-159 House vote came as banks are posting record profits thanks to a stronger economy and lower tax rates. The U.S. banking industry posted a combined $56 billion profit in the first quarter of 2018, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, its best three-month stint in history. Community banks ― smaller institutions in rural parts of the country that proponents of the bill claimed were in need of particular aid ― also posted billions in net profits. Nevertheless, banks still need deregulation, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said. “Big banks keep getting bigger,” Cole told HuffPost on Tuesday. “Small banks are being regulated out of existence.” With Republicans in control of the House, the bill’s eventual approval was a fait accompli after 17 Senate Democrats voted for it in March.  The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law included a host of consumer protections and risk management rules that apply to all banks. But it applied tougher rules to the largest banks, since the failure of a large firm can have dire consequences for the broader economy. Banks with at least $50 billion in assets have to undergo frequent stress-testing by the Federal Reserve to determine whether they could withstand an unexpected financial shock. They must finance their operations with more capital and less borrowed money, and they have to keep more cash on hand.  The bill approved Tuesday would change the definition of what constitutes the biggest banks, freeing banks with up to $250 billion in assets from these tougher rules. Huge regional players like BB&T and SunTrust would be exempted, as would foreign conglomerates with trillions of dollars in global assets ― like Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and UBS ― that keep less than $250 billion of their assets in the United States. “Clearly the distress or failure of some of these banks could trigger reactions spreading broadly to the financial system,” former Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker wrote in a letter to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who voted against the legislation. Volcker in particular highlighted the risks posed by curtailing oversight of “several large foreign banks,” suggesting that a $100 billion threshold would be more appropriate. When the Congressional Budget Office analyzed the legislation in March, it concluded that while the risk of another banking crash in any specific year was small, the odds “would be slightly greater under the legislation.” The risk would be worth making it easier for small and intermediate-sized banks to provide credit, Rep. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), a senior member of the House financial services committee, said Tuesday. “Everything in life is a balancing act.” Banking analysts also expect large regional banks to acquire more small community lenders as a result of the bill, since they will not be penalized with tougher regulations for growing past the $50 billion mark. The subprime mortgage crisis revealed that banks had systematically steered families of color into expensive, predatory loans. Dodd-Frank sought to address this in part by requiring lenders to report a host of data to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In addition to basic facts about loan approval or denial, lenders had to report a borrower’s age and credit score, as well as the property value of the home being purchased, the interest rate, loan terms, and other pricing features of each mortgage. The CFPB could use all of this data to determine whether families of color were being improperly overcharged or pushed into bad loans.  The bill approved Tuesday would exempt 85 percent of banks from those new anti-discrimination reporting requirements, in an effort to save paperwork costs. A host of civil rights organizations, including the NAACP, the National Fair Housing Alliance, the National Urban League and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, have all assailed the provision. The bill also contains several provisions that are supposed to benefit consumers, such as by requiring credit monitoring firms to let people freeze their credit reports, which contain personal financial information that companies like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion collect without prior consent. Equifax proved a poor custodian of that information last year when the company announced hackers had stolen personal data relating to more than 140 million Americans. Consumer advocates say the supposed benefits are actually a mixed bag, because some provisions would preempt more generous state laws and others could prevent consumers from joining class-action lawsuits.  One provision is a straightforward giveaway to Equifax and its ilk, since it would force government-backed mortgage companies to consider using their credit-scoring algorithm as part of the home lending process. Liberal and conservative groups alike, as well as other housing finance stakeholders, oppose the provision.  Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), another member of the House financial services committee, dismissed concerns about restricting consumers from being able to join class-action lawsuits, noting that they can still settle disputes by arbitration. “You’re choosing to focus on one of the credit rating agencies,” he told HuffPost when asked how the bill would affect Equifax. “I think that goes far beyond the very narrow focus that you’re taking on it. Consumers should always have remedies for bad actors, always.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,"Living in London and being a photographer is one of the greatest things in my life. Having moved from a small town in Kent, London has always excited me and after 5 years in the city I still have the same excitement as when i first moved here.

ENTERTAINMENT,"Khloé Kardashian is opening up about why she decided to name her daughter True. The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star reveals on her app that while the moniker is a family name, it wasn’t Kris Jenner who came up with it. “Picking a name for your child is really so tough!” Kardashian begins. “I knew I wanted my baby to have a ‘T’ initial, so one night while we were all at dinner, thinking of some names, my grandma, M.J., suggested True.” She continued, “She told me it was my great-grandfather’s first name and my grandfather’s middle name. It stuck with me for my entire pregnancy and was the only one I couldn’t get out of my head. I love that it’s a family name, and I can’t wait to get back to L.A. so True can finally meet M.J. in person!” Kardashian gave birth to her baby girl one month ago, just days after it was revealed boyfriend Tristan Thompson had been unfaithful multiple times while she was pregnant. However, the two are still very much together and working through it, sources tell Yahoo Entertainment. Although the reality star celebrated her first Mother’s Day without Thompson — but with baby True, of course — she shared on social media that she felt “so loved.” Thompson was on the road in Boston, as the Cleveland Cavaliers took on the Celtics in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. Kardashian stayed in Ohio, opting not to return to Los Angeles, where the majority of her famous family celebrated on Sunday. Over the weekend, Kardashian shared the first photos of her little girl on social media. She also clapped back at haters commenting about True’s appearance. “Her daughter is Black which proves that O.J. Simpson is Khloé’s dad,” one person commented. Kardashian replied, “I mean… her dad is black silly. That’s why she’s black babe.” True closely resembles her father — even Kardashian agrees. Everyone tells me they are identical lol it’s wild maybe her eyes will stay light and I can get something lol Tristan and True are twins lol it’s crazy Read more from Yahoo Entertainment: This post was originally published on Yahoo Entertainment."
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) withdrew her cosponsorship of immigration legislation that would help young undocumented immigrants, as she fends off challenges from the right in her bid for her party’s Senate nomination. McSally has been a cosponsor of the Recognizing America’s Children Act (RAC) since April of 2017. On Thursday, she asked to be removed as a cosponsor. The GOP-sponsored bill ― which has one Democratic supporter ― would give legal status to certain young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and are often called Dreamers.  McSally is in a tight race for her party’s Senate nomination for the open seat being vacated by GOP Sen. Jeff Flake. The congresswoman has the backing of party leaders, but her opponents in the primary include conservative favorite Kelli Ward, who has the support of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), former White House aide Steve Bannon and right-wing pundits Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham.  Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, another right-wing darling for his harsh opposition to undocumented immigration, is also in the race.  McSally spokeswoman Kelly Schibi said the congresswoman “wanted to clarify which legislative solution she backs wholeheartedly” ― a bill she co-authored that does not include a path to citizenship for Dreamers and would dramatically overhaul the immigration system. The bill, Securing America’s Future Act, would cut legal immigration, criminalize being in the U.S. without authorization and dramatically increase spending for border security and enforcement of immigration laws throughout the country. It would create a non-immigrant status for Dreamers that could be renewed indefinitely but wouldn’t provide a way for them to become citizens. Referring to McSally as the “lead author and champion” of the legislation, Schibi noted that the White House backs the bill. McSally’s abandonment of he RAC Act seems an indication that she is responding to Ward’s attacks from the right. Ward has been criticizing McSally for supporting “amnesty.” In an interview last month on Fox News, Ward said McSally has flip-flopped on immigration and is only lately acting like a conservative. “Her record is clear: she voted to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants, said a border wall will not work, ‘proudly’ voted for wasteful government spending, and refuses to say if she voted for President Trump. As a result, she has lost the trust of conservatives in Arizona,” Ward said in response to the news that former Gov. Jan Brewer (R) was endorsing McSally.  Ward and her backers point to McSally’s votes against amendments that would have helped end programs that provide protections for young undocumented immigrants, among other examples. McSally’s campaign, in response, has pointed to the lawmaker’s support to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities and increase border security. McSally has noticeably shifted to the right as she seeks her party’s Senate nomination. During the 2016 campaign and in the early days of his presidency, she was critical of Donald Trump. She called his comments on the “Access Hollywood” tape “disgusting,” and expressed frustration at having to answer for every little distraction he created.  But the video for her Senate candidacy announcement in January featured praise she’s received from the president.  The RAC Act was introduced by Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) as a GOP  alternative to the Dream Act. It would allow certain undocumented young people who came to the U.S. before they turned 16 to gain conditional permanent residency, as long as they stayed in school or had a job and met other requirements. It has 34 Republican backers, most of whom are moderates or represent Latino-heavy districts.  Curbelo on Wednesday filed a discharge petition, which allows members to bring a bill to the floor without leadership’s consent, that could force a vote on four immigration bills, including two that would offer a path to citizenship for Dreamers. The petition needs 218 signatures ― a majority of the House ― and already has 18 Republican signatories, along with one Democrat. It’s expected to win support from most, if not all, of the 193-member Democratic caucus.  McSally has not signed the discharge petition.  Shifting to the right may have its benefits in the primary campaign, but it could be difficult for McSally to sprint back to the center if she emerges as the GOP Senate nominee. Part of that problem involves timing ― Arizona’s Aug. 28 is one of the latest in the nation. The Republican nominee is expected to face Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, the only Democrat signed on as a cosponsor of the RAC Act. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"George R.R. Martin was just 26 when he won the Hugo Award for Best Novella, an impressive feat for such a young writer. But he was published in print over a decade before that ― in the fan mail section of “Fantastic Four #17.” In an upcoming History channel documentary about comics, Martin says that this letter was the first time his writing appeared in print.  In a post about the letter, Entertainment Weekly notes that the “A Song of Ice and Fire” author shows an early penchant for unexpected plot twists, a staple of his own writing.  “In what other comic mag could you see things like a hero falling down a manhole,” Martin wrote. He continued to shower the issue with effusive praise:  “You were just about the World’s worst mag when you started, but you set yourself to an ideal, and, by gumbo, you achieved it! More than achieved it, in fact ― why, if you were only half as good as you are now, you’d still be the world’s best mag!!!” Read the entire letter below:"
BUSINESS,"President Trump believes that Federal regulation is excessive and has directed that task forces be set up at each Federal agency to supervise and monitor the process of finding regulations to cut. To my knowledge, he has not provided any guidance to the agencies on how to do this, so I decided to do it for him in this article.  Step 1: Define the Objective: Counting the number of regulations is useless, what matters is whether the objectives of regulation are being achieved. Regulation is excessive when it does not accomplish its objective, or when the cost of accomplishing the objective through regulation is excessive, or when there is an alternative to regulation that is less costly. The objectives vary from agency to agency. My interest is in financial regulation. This includes the market for home mortgages, which I will use for my illustrations. The agencies with regulatory responsibilities in this market include HUD/FHA, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I will illustrate with two objectives, both of which are designed to empower the “little guy.” 1.    Reduce barriers to effective mortgage shopping. 2.    Reduce mortgage transactions costs. Step 2:  Identify Remediable Deficiencies The major focus of the agencies in assessing their regulations should be to identify the major deficiencies that are preventing their objectives from being realized.  For the mortgage-related agencies, Step 2 would include the following deficiencies bearing on the two objectives cited above. 1.  Lender control of appraisals makes them non-portable and lengthens transaction periods, both of which impede the ability of borrowers to shop effectively. 2.  The cost of title insurance paid by borrowers is excessive relative to the costs incurred in assessing the validity of titles. Step 3: Assess Existing and Alternative Regulations I will illustrate with the two objectives and deficiencies cited above. The Difficulty in Shopping: The core problem potential borrowers face in shopping for a mortgage is that critically important information bearing on its price, including the value of the property, is not available to them until after they have applied for a loan and paid for an appraisal. For a borrower to withdraw at this point in order to begin again with another lender is difficult, costly and time-consuming, so few do it. Relevant Existing Regulations: The regulations applicable to appraisals are a major source of the problem. While borrowers pay for appraisals, the regulations place responsibility and control with lenders, who order them after a borrower has applied. This lengthens the period the borrower must wait for the information needed to shop, and it also means that the borrower who withdraws from the process must pay for a new appraisal and wait out the results once again. A Better Regulatory Approach: If regulations obliged lenders to accept an appraisal ordered by a borrower from any approved appraisal management company, the borrower would at last have the capacity to shop for the best deal. With an appraisal in hand, the shopper could invite multiple lenders to make a firm offer at a specified date and time. Making appraisals portable is one of the simplest and most effective ways to empower consumers. Bringing that about would require replacement of one set of regulations with another set. The Excessive Price of Title Insurance: Assuring good title is necessary for an effective housing and mortgage market, but title insurance is not necessary for that purpose. Denmark has a reliable system of recording titles but no title insurance. Relevant Existing Law: Existing law allows lenders to shift to the borrower the cost of title insurance that protects the lender. This prevents the efficient application of existing technology that would reduce the cost of assuring good titles to a small fraction of the cost of title insurance. The problem is that lenders have no financial incentive to shift to a more efficient system – in fact, many have a financial interest in the title agencies to which they refer customers. A Better Regulatory Approach: If the law required lenders to pay for title insurance themselves, passing the cost to the borrower in the price of the mortgage, lenders would have an incentive to drive down the cost rather than to share in the revenue. The result would be a precipitous decline in the cost of title insurance, and eventually the replacement of the industry with an automated system open to all market participants. If this new and very simple regulation applied to mortgage insurance as well as title insurance, which should be the case, it would make a large set of existing regulations obsolete. These are the regulations that apply to referral fees, which deal with such weighty matters as whether a birthday present from a title agent or a mortgage insurance salesperson, to a lender, constitutes a prohibited referral fee. Good riddance. Concluding Comment The President says he wants to reduce the number of regulations.  I interpret that to mean that he wants to replace regulations that are directed toward worthy objectives but don’t work with regulations that do work, and I have given some examples. Regulations that ought to be scrapped rather than replaced will be discussed in another article.   For more information on mortgages or to shop for a mortgage in an unbiased environment, visit my website The Mortgage Professor"
POLITICS,"Before Michael Cohen paid off a porn star to hush up, he apparently tried to get Seth Meyers to speak up. Meyers told Politico in a story posting on Tuesday that after he roasted Donald Trump ― among others ― at the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, he reached out a few years later to invite the soon-to-be-presidential candidate to appear on his “Late Night” talk show. But Trump set one non-negotiable condition for his appearance ― that Meyers apologize on air for his 2011 remarks. And the would-be world leader had his personal attorney Cohen relay the terms. That’s where the conversation ended, according to Meyers. In an interview for a Politico podcast, Meyers said he “would have never” issued such an apology. And to think that Meyers and Trump appeared together as father and son in a skit on “Saturday Night Live” in 2004. Meyers’ monologue at the annual correspondents’ dinner, with some barbs perhaps as sharp as Michelle Wolf’s 2018 bit that prompted Trump to call her “filthy,” included this one: “Donald Trump has been saying he will run for president as a Republican, which is surprising, since I just assumed he was running as a joke.” Trump sat expressionless as Meyers riffed on him. And Trump associates have since speculated that the gibes played a role in his eventual decision to seek the presidency. Meyers and Trump having a sit-down could be a magical talk-show moment. Asked during the podcast whether it still might happen, Meyers replied, “It’s never going to happen.” He said there’s a theory in the world of comedic talk shows that there’s a good interview with Trump waiting to happen. “I don’t think there is,” Meyers said, adding that an attempt to capture that would be like “trying to tackle a shadow.” Still, he conceded that if Trump “called and said he wanted to be on the show, I’d have to say yes.” Neither Cohen nor the White House immediately responded to HuffPost requests for comment."
ENTERTAINMENT,"The boys club is alive and well in Hollywood ― and it’s so entrenched that male celebrities will unwittingly go on the record about it.  This week a New York Times interview with the “Arrested Development” cast went viral after matriarch Jessica Walter opened up about how her co-star Jeffrey Tambor (who was also present during the interview) used to verbally abuse her on set. In a stunning, but wholly unsurprising, turn of events, her other male co-stars jumped in ... on behalf of Tambor. Jason Bateman suggested that Tambor’s behavior occurred in part because the cast was like a “family,” suggesting that the entertainment industry was simply a “breeding ground for atypical behavior and certain people have certain processes.”  The backlash was swift, and Bateman and co-star Tony Hale have since publicly apologized for not supporting Walter during the interview. And the conversation raised a few questions: Are all sets truly “breeding grounds for atypical behavior,” including verbal assaults? Is that simply the cost of creating art? To find out, we asked Vella Lovell, a 32-year-old actress who has spent her fair share of time on TV sets ― specifically the set of “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” a CW show on which she has played Heather over the last few years. Lovell isn’t part of Hollywood’s old boys club, though she is certainly part of Hollywood. Much of her career has been spent on sets run by and/or dominated by women ― “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” “Younger,” “Girls.” She’s been working for years, but is also young enough to imagine that her work culture could be different than what Bateman described. “It maybe has been the norm,” she told HuffPost over the phone while doing her grocery shopping, reacting to Bateman’s characterization of the industry she’s a part of, “but as tides are turning, it’s kind of like, if there’s an alternative, what are we doing?” When you first read that New York Times interview, what was your reaction? It seemed like the women [Jessica Walter and Alia Shawkat] didn’t get to talk a lot. It seemed like the guys kind of took over the interview and I think that’s part of the problem. It didn’t seem like [Walter] felt heard ― just from that article. So that says to me that it’s not an equal playing field ... I think that can happen a lot with women and men in creative fields ― women can end up feeling a little silenced.  From your perspective, does the set dynamic that Jason Bateman described as typical of the entertainment industry ring true to you? Is that something you’ve experienced ― verbal altercations that might cross a line into feeling abusive? The set I’ve spent the most time on is “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” and it’s run all by women. Honestly, I’ve never experienced that, so I would have to say no. But I also think that all the women on set set a precedent. And I think it’s up to the people at the top to set that vibe and example of what is acceptable and what’s not. I will say, just being in the theater and on sets, the more power someone has, the more things are dictated by them. Whoever the number-one person is on the set kind of sets the tone. It’s their behavior and their moral center that dictates how the set is gonna be. So for us, because it’s Rachel [Bloom] and because she’s a creator, the respect is kind of implied.  But I think that [verbal abuse] can happen, especially with the older men generation. They’re used to a certain amount of power and respect. And so because they’re the person in power, I do think the younger actors ― even if it’s just younger in your career ― you end up looking up to them as the norm. Does that make sense? I think that’s maybe what [Jason Bateman] is saying [in The New York Times piece], that it’s become the norm.  Let me read you exactly what Bateman said to Sopan Deb. He said: “Again, not to belittle it or excuse it or anything, but in the entertainment industry it is incredibly common to have people who are, in quotes, ‘difficult.’... And what you learn is context. And you learn about character and you learn about work habits, work ethics, and you start to understand. Because it’s a very amorphous process, this sort of [expletive] that we do, you know, making up fake life. It’s a weird thing, and it is a breeding ground for atypical behavior and certain people have certain processes.” OK, Emma, if you could see me right now, I’m just shaking my head. I just feel like what’s been the “norm,” isn’t actually acceptable. And I have met, in my short time on sets, too many people who are kind and respectful and inclusive for that to be acceptable. And that’s the thing ― it maybe has been the norm, but as tides are turning, it’s kind of like, if there’s an alternative, what are we doing?  There are too many incredibly talented creative people that are also kind. I’ve met so many of those people. And you meet them, and then you’re like, so why then do I need to be verbally abused to get a great performance? Do those things actually go hand in hand? And I don’t think they need to.  I think it’s probably true that someone with [Jeffrey Tambor’s] stature comes on set and dictates how people will be treated. As a younger actor, you’re just like, sure ... and then that behavior becomes the norm. But it’s just not OK.  I loved that Alia Shawkat pointed that out in the middle of the interview. “But that doesn’t mean it’s acceptable,” she said in response to Bateman. “And the point is that things are changing, and people need to respect each other differently.” Right? But you hear that [argument] with all of the things that are happening [with Me Too]. With Dustin Hoffman, they’re like, no but this is normal. And it’s like… but why? Why does it have to be? And I think it’s been an accepted exchange ― that for an amazing performance, you put up with bad behavior. But I don’t think that means it’s right or that it’s how every set is at all. Right. From what you’ve said it sounds like that hasn’t been your experience, and you’ve been working on a network TV show that’s been on for three years.  Yeah. And guest-starring on other sets. On the “Younger” set, because Sutton Foster’s number one, everyone is happy to be there and grateful. People set the tone. And so it depends who the power players are on set. If you were to experience some sort of verbal abuse on a set, who would you go to to talk about that? Well it depends what your role is. If you’re a guest star and you came on set and someone yelled at you, you have less authority than if someone came on to your show. But definitely the producers, the showrunner, the ADs [assistant directors] ― there are so many people there to protect you and make sure that things are OK.  If you weren’t getting the answers from your set, I guess you could go to your union rep. But I think usually your producers would want to help you. But then again, it depends on what the situation is. And I honestly feel that since a year ago, or whenever the [Me Too] stuff started coming out, people are more responsive.  So you feel like there’s been a shift that you’ve witnessed in the last seven months of this national dialogue around sexual harassment and assault? Yeah. Because people know that it’s not just going into a vacuum. There is room for dialogue now because of the platform that’s happening.  The calculation that you spoke of ― this idea that you put up with horrible behavior because someone’s talented. Do you think that same latitude is offered to women and people of color? I don’t know. I don’t think it’s just exclusive to white men. I think it’s dependent on the person. And sometimes because people are talented and genius, their behavior gets excused and they get into positions of power and no one is calling them out. It’s a lot about power, so it can happen across the board. Obviously it’s mostly white men, because that’s usually who’s in power.  Also, the entertainment industry is so relationship-based. There is a casualness built in, which seems to allow people more easily to brush potentially violating behaviors off as just joking around.  Yeah, I think that’s where that fine line is that gets really tricky. If you’re with a group of people for a long time who are creative artists, hopefully there is an understood sense of respect for each other and honor. And so some of those boundaries go down because you all trust each other, and you think a joke is a joke, and ultimately everyone is on the same page. And that’s best-case scenario: You all trust each other, you’re all there for each other, and then amazing creative things can happen. And people’s impulses are free and accepted. But then there’s that fine line, where someone, it can be just one person, doesn’t hold that respect and crosses a boundary. And then the lines get really blurry and confusing. And it’s so complicated because everyone wants that creative freedom. But respect has to be the baseline. One person thinks that they can do or say something that isn’t said with love or respect, and then all of a sudden you’re like, “I don’t feel safe anymore.” It’s such a fine line and I think it has to do with checking your privilege and actually respecting each other. I think that’s what’s underneath everything.  This interview has been edited and condensed."

LA-Like: An Interview With Zoe Crosher With an exhibition that just opened at the new Hollywood home of not-for-profit art initiative LAXART, MutualArt checked in with Los Angeles-based artist Zoe Crosher to discuss her two recently unveiled projects, on view until October 24th, including LA-LIKE: Prospecting Palm Fronds and LA-LIKE: Escaped Exotics.  Zoe crosher, ""LA-LIKE: Prospecting Palm Fronds,"" 2015, installation view at LAXART, Los Angeles, CA. Courtesy of Zoe Crosher. Photo: Chris Adler. Sarah Murkett: A lot of your work deals with disappearances and your current project LA-LIKE: Prospecting Palm Fronds is no different. Can you briefly explain the history of palm trees in LA and what is happening to them, which will inevitably lead to their eradication in the city? Zoe Crosher: It's an amazing crisis that Los Angeles has on its hands--many of the palm trees that dot the landscape and have come to iconically symbolize Southern California are nearing the end of their natural lifespan and are literally dying/disappearing. Planted in the 1930s as part of the boosterism craze, these ornamental, non-native and disastrously water demanding trees, which neither provide shade nor fruit, will not be replanted once they finally go. Running at an unaffordable $20K a pop to replace, Los Angeles County will be planting the more affordable native oaks instead. Imagine the LA landscape not dotted by the ever-present palm tree?  Zoe Crosher, ""LA-LIKE: Prospecting Palm Fronds,"" 2015, installation view at LAXART, Los Angeles, CA. Courtesy of Zoe Crosher. Photo: Chris Adler. SM: Your projects often mine history both real and manufactured. How does your work relate to documentary practices? ZC: I'm extremely interested in the schism of documentary--the hiccup between the presumption of truth and what that reality actually is. My practice is fed by this confusion; something I engage with called the imaginary, upending the assumption of truth in documentary, which I believe is impossible to locate. History is problematized by the presumption of truth that documentary work presumes, told from a privileged position--the notion that there is any singular truth is a complete fiction, and defines the problem of history. History is, fundamentally, misremembering--it is gleaned from what one is told, what one reads, what one learns and watches in film, not from what one experiences. Employing strategies such as captioning, repetition, volume and duration, my work explores how the reality of experiences is more like a satellite structure, looking at a particular situation (the hotel spaces around the LAX airport, sites where various figures, fictional and real, have disappeared along the edge of the Pacific, the auto-portraiture of Michelle duBois) from as many different viewpoints and strategies of dislocation as possible, eschewing any sort of singular reading.  Zoe Crosher, ""LA-LIKE: Prospecting Palm Fronds,"" 2015, installation view at LAXART, Los Angeles, CA. Courtesy of Zoe Crosher. Photo: Chris Adler. SM: You come out of the Photography and Integrated Media program at CalArts and as I understand it you consider these bronze sculptures of palm fronds, which serve as a conceptual mapping of Los Angeles, to be part of an expanded understanding of your photographic practice. Can you explain how sculptures can be considered photographic? ZC: A critical element to the new sculptural work that I'm doing is that these are unique pieces specifically made with a lost wax process--which means that the original raw organic object is actually destroyed in the process and replaced with, in this case, bronze. There is a way in which the actual replacement of the object being documented relates to the intentions of documentary photography, but I'm not sure what the proper term is--it isn't index, it is more a stand-in somehow, a facsimile or relief of the ""real,"" a more physicalized way of recording something that is or that ""happened."" The traditional intention of photography to ""represent the real"" gets taken to a more expanded realm when the actual object being documented is actually used and replaced in that process of documentation, if that makes sense. This work is inspired by a photographic impulse, a documentary impulse even, but it no longer needs to exist within a photographic realm. In a term I've created, the Imagiatic (as opposed to the Photographic), the medium doesn't really matter--the imaginary, the image, all the intangible ideas that traditionally lived within photography as a representational medium, no longer need to be bound by them. Thus the bronzed palm fronds--these ephemeral objects that are disappearing almost overnight, cast in a material that lasts forever--still solidly sits within my conceptual realm of misremembered mapping of the imaginary of Los Angeles, is informed by a documentary impulse, has a bizarre relation to the Real, but is no longer bound by the photographic.

SM: Works from another recent project, LA-LIKE: Escaped Exotics, are also on view at LAXART.  This series is the product of a residency you did at Lotusland Gardens in Montecito, CA. Can you tell us about this project? ZC: This is an amazing new residency program that a writer called Yasmine Moseheni recently organized at Lotusland, a nonprofit botanical garden that opened to the public in 1993. Built by the eccentric and incredible Madame Ganna Walska, a well-known Polish opera singer and socialite, the estate was purchased in 1941 whereby Madame (as she is known) spent the next forty-three years creating her ""collection"" of exotic plants. In the 1970s she even sold a million dollars of her jewelry to buy very rare cycad plants. As I have been thinking a lot about gardens and how they related to notions of collecting and the archive (see my recent billboard project with LAND)--fighting entropy and decay, trying to organize the impossible, etc.--it seemed a perfect fit. Originally I was going to speak with their botanical curator about palm trees, but after visiting the residency, I decided instead to focus on capturing the plant's incredible last hurrah, or swan song burst, before the plant ceases to exist. I have cast the reproductive elements of exotic plants from the collection that blossom prior to the end of their life cycle, preserving the ephemeral--and in some case rare and endangered--plant matter into bronze sculptures. This is a project still in formation, but an important note that I am only bronzing the blossoms from this particular garden, as it is very specifically caught up with the notions of disappearance that I am interested in. This disappearance lends itself to the impossibility of the archive and mapping that Jorge Luis Borges describes in his ""Exactitude of Science"" as the Ludic fallacy, mistaking the model/map for the reality/territory--I'd love to bronze every single blossom that comes out of the garden, from the smallest to the largest...

SM: Another interest of yours is the city of Los Angeles itself. Since the Pacific Standard Time initiative launched in 2011 more people are interested in this history. How do you think the art scene in Los Angeles has changed in the last five years? ZC: Los Angeles is learning to remember, not to forget itself! Part of my love affair with Los Angeles has been its own history of forgetting, as Norman Klein would say, and this recent return to boosterism and self-mythologizing is getting in the way of the wonderful ephemerality that defines so much of this city. I'm afraid it is no longer a city I can get lost in the way I used to. And the rents are going up astronomically.

ARTS & CULTURE,"The Tondo or circular format in painting and relief sculpture has been around for centuries. When researched, you will find examples of masterworks by Botticelli and Michelangelo in Renaissance times, to Damien Hirst’s Spin paintings in more recent times, and what will inevitably become clear is the fact that this type has both the staying power and the diversity to meet the aesthetic challenges of any age. What I find particularly demanding, being an artist myself, is how difficult it is to maximize the focused force of a circular composition. Artists are most used to the square or rectangle canvases that can suggest either a portrait or landscape just in the way one uses it. The Tondo is a completely different situation. There is one endless side. And as a format, it has a much more focused configuration that has less to do with incorporating a background and more to do with presenting a subject. For this exhibition at the Walter Wickiser Gallery in NYC, I have selected seven artists who approach the Tondo configuration in new and challenging ways that greatly expand the field. Laurel Garcia Colvin’s What’s a Girl to Do, I Can’t Believe I’m Still Protesting this Shit, Tondo series (2014) focuses her attention of socio-political, feminist related issues that are truly meant to open eyes. Her vision, her agenda and her technical prowess culminate in a potent narrative that will surely force reaction regardless of which side of the aisle you stand on. Created in 2014, her art is more meaningful now than ever, as our nation’s politics and policies are sadly being bent backwards, but hopefully not breaking, under our new administration.  Alexis Duque’s Disk (2015) melds abstraction with representation to create an intricate menagerie of hypnotic forms and hazy functions. Duque’s work is about the multiplicity of thoughts and ideas that somehow coalesce into a working system. But look closely, see every little detail and all the nuance, and you will begin to sense an endless, continual consciousness with no beginning or end. Life, like anything else, is a cycle, and with each generation comes the next learning curve. The only thing that grows is the mountain of debris. Karen Fitzgerald sees the Tondo as a chance to “convey an essence of interconnection, wholeness and metaphysical purpose.” And surely, her intention comes through the moment you see her work as your spirit rises and your thoughts move to a better understanding of the universe as both a micro and macro phenomenon. All natural elements are equally important, and everything is universal in its makeup. One of the things I find most fascinating about Fitzgerald’s work is the focus of her vision through the finesse in her technique.  Renee Magnanti combines bold patterning with a suggestion of spirituality in her distinctive, colorful and highly textured encaustic reliefs. In looking at her work, you will get a sense of both Eastern and Western aesthetics as your eyes travel across seductive iconic forms shaped by cut-away caverns of color. Above all, there is a reverence for design in nature – how it stirs in us an understanding of the timeless powers that are greater than our own, while we are reminded of the uncomplicated splendor of life and culture.  The multi-media Tondi of Creighton Michael express the subconscious connection between human impulse and the language of technology. As we struggle to find a comfort zone with an ever-changing world, a cerebral transformation must occur that may conflict with our instincts. Michael smoothes those transitional moments with a mix of sinuous pours over cryptic patterns balancing them like yin and yang. As a result, this ‘complementary’ pairing forms a universal aesthetic that crosses boundaries, making what was once awkward elevated.  Margaret Roleke’s mixed media work puts a dark spin on the state of the world. She reveals, that from a very early age, we are brainwashed, to some extent, to act and think a certain way through fear tactics and false comfort zones. By combining cute Disney imagery with objects of war and aggression, Roleke reveals how pervasive and long standing this approach to social governing is. I am reminded of a quote by Noam Chomsky: “The United States is unusual among the industrial democracies in the rigidity of the system of ideological control – ‘indoctrination’, we might say – exercised through mass media.”  Zane York’s hyperrealism is both magical and mesmerizing. The intense and relentless detail in his paintings and drawings is softened by a highly perceptive touch while his subjects reveal both their physical and spiritual sides. In some ways, York’s art is more akin to classical, high art, but with an earthier, more naturalistic narrative. At times, he can capture what at first seems near impossible with works like Untitled (2013), where nesting birds see a young woman’s hair and clothes as nesting materials. It is only after a few moments of looking that the scene becomes believable, even normal as its naturalistic detail takes hold of your subconscious. Tondo, Tondo, Tondo opens April 1, 2017. There is an opening reception on Thursday April 6 from 6-8pm, at the Walter Wickiser Gallery located at 210 Eleventh Avenue, Suite 303, New York City. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"If you had casual plans to check out a copy of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale from your local library, we have some bad news: The waitlists are almost as daunting as the author’s dystopian vision for the future. Hundreds of Handmaid’s Tale fans in New York City are waiting to get their hands on Atwood’s novel, soon to hit Hulu as an adapted TV series starring Elizabeth Moss, Samira Wiley, Joseph Fiennes and Alexis Bledel, according to a recent report from Patch verified by The Huffington Post. In February, readers placed 183 holds on 64 copies of the book at the New York Public Library alone. By March, the NYPL added 32 more copies of the book into circulation, and the number of holds jumped to 534. “As of today, there are currently 546 holds on 96 copies of The Handmaid’s Tale,” a NYPL representative told HuffPost on Monday. “For background, according to our online catalog, there aren’t other dystopian titles with the same level of checkouts or holds.” The NYPL isn’t the only public library experiencing a surge in demand for The Handmaid’s Tale, which recently rocketed to the top of Amazon’s best-seller list. According to the Chicago Public Library’s website, there seem to be four of 160 paperback copies of the book available to check out, though there are currently 63 holds on six other copies and 318 holds on 81 available ebooks. The San Francisco Public Library presents a similar backlog; there are 101 holds on 54 physical copies and 283 holds on 65 ebooks. The Houston Public Library boasts zero available physical copies. Demand for the book shouldn’t take anyone by surprise. Atwood’s 1985 novel is set in a near-future, totalitarian U.S. civilization called the Republic of Gilead, which is built on Christian fundamentalist values and fixated on the declining birthrate of its population. The story is told from the perspective of Offred, a “Handmaid” suddenly forced to abandon her relatively free life in order to have sex with, and produce children for, a high-ranking man whose wife is infertile. Offred is one of a number of Handmaids subjected to the reproductive rights nightmare that unfurls. A description of The Handmaid’s Tale on the Houston Public Library’s website characterizes it as “a novel of such power that the reader will be unable to forget its images and its forecast.” It continues: In condensed but eloquent prose, by turns cool-eyed, tender, despairing, passionate, and wry, she reveals to us the dark corners behind the establishment’s calm facade, as certain tendencies now in existence are carried to their logical conclusions. As many critics and fans ― and even Atwood herself ― have remarked, this story feels more relevant to American politics than ever. Just last month, a group of women activists made sure the parallel was clear by wearing Handmaid’s Tale–style red robes to the Texas Senate in protest of the anti-abortion bills being considered. (Ed. note: HuffPost reporter Catherine Pearson is attempting to keep up with the dizzying array of abortion-related bills in the U.S.) The NYPL did not speculate as to which factors have contributed to the book’s increase in popularity. Earlier in 2017, the waitlist for George Orwell’s 1984 surged, prompting the library to recommend a slew of other dystopian books, including the Atwood classic now sprinting off shelves. New York Times writer Alexandra Alter surmises that Americans turning to dystopia may be doing so as a response to the uneasy feelings some have felt after the election of President Donald Trump."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Head over to the website for Los Angeles-based artist Kate Durbin's newest project, ""Cloud Nine,"" and you'll be greeted by a few lustful mouths lined with dollar bills, flirtatiously positioned above a rather intrusive question: ""What have you done for money?"" The question is aimed at female-identifying artists, all of whom are encouraged to submit their ""confessions"" anonymously to a designated email address. There, Durbin gives no hints as to what she'll do with said confessions, so The Huffington Post reached out to the artist to figure out exactly why she's soliciting women online, under the guise of a common cam girl name -- cloud9.    ""The connection with the cam girl has to do with the fact that many artists I know do sex work in order to have enough time and money to be artists,"" Durbin explained. In an earlier interview with the pop culture blog Konbini, Durbin said that the responses she's received already have indeed ranged from sex work and sugar daddies to babysitting, PR jobs and parental and governmental assistance. She's heard about jobs from stints as assistants to pizza delivery, even reality television. By prying into the lives of female artists, Durbin wants to highlight the difficulties creatives face -- particularly women -- in securing funds for their work, whether it's compensation for pieces made or financial support to travel and show their work. The fact that women artists earn less money than men is hardly a secret; for example, in 2012 alone, every artist in the top 100 auction sales was a man. Durbin digs deeper than that, though, confronting the fact that women outnumber men in art school (according to Gallery Tally expert Micol Hebron, women constitute between 65 and 75 percent of students in MFA programs), only to enter a world in which men make up 70 percent of gallery-represented artists. Below, find out what Durbin had to say about art-school debt, her own financial history and exactly what she's doing with her collection of anonymous stories.  What was the inspiration for Cloud Nine? I started noticing how often my artist girlfriends’ conversations revolved around money and not what was inspiring us to make art.  I noticed how often they Skyped into conferences, because they had no institution or funding source to support their attendance. I noticed how often they didn’t write because they had to work an 8-4 job just to pay rent and then work some more to pay off their student-loan debts. I noticed how often they defaulted on their loans because they didn’t have money to pay them. I noticed how many of them had sugar daddies and felt like they had to hide it. I noticed how many of them had trust funds and felt like they had to hide it. I noticed all the adjuncts who were teaching six classes at three different schools and not making enough to live, and also not making art. I noticed all the paintings being flipped and selling for bank, and then I noticed my friends who were on food stamps and who couldn’t afford dental work.  I started to notice everything in the world around me that had to do with art and money, and I paid attention to it, instead of ignoring it -- instead of believing in the fantasy that these were all “individual failings,” that none of these people were “good enough” artists to make it. This is how “Cloud Nine” came to be.

How many stories have you gathered so far, and how did you go about reaching out to women?

I have 50-plus stories so far, and hope to gather more. The call is viral on Facebook, and Konbini’s article helped. I’ve reached out to female-identifying artists who I know personally, and have asked them to share their stories and to spread the call. I’m specifically reaching into as many communities as I can, of varying socio-economic backgrounds. The project is DIY. I don’t have a team reaching out for me. I’m doing this while simultaneously working other jobs.

What form will ""Cloud Nine"" take once you've compiled the stories? I will be performing the piece live online via video stream on New Hive and also on one of the world’s biggest sex camming sites simultaneously. I don’t want to give the performance away, but I will be playing with the idea of “confession,” performing as a cam girl/artist. The stories will be woven into the performance.

You mentioned to Konbini that talk of how artists make money was never discussed in school. Ideally, what would these discussions look like to you? Would you have benefited from a class geared toward the economics of being an artist?   The short answer is yes, but I think we have larger systemic problems that won’t be alleviated by a class on the economics of being an artist (although that should just be mandatory within our current system). It should also be noted that not all artists create the type of work that can be bought and sold for money (take poets, for example), or want to work within the gallery system.

MFA programs themselves perpetuate debt, as well as credentialism: two economic disadvantages to artists. Yes, some programs pay full tuition, and those are the ones people should be attending. The fact that it’s sort of a given for artists to get MFAs -- and, increasingly, PhDs -- is a sign of the bureaucratization of our era. And of course, many people get MFAs in order to go on to teach, yet most teaching work is now adjunct labor. Adjuncts are not paid a living wage and not given any job security. The majority of adjuncts are women. Can you see how the odds are stacking higher and higher against female-identifying artists (and, let’s not forget, artists of color, queer artists, trans artists)? Can you see how increasingly it is only artists who had money to begin with who can succeed in such a system?

People have long said that artists should “know what they are getting into” when they become artists and suffer. Now people are starting to say that to college teachers. It’s a way to shame people from speaking out against systemic abuse -- and neglect is a form of abuse. We exist currently in a system that does not support human beings with basic resources to use their gifts in this world. We exist within a system where art is not valued, which makes sense, because human beings are not valued in this system either. But is this the world we want? If not, we need to overcome our shame and fear and speak out about the realities of our lives as artists.  That is the first step. Then, to dream of something better. Yoko Ono says, “A dream you dream alone is just a dream, but a dream we dream together is reality.” I personally would love to see something like universal basic income put into place as a step toward alleviating this problem. It also serves to alleviate the increasing income equality and unemployment that is resulting as technology and robots take over human jobs over the next few decades. So this is not just about artists -- artists here are the canaries in a coal mine, in a sense. Yet of course it would be beautiful to live in a world filled with art, instead of people producing things or doing jobs they don’t care about just to eat and die.

Obvious question: what have you done for money? What haven’t I done?

I plan to share my full job history during the performance, but I will give you a partial rundown now of some of the jobs I’ve had. I started working when I was 12, running my own babysitting business in two neighborhoods. I worked almost every day -- my parents homeschooled me, and as a result I could work all the time. Through high school I worked in fast food, at Krispy Kreme, and in college at a Jamba Juice knock-off shop and then at a mom-and-pop health food store. After college I worked a series of miserable administrative jobs, from data entry to [being an] administrative assistant to writing the intros for religious radio shows.

For the past seven years, since I got out of grad school, I have worked as an adjunct professor both in person and online. I often worked more than full time but did not have health insurance or a living wage. Next year will be the first year I have a full-time teaching job. I love teaching, but it is very hard to make a living teaching college.

There is more to my economic history that is difficult for me to talk about, all of which I will confess during the performance.

Do you have anything else you want to add to people who either want to take part in the project or see it when it's completed?

I would love to hear your stories if you want to share them with me. All of your identifying information will be removed, so it’s totally anonymous. Please send your story to cloudnineconfess@gmail.com.  Tune in to the ""Cloud Nine"" performance on May 28 on New Hive at 7 p.m. PST/10 p.m. EST. Images by Tien Tienngern."
ARTS & CULTURE,"
Photo by Rachel Neville Panel after panel convenes to ask why there are not more dancers of color in ballet. My heart sinks every time. Where is Dance Theatre of Harlem in this conversation? It is so odd to feel like an outsider on an issue that touched my life so profoundly and was at least a part of what Arthur Mitchell set out to address 46 years ago when he and Karel Shook cofounded DTH in the basement of a church in Harlem.   Perhaps it's because, while DTH has always been a celebration of the richness of African American culture as well as the grand tradition of classical ballet, as a racially, ethnically, culturally diverse ballet company, we are not now -- and never have been -- about being an all-black ballet company. Arthur Mitchell created DTH to enable people to see this art form of ballet in a different way. He succeeded magnificently. The company he created caught the world's imagination.   Now, five years after Arthur Mitchell passed the artistic reins on to me, the many preconceptions that get in the way of understanding why Dance Theatre of Harlem exists are all too clear to me. DTH is here to build an alternate future for this powerful and exquisite art form. The goal is to dispel the notion that ballet is exclusive to one culture or one group of people and to show that the intrinsic power of ballet as a dance form of expression is more than skin deep.  The early years of DTH felt like an awakening. In 1969, I, with a handful of others, seized the opportunity Arthur Mitchell's vision offered and actually had the career in ballet that everyone had told us was not possible. Because of that, by 1979, young ballet dancers of color started walking into the studio knowing they belonged there. For the dancers and public alike, ballet was revealed in a new light.  I don't think any of us actually realized what a grim day it was back in 2004 when DTH was forced to close down its touring company.  For many of those company members, it was the end of their careers. Scant few found jobs in ballet and the pattern of exclusion resumed. Without examples to emulate, the stream of confident, accomplished dancers of color dried to a trickle. Forty years after Arthur Mitchell made a difference, dancers of color are again supplicants at the gate, begging to be accepted in an art form that literally can't see us and so will not let us in. It's a tough problem. American racial attitudes aside, nothing will change until those of us whose work is to keep this art form alive choose to define a new aesthetic for ballet in the 21st century. Only then will we begin to make this art form vital and relevant. We all know the story that when George Balanchine came to America to start a ballet company, he imagined it would be made up of six black dancers and six white. That never happened, but Balanchine did redefine the ballet aesthetic to create a company that was uniquely American. It was a brilliant step forward. It is time for the next step. Balanchine taught us to look at the human body in motion in a new way and, in the long relay race that is art, Arthur Mitchell, took the baton and carried it forward.  The Dance Theatre of Harlem company returned to its work of bringing people together through art a little more than two years ago. And while the world has changed in many ways there is still a distance to go. Ballet is a complex and beautiful human endeavor the experience of which can change lives. Yes, ballet does have a color. It is the rich color of humanity -- in all of its shades. That's what Dance Theatre of Harlem is about -- opening minds to what is possible. See us at City Center April 8-11."
BUSINESS,"Jeff Bezos, along with his wife MacKenzie, announced on Friday that they’d be donating a $33 million dollar grant to the country’s largest scholarship program for “Dreamers,” a group of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. The Amazon CEO’s donation to TheDream.US program will give “1,000 undocumented immigrant graduates of U.S. high schools with [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] status the opportunity to go to college,” he said according a statement published on the fund’s website.  The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, also known as DACA, is an Obama-era program that protects those who were brought to the U.S. illegally as minors from deportation. The program helps roughly 700,000 Dreamers, but the Trump administration is currently phasing it out. There has been a six-month delay for recipients in 2017, and the Department of Homeland Security will allow previously issued permits to expire starting on March 5. Bezos also noted in the statement why this cause is important to him and his wife ― highlighting that his adopted father was an immigrant who fled from Cuba. “My dad came to the U.S. when he was 16 as part of Operation Pedro Pan,” Bezos said. “He landed in this country alone and unable to speak English. With a lot of grit and determination – and the help of some remarkable organizations in Delaware – my dad became an outstanding citizen, and he continues to give back to the country that he feels blessed him in so many ways. MacKenzie and I are honored to be able to help today’s Dreamers by funding these scholarships.”  Bezos’ announcement comes just a day after President Donald Trump made insulting remarks about immigrant groups, calling their respective homelands “shithole countries.” He also singled out Haitian immigrants, saying that they specifically should be left out of any deal. Candy Marshall, president of TheDream.US, said in the statement, the grant from the Bezos family “is a shot in the arm for Dreamer students at a time when some are questioning whether they should be in the United States at all. We would invite anyone who questions the value of Dreamers to please come meet some of our students.” CORRECTION: A previous version of this story mistakenly indicated a photo of Jeff Bezos with Jennifer Cast, vice president of Amazon Books, portrayed Jeff Bezos with his wife MacKenzie."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Since late January, arts organizations have been bracing for President Donald Trump’s administration to target cultural agencies, including the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, for brutal cuts ― even elimination. On Wednesday, the president’s proposed budget for federal discretionary spending in fiscal year 2018 fulfilled the darkest of these fears, requesting that all federal funding be stripped from the NEA and NEH. The shuttering of these agencies were proposed along with numerous deep cuts to branches such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department. Now, arts and humanities institutions and advocacy groups are redoubling efforts to protect federal arts funding from far-reaching, perhaps even permanent, damage. “The impact here is very severe because these institutions stand to be shuttered entirely,” pointed out PEN America executive director Suzanne Nossel in a phone conversation with The Huffington Post. “When a budget is cut, it can be restored at a later time. When an institution is abolished, it’s not going to come back.” Arlene Goldbard, chief policy wonk at the U.S Department of Arts and Culture (a non-government-affiliated nonprofit), called the cuts “at once shocking and unsurprising” in an email to HuffPost. “For reasons far more symbolic than cost-cutting, [Trump] wants to eliminate the small programs that help us know and understand each other, those that make the constitutional commitment to freedom of expression real, for what does it mean to declare a right without the means to exercise it?” The NEA and NEH being federal agencies, they cannot lobby for their own continued existence, as their respective chairpersons Jane Chu and William D. Adams both emphasized in statements on Thursday. “We must abide by this budget request as this initial stage of the federal budget process gets under way,” Adams stated. “It will be up to Congress over the next several months to determine funding levels for fiscal year 2018.” Both continued to make the case for their value, however. “We see our funding actively making a difference with individuals of all ages in thousands of communities, large, small, urban and rural, and in every Congressional District in the nation,” wrote Chu. In his statement on the NEH, Adams specified a number of projects that the institution provided with crucial support:  Residents in Whitesburg, Kentucky, are preserving the photographs and films of their local Appalachian region through Appalshop cultural center. Veterans returning from war in Iraq and Afghanistan are using their experiences to perform in the Aquila Theatre’s Warrior Chorus. Students, teachers and historians have access to the papers of Founding Father George Washington, which have been carefully preserved and catalogued. Through these projects and thousands of others, the National Endowment for the Humanities has inspired and supported what is best in America. Stephen Kidd, executive director of the National Humanities Alliance (NHA), agreed, arguing that losing funding for the NEH would have wide-ranging consequences ― particularly for underserved communities. “It would deeply affect access to and participation in the humanities programs that help to bridge differences in communities and help to ensure that the cultural heritage of both rural and urban communities around the country is preserved,” he told HuffPost in a phone conversation. “It would undermine the creation of innovative education programs that reach communities around the country, and students at all levels.” While major population centers such as New York City tend to benefit from wealthy patrons and well-established, popular museums, theaters and programs, more rural and impoverished areas may rely more heavily on federal funding to sustain artistic life. “A lot of these resources go to communities that are underprivileged and don’t have entities that can step in” to make up for lost federal arts funding, Nossel told HuffPost. The Washington Post noted on Thursday that, according to the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies (NASAA), “poor and rural communities would be hardest hit” as “[a]bout 25 percent of NEA block-grant funds go to rural communities and 54 percent to low-income areas.” Publishers, artistic institutions and even crowdfunding companies sprang to defend federal arts funding, as well: The arts are not a frill. #SavetheNEA https://t.co/Xt6MEusG6R pic.twitter.com/9AJAirGp4Q EXPAND the NEAEXPAND the NEHEXPAND PBSEXPAND NPREXPAND Planned Parenthoodwe're going the wrong waywe already weren't doing enough And now the fight to save the #NEA and #NEH begins. Let us not forget that what remains of a great society is its arts The Metropolitan Museum of Arts put out a statement on Thursday arguing that the proposal “is shortsighted and does a terrible disservice to the American people. For more than 50 years, these programs have provided, at modest cost, essential support to arts organizations throughout the country — many times sustaining the arts in areas where people do not have access to major institutions like the Metropolitan Museum.” The 11 arts groups that make up New York’s Lincoln Center (including the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic) overcame a history of internecine squabbles to sign a joint statement condemning the cuts, according to the New York Times, which notes that the groups only rely on federal funding for a small fraction of their budgets. “The total cost of the NEA is less than one dollar a year for every American,” the statement says. “But because it is so successful and its imprimatur so prestigious, every dollar the NEA contributes leads to nine additional dollars being donated from other sources.”  The Sundance Institute, which was created with the aid of NEA funding in 1981, also released a comment, stating, “Defunding the Endowment undermines our national artistic heritage, and handicaps our future potential.”   On Twitter, other arts professionals and organizations had more colorful words of objection:  The state of the world calls out for poetry to save it.—Lawrence Ferlinghetti#SaveTheNEA @NEAarts @NEHgov https://t.co/UlSIpfePUr pic.twitter.com/pwq2bQzqhO The NEA and NEH (combined) cost less than this fella's federally funded golf weekends in Florida. pic.twitter.com/ZqyDIlcQFV This man out here coming after POC, women, and now art? AM I ALLOWED TO EXIST EVEN? The institutions have been attacked by Republicans before, notably in the mid-90s, when a GOP Congressional majority, led by Newt Gingrich, passed a bill in the House of Representatives to defund the NEA. The bill did not pass the Senate. Past fights, however, typically relied on displays of moral outrage against specific projects funded by the NEA. “Those battles were highly politicized, and there was a lot of focus on the nature of the funding and what kind of projects were being underwritten and if they were worthy,” recalled PEN America’s Nossel. “This much more slash and burn, and no one seems to be concerned with what exactly is being funded … and the worrying thing is that it comes in the context of these Draconian budget proposals.” As Congress will approve the final budget, advocates remain hopeful that widespread support, both within the legislature and within the citizenry at large, will save the NEA and NEH. “We are heartened by the level of bipartisan support that members of Congress have shown for the NEH in recent years and in recent weeks, as well,” Kidd told HuffPost. He and Nossel each cited a February letter sent by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) urging President Trump to continue support for the NEH and NEA. The letter, which was signed by 23 other senators, including Republicans Susan Collins and Shelly Moore Capito, argued that “[f]ederal support for the arts and humanities is essential to our education system, economy, and who we are as a nation.” The battle for the NEA and NEH continues ― and Nossel warned that, with such severe cuts proposed in so many areas of the Trump budget, advocates need to keep their eye on the ball and continue calling their representatives to make the case for arts funding. “The challenge is going to be … ensuring that with all the priorities and areas of funding that have to be saved, that these institutions aren’t lost in the shuffle,” she told HuffPost. “There will probably be some compromises made, and we need to make sure this isn’t one of them.”"
BUSINESS,"BALTIMORE, Md. ― Joshua Geathers spent two exhausting years inside an Amazon warehouse complex in Southeast Baltimore. He worked first as a packer, bundling shipments to go out for delivery, and later supervised for quality control, eventually earning $14.70 an hour. The position paid better than his previous job at Staples, but he was often so drained after working that he used his paid time off just to sleep and recover. “I felt tired all the time,” said the 24-year-old Geathers, who lives within walking distance of two adjacent Amazon facilities. He found he sometimes had to run to complete his tasks on time, even though the warehouse had a strict policy against running for safety reasons.  “I’m a hardworking person, and I don’t complain about hard work,” Geathers said. “But it’s a very strenuous job.” Cities and states around the country, including Baltimore and Maryland, are now jockeying to become home to Amazon’s next headquarters, branded HQ2. Local government officials have proposed massive tax breaks for the online retailer. And the desperate bids to attract tens of thousands of tech jobs through the subsidies is giving corporate watchdogs heartburn. But Amazon has already been benefiting from public subsidies for years, in exchange for warehouse jobs like Geathers’ that pay far less than headquarter jobs. Geathers’ experience may not be what Baltimore officials had in mind when they put together a juicy package of financial incentives to lure Amazon to the area in 2013. They offered the world’s largest online retailer $43 million in tax credits, a generous public subsidy even by Amazon standards. Then-Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake boasted at the time that “one thousand jobs is nothing to sneeze at.”  Tax incentives like those in Maryland have helped fuel Amazon’s rapid growth of its distribution network. In 2015 and 2016 alone, local governments committed roughly a quarter of a billion dollars in subsidies to Amazon facilities, according to Good Jobs First, a progressive nonprofit that tracks subsidy awards. Amazon raked in another $600 million in the decade leading up to 2015, the group found. In many cases, government officials offered the tax breaks with little or no public discussion about wages or working conditions.   As the retailer expands to new areas in its effort to dominate same-day delivery, more cities and counties will have to ask themselves: How much public money is an Amazon warehouse job really worth? “The jobs Amazon creates in these warehouses are not good jobs. Even the direct hires are relatively low paid, and the work is grueling,” said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit that’s been critical of tax subsidies for large national retailers. “The notion that investing this kind of money in an Amazon warehouse is a long-term economic development strategy is really incorrect.” Amazon says its contributions to the Maryland economy are well worth the taxpayer investments. The company has put a billion dollars in its operations and now has 5,000 full-time employees in the state, according to data provided by Amazon. It recently inked a deal to open an additional Baltimore area fulfillment center, where it expects to employ another 1,500 people. The first Baltimore facility is emblematic of major shifts in the U.S. economy, as manufacturing jobs have given way to retail and service work. For seven decades the site was home to a General Motors plant, providing good-paying union jobs for the city’s working class. The last van rolled off the assembly line in 2005, when the plant closed and laid off 1,100 workers. City and state officials spent years looking for a company to breathe life into the 2.8-million square-foot site. With the rise of online retail, fulfillment centers have become a natural fit for post-industrial plants now sitting idle. The typical warehouse occupies a million square feet and employs between 1,000 and 3,000 workers. But the positions don’t necessarily have the same middle-class trappings as a GM manufacturing job. An Amazon spokesman said its fulfillment center workers receive “highly competitive wages” that pay “on average 30 percent more than traditional retail jobs,” a figure consistent with worker interviews. The average retail salesperson in the U.S. earns $10.90 per hour, according to the Labor Department, while low-level Amazon warehouse workers said they earn between $13 and $15 per hour in Maryland, where the minimum wage is $8.75.    But the work is far more physically demanding ― after all, these are warehouse jobs, not retail jobs. And in many cases, the positions still don’t pay enough to sustain a family. Of the half-dozen workers HuffPost interviewed who’d cycled through the Baltimore location, all earned wages that equated to annual salaries in the mid- to high-$20,000s. “It’s not a lot of money, but it beats McDonald’s or Wendy’s,” explained Nigel Hammett, who worked in the Baltimore facility last holiday season.  Many workers end up at Amazon fulfillment centers as temps whose jobs may end at any moment, employed by outside firms that offer lesser benefits than direct hires receive. Still, local governments find the prospect of Amazon warehouse jobs hard to resist, particularly in down-and-out neighborhoods. In the case of Baltimore, many of the city’s longtime residents have been left behind in the now-booming regional economy. The unemployment rate for African-Americans in the city is three times that of whites, and the median household income for an African-American family is around $34,000, according to one analysis. Only 13 percent of African-American adults in the city have a Bachelor’s degree or higher. Sierra Singleton wound up at the Baltimore Amazon facility in 2015 for the same reason many others do: It was the best job she could find. She was 22 at the time and had no fixed address. She was poor enough to be grateful for the free T-shirt that came with the job. She started out at $13.00 per hour, as opposed to the $8.50 of her previous job, and got 50 cents more per hour for working overnight shifts. She eventually got her own one-bedroom apartment near the fulfillment center. There were some things Singleton didn’t like about the facility. Many of the best supervisory positions seemed to go to people who weren’t from Baltimore, and the job was so taxing that she eventually had to move on after two years. “I was pushing my body past its limits,” she said. Still, she credits the company with keeping a roof over her head, and she left on good terms in November, in case she ever wants to return. Amazon’s arrival, in her estimation, has been a good thing for Southeast Baltimore. “I got a place because of this job. I could afford living somewhere outside of Section 8,” Singleton said, referring to federally subsidized housing. “Being able to pay my bills and stay above water, it was definitely because of Amazon.”  Singleton’s experience helps explain why so many cities and counties offer subsidies for Amazon warehouses: They fear much-needed jobs will go somewhere else. But critics of the tax breaks say governments are funding the demise of their own local retailers by subsidizing Amazon’s growth. They also argue that officials are giving away money in exchange for fulfillment centers that would be built in the same regions anyway, regardless of subsidies, given Amazon’s same-day delivery aspirations.  Amazon’s goal of delivering to its customers within mere hours requires more and more warehouses, and not just in the more rural, low-cost areas where it built many of its earliest. The company is bringing fulfillment jobs to dense coastal areas like Baltimore because its business plan compels it to. Greg LeRoy, the director of Good Jobs First, the nonprofit that tracks public subsidies, said local and state governments have their strategy backwards. “Amazon should be paying to arrive, not getting paid to arrive,” said LeRoy. “We’re just maddened by it.” Some of the subsidies for Amazon warehouses are less than a million dollars a piece. But in Ohio, the company netted $17 million for two facilities; in Wisconsin, $32 million for one, according to Good Jobs First. A Jacksonville, Fla., warehouse came with a total of $27 million in subsidies. The largest so far was Baltimore. Most of these subsidies come in the form of corporate income tax credits, property tax abatements, infrastructure improvements and tax increment financing.  The bulk of Amazon’s subsidies in Baltimore came as state “enterprise zone” credits reserved for investments in struggling areas. The retailer qualified for those funds by using the old GM site. Officials also provided the company with more than $1 million in loans that would be forgiven in 10 years so long as the company maintained certain staffing levels and had at least $175 million invested in the facility. There were no requirements related to wages, and officials said they weren’t especially concerned about reports out of Pennsylvania that Amazon warehouse workers were being hospitalized for heat exhaustion. A spokeswoman for Maryland’s commerce department said Amazon must provide the state with documentation on its job count at the end of each year. So far, the retailer has exceeded its obligations on the employment front, creating more jobs than required. Enrico Moretti, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said communities are playing a “zero sum game” when they compete to lure a fulfillment center to the area, since the facility is going to end up somewhere. “With the subsidies, they are essentially giving away some of the benefits that the fulfillment center would generate for the community,” he said. Still, he noted, tax breaks like the ones for Amazon in Baltimore can seem small when compared to deals for manufacturing plants, for which governments often shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars per job. That’s because the ancillary benefits of a fulfillment center can seem small, Moretti said. A major manufacturing plant could attract additional suppliers, and Amazon’s next headquarters could attract more tech companies and high-paying jobs. But “there’s not going to be a wave of tech startups because there’s an Amazon fulfillment center,” he added. Many areas have been reluctant to attach strings to their Amazon arrangements related to working conditions. An analysis done of fulfillment center deals by the Business Journals network turned up instances where officials actually waived wage requirements for Amazon that would normally apply to other corporations, just so Amazon could secure the subsidies at stake. “Their rationale, repeated by local officials interviewed by The Business Journals: Any job is better than no job,” the site reported.   Even though the subsidies are predicated on jobs, Amazon won’t always need the workers that it does now. Warehouses are becoming increasingly automated, with robots performing tasks that humans were responsible for just months ago. These advancements make warehouse work less tedious and stressful, freeing up workers to supervise machines that do the heavy lifting. But the new efficiencies also translate into fewer jobs, particularly less skilled ones.  Joshua Geathers didn’t stick around the Baltimore warehouse long enough to see robots take anybody’s job. He left Amazon last year and now works as a field technician for a data services firm, making around $9 more per hour than he did at the warehouse. He’s grateful not to be in the fulfillment center in the runup to the holidays. He found that trying to build a career there required a certain degree of desperation.  “It’s a place where one would work if they were in dire need of money,” he said. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly reported the number of full-time Amazon workers in Maryland. It is 5,000."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Off and on for the past year I have been working with Ethelyn Friend and a company of artists on an inimitable piece of art called ""_____"", An Opera.  It is an Opera that is improvised, meaning that the music is created on the spot by pianist Gary Grundei and the ensemble of performers every night. To see the performance is to witness the creative process first hand.  In addition to the improvised musical score there are sections of the show called ""Windows"", during which the protagonist, the Writer, literally roles a dice deciding by chance the character, the song and the quality with which it will be sung. The Opera takes place in a small Victorian House, which allows no more than 16 viewers a night. It feels like your very own personal performance. Each audience member is given a small origami box with tiny gifts inside including a bell, a flashlight, ear plugs and a candle along with a special program. Audience members are encouraged to interact and contribute to the performance through the use of their bell and flashlight. They can ring for a moment of stillness, of mindfulness or they can shine a light on whatever they choose. Yet, the truly breathtaking aspect of this show goes beyond its experimentation. The works greatest gift lies in the story itself, based on real events, which reveals the creative process as a healing one. The story is about an artist, a woman, the Writer, who is in the midst of writing an Opera. The audience watches while the Writer discovers her creation as it unfolds. In the vein of Jungian archetypes, the characters she imagines into being are the various aspects of herself. Theres her innocent child-self, her highest self/the all loving and all accepting divinity within, the part that is broken/ostracized/unloved/forced into shadow, the ego maniac, the often blinded and silenced consciousness who bears witness to it all. As the story unfolds The Writer is confronted with the traumatic memory of childhood incest. The story she is writing begins to unearth what has long been buried. At first she is in denial. She tries to ""delete"" this part of her story. When the characters begin to reveal the truth she tells them ""not yet"", in an attempt to prolong the inevitable. For a time the Writer's tactics of interruption, procrastination, and distraction are successful. However, eventually the truth can no longer be avoided. All her parts begin to coalesce, joining forces and each raising their voices in an attempt to shine light on this shadow. Through her own divine wisdom and fearlessness she opens herself to her full, unedited, unsuppressed story. She finds herself face to face with her buried suffering, looking directly into the  darkest part of herself. She sees for the first time how she has become frozen and stuck, unable to move forward by the unprocessed trauma of her past. She allows the shadow to step into the light and places it in the warm and clear seeing embrace of loving-kindess. She creates space in which her shadowed trauma can be expressed and reborn. So much of the healing process within the performance is expressed through the voice. With an ensemble or performers steeped in Roy Hart vocal training, the piece expresses the voice as the muscle of the soul and does not shy away from its darkest parts. As the shadow is revealed, the voices of the ensemble sonically convey the messy heights and depths, the lightness and darkness of what it is to be human. An ""Aria of Broken Sounds"" follows a song exclaiming the intensity and richness of human suffering, ""Soul at the White Heat"". The piece travels from gorgeous operatic and sing song tones to the shredded, powerfully raw voices that culturally we are taught to suppress and silence just like our beautiful shadows. To say that working on this piece has changed my life is not an overstatement. Living inside of this story for over a year and performing it night after night undoubtedly has had an effect on me personally. I imagine the same can be said of my incredible collaborators, although I will not speak for them. Unknowingly at first, and then very clearly, I found myself working with my own shadow, my broken bits that I shove to the side wishing they would go away. Through this process I have begun to viscerally perceive how all my parts, the divine and the painfully ugly have a place within me. Before each rehearsal and every show we had a routine of reading random excerpts from the works of Pema Chödrön. She reminded us nearly every day that our main challenge in being human is to come to know and befriend ourselves, all parts of ourselves without discrimination. The Roy Hart practice too, teaches of the equanimity of all sounds, the high, the low, the beautiful and the ugly. If all sounds arise from the soul then all sounds must be treated equally. Healing and personal transformation begin with awareness and integration. This is what this piece has been teaching me. And from what our audiences have shared, the piece has offered more than any of us could have ever imagined. I am forever grateful to this creative process and those who bravely led the way on this incredible journey. While ""________"", An Opera is up and running and has had an entirely sold out run, we are still trying to raise funds. Our intention is to continue sharing this deeply moving work with many more audiences beyond this 3 week run. Please consider donating to the Indiegogo campaign. We only have till midnight tonight to reach our goal and we are currently only at 66%.  Thank you and many blessings.

ENTERTAINMENT,"When we first see Marlo (Charlize Theron) in “Tully,” she is trudging down the stairs of her compact suburban home. Slippers enter the frame. Then come pink pajama pants, a pregnant belly and, finally, a labored expression. Is it exhaustion? Stress? Despondency? All of that and more: Marlo has two grade-school kids, a newborn on the way and a husband (Ron Livingston) who escapes to their bedroom at night to play video games. “My body looks like a relief map for a war-torn country,” she later says when asked about her dormant sex life. Marlo keeps trudging, and “Tully” hovers around her quest for inactivity ― a moment’s quiet, a dollop of extra-motherly fulfillment. Theron’s previous collaboration with writer Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman, 2011′s “Young Adult,” posited the reverse concept. When we first meet Mavis, Theron’s boozy cherry bomb, she is passed out in bed, facedown, still wearing the cups she’d stuffed inside her bra the night before. Mavis drinks because there is too much inactivity in her life: not enough progress on the YA series she ghostwrites, few meaningful relationships, no self-control.  “Tully,” opening in theaters this weekend, and “Young Adult” share a common thread beyond their creative architects. Both are dramedies about depression. Mavis and Marlo struggle in different ways to compartmentalize the loneliness they suffer and the exasperation brought on by the circumstances of their grownup lives, which snuck up like bandits in the night, pilfering their girlish insouciance. In high school, Mavis was the queen bee ― but what happens to the person who peaked at 17? As a 20-something living in Brooklyn, Marlo was a free spirit unburdened by so-called responsibilities ― but what happens to the person who, at 40, realizes she traded fleeting childlike liberation for the permanence of a nuclear family? (Her disappointment would be justified if she’d ever had any real aspirations, Marlo laments.) Lost youth is one of Hollywood’s favorite themes. How many times have we seen characters return home, like Mavis and Marlo do, to retrace the nostalgic steps of their former selves? The throughline from “The Graduate” to “Garden State” persists in countless movies ― so much so that, in “Young Adult,” Mavis tells an old classmate of inferior social stature (Patton Oswalt), “But love conquers all. Haven’t you seen ‘The Graduate’?” Therein lies the rub, and the nuance. Mavis misinterprets the point of “The Graduate,” hence why her attempt to woo a now-married-with-a-tyke high school flame (Patrick Wilson) is as punch-drunk and misguided as Benjamin Braddock interrupting Elaine Robinson’s wedding and sailing off with her into the unpaved future.  But where Mavis was often blind to the realities of her depression, Marlo is reminded of hers at every turn. She has to call her kids a “blessing” because that’s what loving moms do. She has to reduce feelings about her body to punchlines because women aren’t supposed to express earnest resentment about the defects of having children. When Marlo’s husband drives her to the hospital to give birth, Reitman places the camera in the backseat; we mostly see the rain sloshing across the windshield on what is meant to be a joyful occasion.  Hoping to avoid a “repeat” of “last time” ― a nod to the postpartum blues that hit Marlo in the past ― her brother (Mark Duplass) recommends she hire a “night nanny.” (“Everybody does it,” he insists.) In comes Tully (Mackenzie Davis), a 26-year-old manic pixie dream babysitter who relives Marlo of her p.m. infant duties, bakes the older kids cupcakes and tidies Marlo’s cluttered home so it looks spotless come daylight. (“I’m like Saudi Arabia! I have an energy surplus,” she insists.) Ah, the power of sleep. As if struck by a dose of magical realism, Marlo suddenly has energy, verve, a sex drive. But something else occurs, gradually: She realizes that Tully epitomizes the 20-something zest she still yearns for ― the halcyon days when she ambled through Bed-Stuy, socialized at all hours, flitted from one half-commitment to the next, embraced the potential toxicity of over-invested friendships.  In “Young Adult,” Mavis’ efforts to flaunt her good side ― to conceal the acerbic word vomit ― in hopes of reigniting a lost love make her more and more bitter, to the point where she eventually explodes, yelling invective in the middle of her crush’s baby-naming ceremony, to which she barely received an invitation in the first place. It’s that explosion, and the awareness that she blew the one desire she really had, that finally prompts her to question her condition, even if only briefly. “Young Adult” ends with a juxtaposition: Mavis gives the narrator of her novel the sunny closing line “Life, here I come,” words she recites while peering at her car’s smashed fender. She’s gained a little hope, but reality is still crushing. Will anything change? You decide.  But “Tully,” the more sophisticated of the two, builds toward a more definitive upbeat. It turns out Tully’s life isn’t as enviable as Marlo imagined, and after the pair galavant through Brooklyn so the latter can reclaim her youth, she awakens with a broader lease on life. “Young Adult” pulls no punches about Mavis’ inability to reconcile her depression, but Marlo, a mother and wife and employed human resources professional, is haunted by the idea that she’s supposed to be satisfied. The realization that maybe she’s better off in this phase of her existence, and that maybe it’s OK to be resentful about her kids sometimes ― notions born of a third-act twist that surpasses the movie’s manic-pixie trappings ― lends “Tully” its optimistic aura. “Tully” also marks Cody and Reitman's creative evolution. (They’ve both seen highs and lows in recent years; this the best thing either has done in a while.) Their partnership began with 2007′s “Juno,” a tender but overwritten confection whose twee appeal requires it to end hopefully. To see this transition, from the biting melodrama of “Young Adult” to the gauzy existentialism of “Tully,” is to witness Cody and Reitman's storytelling mature, even as it’s still anchored by Theron’s marvelous subtleties. Like Marlo, they’re grownups now. The relics of their younger days are worth revisiting, but this is the sweet spot. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"UPDATE (March 30): The Guardian reported Thursday that a listing for Timothy Snyder’s On Tyranny was a separate entry for a fake book of the same name. As noted below, the outlet previously stated that the entry for On Tyranny had been changed. The publisher attributed the second, false entry — for a coloring book authored ostensibly by a “Timothy Strauss” — to Russians who wanted to undermine Snyder’s work. Amazon removed the listing for the false coloring book on Wednesday, citing deviation from its guidelines for the fake. PREVIOUSLY: Not long after Donald Trump’s inauguration as president, publishers rushed an anti-totalitarian handbook by Yale historian Timothy Snyder to print. On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons From The Twentieth Century was published by Vintage this month in the U.K., its arrival heralded by an eye-grabbing poster campaign. This week, the book’s Amazon U.K. page was hacked, probably by Russian hackers, according to The Guardian. The miscreants replaced On Tyranny’s cover image and description text with that of... an adult coloring book? That’s right, drink ‘n’ draw lovers: It seems like even hackers have hopped on the coloring trend. The fake description of a fictional coloring book by “Timothy Strauss” urges customers to “color these images and read these lessons to Make World Great Again.” The fake coloring book that took over the page appears to marry Snyder’s name with that of Leo Strauss, a political philosopher whose 1963 discourse On Tyranny explored the possible paths to tyranny and philosophy’s role under such a regime. The cover art of the adult coloring book, appropriately, was taken from an American World War II poster advertising the sale of government bonds to fund the war. “Triumph Over Tyranny!” urges the original poster. According to The Guardian, Snyder is convinced that Russian hackers were behind the tweaks to his book’s Amazon listing. “The idea of making the world great again, the slogan left by the hacker, appears, to my knowledge, only in Russian on pro-Trump posters in the Russian Federation,” he said. A preeminent historian of Central and Eastern Europe, Snyder has previously found himself in conflict with the Russian government. His previous books Bloodlands and Black Earth drew rancor from Russian partisans thanks to his critical analysis of Josef Stalin, and On Tyranny not only critiques Russia’s past and present government, but also its alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election in aid of Trump. Now, he believes, Russian hackers are interfering with his book in order to protect Trump, who has enjoyed a particularly bad couple of weeks thanks to the embarrassing implosion of his health care bill and the ongoing fiasco of the Congressional hearings on Russian election interference. “Russia has shown a tendency to jump in to help him at such times,” Snyder told The Guardian. Vintage apprised Amazon of the breach by Wednesday morning; after remaining up long enough to utterly ruin our desire to relax through the art of adult coloring, the listing for the instant bestseller has been reverted to the correct image and text.   “All authors must follow our guidelines and those who don’t will be subject to action including potential removal of their account,” an Amazon spokesman told The Huffington Post. “The book in question is no longer available.”  As of Thursday morning, Snyder’s publisher had not responded to a request for comment.

ARTS & CULTURE,"These are the notes which accompany the article found here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-maidman/dawn-of-the-post-contempo_b_8847168.html The article text was too long for the Huffington Post blogging platform to accommodate the notes as well, so I have posted them here. 1 http://www.391.org/manifestos/1918-dada-manifesto-tristan-tzara.html 2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlheinz_Stockhausen#September_11_attacks 3 https://books.google.com/books?id=C4Ht6xnsLJUC&pg=PA16&dq=walter%20gropius%20destroyed%20plaster%20casts%20harvard&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMI_bf1pNPEyAIVydGACh1odQi1#v=onepage&q=walter%20gropius%20destroyed%20plaster%20casts%20harvard&f=false 4 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Scott_Hess 5 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-maidman/dear-jerry-notes-on-life-_b_5453722.html 6 http://danielmaidman.blogspot.com/2014/06/jerry-replies.html As long as I am laying all my cards on the table, let me clarify my feelings about Jerry Saltz. I understand these have been the subject of a certain amount of curiosity, especially given the almost inhumanly friendly tone of my response to his very rude comment about my drawing. To set the record straight, of course the comment hurt my feelings and made me angry. And of course the article was calibrated to be so friendly as to be a bit of a needling. I did, however, sincerely hope that he would take me up on my offer of life drawing together. Where there is room to persuade, I will always seek to persuade. Like those of you who read it, I thought his reply to the article was exactly what it appeared to be: sloppy, mean-spirited and intellectually dishonest.  On the other hand, whatever any of us on the Post-Contemporary side object to about how he thinks or writes, it's worth remembering that he, fairly uniquely, makes himself available to consider and respond. That's not true of a lot of people broadly aligned with his perspective in the critical establishment, whom we do not rail against, because they do not look at us, and we do not read them - but their opinions hold as much weight as his, or more, and they meet us with silence. How many critics at Artforum can you name, and describe the outlook of? I will repeat something I have often said before: I learn from reading Jerry, and I believe that he has a strong eye, especially for work within his critical bailiwick.  However, there are things I have always wanted as an artist from him as a critic, and which I have gotten in person, but which I will never get in public. I have been on the critic end of such relationships, and it is extraordinarily irritating. So it is not only for my own moral and emotional health, but also for Jerry's sake, that I do my best to think very little about him and to seek nothing from him. This was my policy before his unsolicited remarks on my drawing, and it remains my policy. I have had the good fortune to get most of what I wanted from him, from other people, and though I might have liked to have received some of it from him, he does not have it to give. I play a very small part in his life, and would prefer that what part I do play not be that of the pest.  7 https://youtu.be/ZqbJHbP61PY?t=43 8 I draw inspiration here from God's superficially perplexing justification for his command to Israel in Leviticus 19:34 (and elsewhere): ""But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt."" Now the Jews were enslaved in Egypt. So what is perplexing here is surely this - we instinctively seek the Christian justification from the moral principle of reciprocity, Luke 6:31's ""Do to others as you would have them do to you.""  Failing this, we would expect some kind of symmetry, a cosmic notion of debt: ""Thou shalt treat a stranger well; for you were treated well when you were strangers in [X]."" But the God of Exodus turns to neither of these concepts. He says: ""Thou shalt treat a stranger well; because you suffered when you were strangers."" He says: ""You know what it's like."" This is an empirical formulation. It is pre-moral, invoking not the concepts of right and wrong, but the psychological mechanism of empathy. It is on this foundation that morality is built. This demonstrates several things. First, it is a good illustration of the pragmatic quality of Judaism. Judaism will usually opt for the concrete and empirical over the abstract and analytic. Judaism is rooted in the world of things, not the kingdom of ideas; it rises into the kingdom of ideas, but it starts and ends in the life of human beings in the world. Second, it is a good illustration of how religion does one of its primary jobs, which is to build human beings. Here Judaism draws the mechanism of empathy out of its founding narrative, to explain and emphasize the necessity of empathy to its followers. The human being Judaism seeks to build is an empathetic human being."
BUSINESS,"After the United States announced they are withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, many commentators expressed the hope that firms will be able to make up for the policy slack. One such firm is Amazon that touts its environmental credentials. These include hosting rooftop solar systems, supporting Clean Power Plan, and committing to 100 percent renewable energy for its web farms. But, when soliciting HQ2 proposals, it has not listed climate considerations.  Not surprisingly, city rankings produced by various analysts fail to account for climate change vulnerability — an issue that will affect the viability of any business. Including climate vulnerability data from FEMA, we identify two cities that feature in the top 10 in both rankings. We hope this piece will motivate any company scouting for a new location to look into the climate vulnerability dimensions.  What is Amazon looking for?  In September 2017, Amazon announced that it is going to create its second headquarters (HQ2) and invited cities to send their proposals. In its Request for Proposals (RFP), Amazon listed core elements of its preferred  location: “Metropolitan areas with more than one million people; a stable and business-friendly environment; urban or suburban locations with the potential to attract and retain strong technical talent; communities that think big and creatively when considering locations and real estate options.”  By the October 18 deadline, 238 proposals were in: from cities in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, as well as by counties and even states! An economic development group supporting the bid of Greater Tucson sought to send a unique gift: a 21-foot saguaro cactus. But Amazon declined to accept such gifts as part of the bidding process, although it welcomed other gifts such as tax breaks. Business Analysts Make Recommendations  Amazon will announce its decision only next year. But this has not prevented several analyst firms and media outlets to rank these proposals and make their recommendations. Moody’s Analytics led the charge and published their top 65 candidates. Their analysis examines 34 variables such as the business environment, costs, human capital, quality of life, transportation, and distance to Amazon’s core facilities, including Amazon’s owner Jeff Bezos’ home.   Others soon followed. Anderson Economic Group produced its list of 35 top candidates, examining three categories of variables such as access to labor and services, ease of transportation, and cost of doing business. CNN, without revealing its methodology, also identified eight cities that Amazon should consider. The New York Times presented its own analysis, identifying Denver as the only candidate that can offer everything Amazon needs. But where is climate change in these rankings?   It is surprising that neither Amazon nor the analysts, who have ranked various cities, thought it fit to consider how a given city might be vulnerable to climate change. After all, sea level rise, extreme temperatures, drought, and floods would probably make it difficult for the projected 50,000 Amazon workers to function effectively in HQ2. In fact, Moody’s recently told its clients it incorporates climate risk in its state and municipal bond ratings. There is substantial evidence that climate change is already impacting communities in the U.S. According to NOAA, in 2017 alone, there were 15 significant weather and climate related events, such as drought, flooding, freeze, severe storms, tropical cyclones, and wildfires, each costing over $1 billion. Many of these events occurred in relative proximity to the top ranked cities for Amazon HQ2. The map below depicts these billion-dollar extreme weather events and the proximate location of these cities. Suppose we include climate change in the rankings We have constructed a simple indicator to measure cities’ vulnerability to climate- and weather-related extreme events. Using FEMA data on declared emergencies such as severe storms, severe ice storms, flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes, snow, coastal storms, and weather-related fires, we counted days (starting 1992) during which a county had a federally declared emergency or disaster. We started the analysis for year 1992 to include Hurricane Andrew, the second most damaging storm in the U.S. after the 1926 Great Miami storm.     Table 1 presents the top 25 cities as per Moody’s ranking and according to our climate vulnerability ranking. Top ten cities for each group are highlighted. Only two cities make it to the Top 10 in both:  Pittsburgh and Portland. This suggests that economic and business criteria probably do not help us to understand a city’s vulnerability to climate change. It is not clear how much importance Amazon should attach to climate vulnerability rankings. That is, how much should it weigh climate vulnerability in relation to economic indicators? Further, because cities may already have taken some proactive measures to climate-proof by say building sea walls, should cities be ranked on their resilience to climate change, as opposed to vulnerability? These are fair questions that Amazon and other businesses looking for a new location for their offices or factories should consider. As never before, there is a compelling reason for firms to include climate change issues in their business plans.

ENTERTAINMENT,"“Not on Rex Manning Day!” That’s been a rallying cry for fans of “Empire Records” every April 8 since the ’90s alternateen classic came out. In the 1995 film, April 8 is the day Rex Manning, a smarmy, overly manicured ’80s pop star played by Maxwell Caulfield, is scheduled to appear in the titular record store staffed by people who hate him ― and everything he stands for. April 8 also happens to be the day that the body of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was discovered in his Seattle home. This Rex Manning Day, actor Ethan Embry, who played the film’s loveably spacey character Mark, made the connection explicit.  “The reason we picked April 8th as the day to have the powdered/coifed Rex Manning visit Empire is because Kurt was found on the 8th of April, the day the music of the 90s lost its mascot,” Embry tweeted. The reason we picked April 8th as the day to have the powdered/coifed Rex Manning visit Empire is because Kurt was found on the 8th of April, the day the music of the 90s lost its mascot.#RexManningDay Embry’s co-star Johnny Whitworth, who played A.J., echoed the sentiment. Cobain, a human being and not merely a mascot, killed himself on April 5, 1994. His death shook the rock world and signaled the beginning of the end of the ’90s grunge era, which was replaced later in the decade by the more polished pop sound of boy bands and Britney Spears.

POLITICS,"The whistleblower who reportedly leaked the financial records of President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer did so after discovering that two files had disappeared from a government database. Banks are required to file suspicious activity reports (SARs) whenever transactions that may violate federal law are detected, or if certain activities may be linked to money laundering. These reports are stored on a database, which is managed by the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and can be accessed by law enforcement agents and federal officials. The unnamed whistleblower, who reportedly spent a career in law enforcement, told New Yorker reporter Ronan Farrow he grew worried when he was unable to find two SARs on attorney Michael Cohen’s financial dealings in the database. “I have never seen something pulled off the system,” the official told the magazine. “That system is a safeguard for the bank. It’s a stockpile of information. When something’s not there that should be, I immediately became concerned,” the whistleblower added. Earlier this month, Michael Avenatti, attorney for porn star Stormy Daniels, publicly disclosed that Cohen’s shell company, Essential Consultants LLC, had received hundreds of thousands of dollars from companies, including AT&T, pharmaceutical conglomerate Novartis and Columbus Nova, an investment firm with ties to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg. The New York Times later reported on the payments based on interviews and an internal review of the confidential financial records. CNN also reported that special counsel Robert Mueller had questioned Vekselberg about the payments. Essential Consultants is also the same company Cohen used to pay $130,000 to Daniels as part of a non-disclosure agreement barring her from talking about an alleged 2006 affair with Trump. On Wednesday, the Office of Government Ethics determined that the payment constituted a loan that should have been reported on the president’s June 2017 financial disclosure form. The president’s failure to disclose that he repaid Cohen for the pre-election payout to Daniels has now been referred to the Department of Justice. Let this serve as formal notice - there is significantly more evidence and facts to come relating to Mr. Cohen's dealings and Mr. Trump's knowledge and involvement. You can come clean now or wait to be outed. Your choice. We have only just begun...#Basta Details about the payments to Cohen reportedly came from SARs filed by First Republic Bank, where Essential Consultants maintained an account, the New Yorker reported. By January of this year, First Republic had filed the three suspicious-activity reports about Cohen’s account. The most recent report — the only one made public so far — examined Cohen’s transactions from September of 2017 to January of 2018, and included activity totalling almost a million dollars. It alludes to the two previous reports that the official could not find in the fincendatabase. The first report that the official was unable to locate, which covered almost seven months, appears to have listed a little over a million dollars in activity. The second report that the official was unable to locate, which investigated a three-month period between June and September of 2017, found suspect transfers totalling more than two million dollars. The individuals or corporations involved in the transactions are not yet known, but the Treasury Department’s inspector general has launched an investigation ― to find the source of the leak. Daniel W. Drezner, a Washington Post contributor who previously worked at the Treasury Department, said he was shocked to learn of Farrow’s interview with the whistleblower. As someone who worked at Treasury on anti-money laundering activities, my reaction to this @RonanFarrow story is “holy s**t.” https://t.co/JnG5Aaqw5m AT&T confirmed last week that the company had indeed hired Essential Consultants to gain insight into the Trump administration in early 2017. “Essential Consultants was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,” the company said in a statement, adding that their contract ended in December 2017. Novartis also admitted it had a $1.2 million contract with Cohen’s company at the start of Trump’s presidency. In light of the controversy, Novartis general counsel Felix Ehrat resigned from the company on Wednesday. “Although the contract was legally in order, it was an error,” Ehrat said."
ARTS & CULTURE," Hailing from Hong Kong and New Zealand, Karen Ng has danced on Good Morning America, New York Live with Ben Aaron, ABC Live, and showcased her choreography at B.B. Kings, Times Square Arts Center, and the NYC Dance Parade. She has performed at The Kennedy Center, The Blue Note Jazz Club, NYC Summerstage, Shakespeare in the Park and more. She has also produced and performed her own projects with Triple8Funk Dance Company, Soul in Motion, All Aboard Burlesque, and has brought Byron Cox (House Dance Project) and Waack It Out with Jayshri Nand to Auckland.  You were born in Hong Kong, correct? Yes, but I grew up in New Zealand. My family moved when I was around four. My dad's a chef (typical Asian immigrant parents) and he ran a restaurant. I always loved to dance and sing, so they put me in ballet school because that was the only thing available in the 80's.  Where do you consider home? New Zealand is still home [because] my parents and childhood friends are still there. But, I feel so at home in New York that I always miss it when I leave. There's nowhere else where I feel I can be me. In New Zealand, I always felt like an outsider growing up in a very white town. Even within my Asian peers, I felt different. I did the study hard and be a good Asian daughter thing for a long time. I actually studied pharmacy and worked as a pharmacist. While I was studying, I ran a hip-hop dance crew in Auckland. We were one of the two earliest dance crews who ran competitions and shows.  How did you discover your love for hip-hop? In the 90's, I was exposed to artists like A Tribe Called Quest, Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul, and of course Michael Jackson.  So your taste in music influenced your taste in dance. Yes. I saw all the dancers in the music videos and thought, ""This is dope."" At that point, I was able to choreograph and do more at my dance school. Even though it was a ballet school, my teacher said, ""Choose your music and make up this part of the dance."" We were encouraged to have a say about our dancing. In high school, I got to choreograph for talent shows, dance competitions, and musicals. What made you come to New York City? I had a lot of dancing experience while juggling college. Once I graduated and became a working adult, I dropped everything and worked 40, 50 hours a week. I didn't even realize I was miserable. My mother always brought it back to food. ""This is your main meal. Dancing, music and all that is the salt and pepper."" Suddenly, I was faced with the decision to buy my pharmacy. I didn't want to but felt this massive obligation. I enrolled in the Broadway Dance Center, where they offer this amazing International Student Visa Program. I turned down the pharmacy for this three-month program. I felt alive again and realized my soul was missing all this time. You no longer felt like an outsider? By this time, I was around 26 and feeling old compared to the typical professional dancer. But there were others who came from being a teacher or mechanical engineer, and they were just going for it. It was so encouraging to see other people on this journey.  Is it different being an Asian female hip-hop dancer in New Zealand versus New York? In New Zealand, most of the people who came to hip-hop classes were Islanders and Asians. We started out young and had courage from being naive, so it was never a thing. Here, it's different. The history of hip-hop lies here, coming from the African American community. Also, race definitely matters for casting or auditions. Just recently, I went to an open audition with three Asian dancers and 10 dancers from other backgrounds, and the 10 dancers were asked to stay. It's a liberal melting pot here, but I'm also more aware that I'm Asian. It's part of the industry, so you either roll with it or don't partake in it.  Do you prefer dancing or choreographing? What satisfies me about choreography is putting different elements of what I enjoy into one product. If I'm a dancer going into someone else's piece, you're not supposed to challenge the choreographer's vision. It's your job to make their work look great. I enjoy creating because you can put much more of yourself into it. It's harder because you have to show up first, invest in rehearsal space, and prep for rehearsals. With the rise of social media marketing for dancers and studios, how do you balance the work with making sure it's visible? It's a really great thing that dancers can take things into their own hands, using their own platform. The fact that dance videos are so popular online says a lot. If dance choreographers are making your songs more popular, there's value in that, but I don't feel dancers are usually credited or compensated enough for it. It's great that dancers and choreographers are more in the forefront and the world knows their names. At the same time, if you're from the older generation and did all this stuff before social media, it shouldn't discredit your work. If you've done all this work but it's simply not documented online, then it doesn't exist and you tend to lose out on work against people who have a million subscribers. I've seen choreographers post, ""We need a dancer who has at least two million subscribers."" So it's great to take things into your own hands, but you can lose out on jobs if you don't do it, even if you're an amazing artist. It can be a steep learning curve. Maybe you're just a more private person, you know?"
ENTERTAINMENT,"Mike Myers appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Wednesday. Naturally, the conversation got around to the recent death of Myers’ costar Verne Troyer, who played Mini-Me in two “Austin Powers” movies. Myers praised Troyer as a great physical comedian who elevated what was supposed to be a prop role “off the page.” But the best part of the chat was an anecdote Myers shared about his visit to the White House for a state dinner with President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. It basically summed up everything you need to know about how popular Troyer was. We’ll let Myers explain. “I met President Obama and he said, ‘Mike, so glad to see you. How’s Mini-Me?’ ... And I said, ‘He’s great.’” “Then I met Trudeau,” Myers told Kimmel. “He said, ‘Buddy, how’s it going? How’s Mini-Me?’” “Verne just brought so much love to people,” Myers said."
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― After weeks of describing June’s planned meeting with North Korea as all-consuming, President Donald Trump’s lawyer said the canceled summit does not mean Trump will soon be speaking with prosecutors investigating his campaign. “No,” Rudy Giuliani said with a laugh. “It means he can talk to me.” He said the cancellation of the Singapore meeting that had been set for June 12 gives him more time to work with Trump to decide next steps. “We could probably decide by June 12 whether to testify,” Giuliani told HuffPost on Thursday. That decision, though, will apparently hinge on whether Trump is given whatever report is produced following a Justice Department probe of the FBI’s use of an informant to learn about his campaign’s contacts with Russia. Trump demanded the review on Sunday following a coordinated effort by his Capitol Hill allies and conservative media to discredit the informant. “Are we going to get a report on ‘spygate’?” Giuliani said, using the term Trump invented this week. Giuliani allowed that, as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, he never would have turned over all of his investigatory material to a potential target in that manner. “But I wasn’t investigating the president,” he said, justifying the demand for the FBI informant details. “You cannot compel criminal process on the president.” Giuliani said he still would prefer for Trump to avoid Mueller completely. “I would not like to talk to Mueller at all,” he said. “I don’t see what you gain from that.” But, Giuliani added, Trump himself has the opposite opinion. “He has a strong view that he should testify,” Giuliani said. “He believes he’s telling the truth: He didn’t collude with the Russians and he didn’t obstruct justice.” Giuliani conceded that Trump’s habit of saying false things on a near-daily basis could create a problem for him. But, he added, that could be avoided if Trump had enough time to prepare for a session with Mueller. “If we sat him down for an interview, we would be careful that it would be a solid explanation,” Giuliani said. He added that he has not asked Trump to stop issuing tweets about the investigation ― based on his unsuccessful attempts to persuade Trump to stop tweeting during the 2016 campaign. “No use,” he said. “Didn’t work.” But Giuliani has come up with a strategy he thinks might be working: taking a higher profile with inflammatory public comments of his own. “It’s one of the reasons I’ve become so aggressive, so his tweeting would be confined to the subject that we’ve chosen for the day,” he said. Giuliani said the cancellation of the trip to Singapore next month opens up more time for him and Trump to plan strategy, in addition to the daily or twice-a-day phone calls they have been sharing. He said he met Trump for half an hour Wednesday evening in New York City, where Trump had traveled for a fundraiser. “That half hour was devoted to the investigation,” Giuliani said. The U.S. intelligence community concluded during the 2016 campaign that Russia was interfering in the U.S. election, and was actively trying to help Trump and hurt Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The FBI began its probe of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians well before Election Day. Control of the investigation was shifted to special counsel Robert Mueller after Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. Soon after, the president told NBC News, as well as senior Russian officials visiting the Oval Office, that he had done so because of the investigation. “The fact that he did it because of the Russian investigation is not obstruction of justice,” Giuliani said. “If he did it for that reason, that would be a legitimate reason to fire [Comey]. He works at the will of the president.” Mueller’s investigation has so far resulted in the guilty pleas of five individuals, including three former Trump campaign staffers, and the indictment of 14 other people and three companies. That total includes 13 Russians, Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and the Internet Research Agency “troll farm” that was used to create and disseminate propaganda to help Trump win. A related investigation by Giuliani’s former office is examining the dealings of longtime Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. A former business partner has agreed to cooperate in that probe and plead to New York State charges. Giuliani, though, said Mueller’s investigation thus far has been tangential to Trump, and asserted that none of those who have pleaded guilty or are under indictment have any information that can hurt Trump. “They haven’t gotten anyone to flip on this,” Giuliani said, using courthouse slang for those accused of crimes to testify against associates in return for leniency. “They’re not going to do it on the bullshit that they have. Manafort’s not flipping. Cohen’s not flipping. And he has nothing to flip about.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,"From a distance, Gina Adams’ quilts look familiar ― well-worn and stitched with intricate geometric patterns in vibrant colors, they wouldn’t look out of place draped on a couch at a rustic bed-and-breakfast. The closer one looks, however, the more unusual they look. Letters and words begin to leap out from the checkered colors, and still closer examination shows that the quilts are spelling out pieces of history. In this project, “Its Honor Is Here Pledged,” Adams sewed the words of broken treaties between the U.S. government and Native American tribes onto quilts, creating soft blankets with sharp messages. “Sewing together injustice with an object of comfort stirs deep emotion,” wrote Adams in her statement on the works.  In an email to The Huffington Post, the artist explained that seeing native people in America use quilts for warmth was a common theme in her research of old photos in the Smithsonian Museum and archives. “Blankets were one thing that was given to the Native people who were forced to move to the new reservations,” she wrote. “It is my wish that the viewer gain an understanding that there is a relationship between the treaty text and the impact that it still has on present generations.” To create the artworks, Adams used quilts she found in “antique stores, flea markets and gathered from dusty attics,” specifically seeking out faded, frayed and torn blankets. “I wanted to use a material that was created one hundred years ago,” she told HuffPost. “I feel the age in the quilt speaks to the language and implied weariness that still exists in the treaties.” On top of the aging fabric, she sewed letters cut from new and old calico ― a colorful cotton fabric. The swatches were carefully chosen to work together with and across the original quilt, “creating a rhythm” viewers are drawn into. The colors of the words weren’t chosen with an eye to clarity; Adams told HuffPost that she wanted “the fabric letters to blend and fade weaving in and out of the quilts surface.” It’s a visual strain to piece together the full text on a quilt, yet certain letters jump out, enticing one to read more closely. “The language of these treaties was meant to be confusing,” she wrote. “It’s 100 plus years later and the words still are today.” The many broken treaties signed by the U.S. government with Native tribes have been centuries-long grievances for those tribes, but have been more recently brought to the national media spotlight by protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline by the Standing Rock Sioux. The pipeline was rerouted to tunnels under Lake Oahe, near the Standing Rock reservation, which the tribe protested, in part, as a violation of the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie. “What is happening at Standing Rock is directly connected to the treaties and the protection that they give to Native American lands and water,” Adams pointed out. “In the treaties it is stated that not the United States nor any other corporation or company would ever be allowed to alter the territory stated with in them.” After taking office in January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order allowing the pipeline to move forward.  Apparent continuing violations of these treaties provide little hope for healing ― especially given the horrific treatment of the protesters, who refer to themselves as “water protectors,” encamped at Standing Rock. But Adams’ quilts are their own bid for recognition and healing, and she told HuffPost that they sprang from “the hope that change could occur.” That change would start, she said, with an apology, one given “out loud and directly from all United States Government... This apology would begin the process of healing for Native people of the United States who carry inherited trauma and pain... With these apologies, it would be possible that a great healing would begin.” That healing, she added, would only be the first step: “Once the healing begins, then the work of going back to the language of the original documents and taking accountability for all of the articles and promises that were given should happen.” “My hope was that present people would reconsider the need to reinvestigate the treaties,” she wrote. “Viewers come into the installed gallery space expecting to just see art quilts… they don’t expect the emotions they feel from the language that exists with the space. The beauty is that art does have the power to create ripples of change. If we don’t as a collective people start with small ripples the larger ones may never happen.” View some of Adams’s quilts below, and check out her work on her website.  H/T Hyperallergic"

POLITICS,"The Citrus County School District in Florida received two complaints about teacher Dayanna Volitich in the months before a March HuffPost article exposed her as the host of a white nationalist podcast, according to the results of a school district investigation. One complaint, filed by a parent last August, expressed concerns that Volitich was injecting political bias into her middle school classroom. Another complaint, made anonymously, informed administrators of Volitich’s Twitter alias, Tiana Dalichov, and of her racially incendiary musings online.  Following those complaints, the district monitored Volitich’s social media, made more visits to her classroom and interviewed students. But at the time, the kids did not substantiate the concerns about her teaching, and administrators did not notice anything out of line.  Earlier this year, HuffPost informed the district of a podcast in which Volitich brags about bringing her political views into her social studies classes. Following the HuffPost report, Volitich was removed from the classroom and an investigation was begun. In April, Volitich formally resigned from her post. This week the results of the investigation were released and reported by the Citrus County Chronicle.  The investigative report said that the inquiry had centered on whether Volitich violated “professional practices by being deceptive in changing her teaching practices when administration enters her classroom and by encouraging her students to go along with the deception.” Indeed, in a Feb. 26, 2018, podcast, Volitich said that when parents complained about her inserting her white nationalist opinions into her teaching, she lied to school administrators and said it wasn’t true.  The investigation found probable cause for disciplining Volitich. But because she has already resigned, the district will not be taking further action, according to the report.  Investigators interviewed 16 students and four other teachers. Most of the interviewed students had positive feelings about Volitich’s class and her ability as an educator. Most also said that she had a habit of discussing her political views in class, but denied that they were told not to inform their parents or encouraged to change the topic when administrators visited.  But five students said Volitich made them uncomfortable when she discussed topics like immigration, segregation, President Donald Trump and the Democrats. One student, who is biracial, told administrators that Volitich described the Ku Klux Klan as “a good thing,” called for immigration to be “shut down” and said segregation should be restored in schools. Another student said that Volitich told the class that Democrats believe they need help raising pets or children, whereas Republicans don’t believe they need help with such activities. Another said that Volitich would sometimes talk about how Hillary Clinton should be in jail and claim that Democrats want to raise your taxes. Of the four teachers interviewed, one expressed concern about Volitich injecting racial bias into her classroom practices and took issue with Volitich allegedly seating black male students together. The educator also described a tense conversation with Volitich about politics, in which the educator expressed fears that Trump would try to get rid of black people. In response, Volitich simply said, “Well,” the educator alleges.  The parent who had filed the complaint last August told investigators about new comments made to his son. Volitich allegedly told the child that “Google is down because the Democrats were busy helping to delete all Hillary Clinton’s e-mails.”  District officials did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on the results of the investigation. Volitich’s lawyer, Charles E. Moore, also did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Volitich’s answer to the allegations is included in the investigative report. She took issue with the inquiry’s results, suggesting that media coverage might have primed students to remember more innocuous comments. She also responded to many of the kids’ specific claims. In response to the allegation that she said Democrats need help raising pets and children, Volitich said she was teaching students about the two major political parties. Instead of arguing that Clinton belongs in jail, Volitich claimed that she said Clinton should be in jail if there is proof she committed a crime. Her comment about Google and Clinton’s emails was a joke, she said.  “Over 85% of the students interviewed stated they learned a lot in my class, felt they were able to express their own opinions and views, denied my telling them not to talk to their parents about material discussed in class,” Volitich wrote. She also vehemently disagreed with the one former colleague’s recollection of certain discussions.  The other teacher “admits no one but she and I were present for these conversations, and that she never reported anything to administration or to the district. Everything she claimed is mere hearsay, a terrible warping of the truth designed to smear my character,” Volitich wrote.  Jenna Amatulli contributed to this report."
BUSINESS,"Uber will not renew its permit to test self-driving cars in California, a decision the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles discussed in a letter to the company on Tuesday. The permit is set to expire March 31, but Uber indefinitely halted its autonomous vehicle testing nationwide following a fatal crash last Sunday night in Tempe, Arizona. The collision killed 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg as she walked her bike across a road, and was the first fatal crash between an autonomous vehicle and a pedestrian. “In addition to this decision to suspend testing throughout the country, Uber has indicated that it will not renew its current permit to test autonomous vehicles in California,” California DMV deputy director and chief counsel Brian Soublet wrote to Uber. Uber confirmed the news in a statement to PBS NewsHour: NEW: @uber confirms to me they’ve suspended self-driving operations in California, company will not reapply for the state DMV permit pic.twitter.com/JX3LHoL5Mu Should Uber want to begin testing in California again, the company will need to re-apply for a permit, a process that will require it to provide a thorough explanation of the crash in Arizona, Soublet wrote in his letter. “Prior to resuming autonomous vehicle testing operations in California, Uber must apply for a new autonomous vehicle testing permit” he added. “Any application for a new permit will need to address any follow-up analysis or investigations from the recent crash in Arizona and may also require a meeting with the department.” In deciding to let its permit lapse in the state where it’s headquartered, Uber’s decision carries more symbolic weight than strategic significance. The bulk of the company’s testing takes place elsewhere. Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group, the unit tasked with developing self-driving cars, is headquartered in Pittsburgh. Uber also has self-driving cars in Phoenix, San Francisco and Toronto. Uber was already on thin ice with California regulators. In 2016, the state gave Uber’s self-driving cars the boot after the company refused to get government approval to test there. Instead of applying for the $150 permits, Uber shipped its autonomous Volvo SUVs to Arizona, where regulations are more relaxed. Unlike Arizona, California requires car companies to report how often human drivers have to take over from the autonomous system, a hard measure of just how capable the car’s driving abilities really are. Given Uber’s reported engineering struggles, it would be to the company’s advantage to log more miles elsewhere. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) ordered the company to indefinitely suspend testing in his state Monday. "

Fallon congratulated her on the baby and asked how she was managing it all. “I don’t know if it’s the strength of the fetus, but I have never felt so hungry to succeed,” Cardi said in the clip above. She said she would have continued to keep quiet about expecting if not for the “meddling paparazzi” ― but just hearing the “hungry to succeed” line made us glad she could discuss.  "

BUSINESS,"“The secret of my success is that we have gone to exceptional lengths to hire the best people in the world.” — Steve Jobs Imagine if a music label stopped searching the world for the next sensation. Or fast-growing tech executives stopped tapping their networks to find the best engineers and marketers. It’s pretty easy to see what would happen. Each organization would eventually stagnate and die. You don’t need to be Sony Music or Steve Jobs to see that the same principle applies. That’s because in most organizations, the quality of the people you hire — particularly in key roles — can make or break a great organization. After all, today’s new recruit is tomorrow’s superstar. Bottom line? If you manage people — whether you’re an entrepreneur or Fortune 100 executive — you must also be a part-time talent scout. Because the task of future key hires is simply too important, too strategic — and too time-sensitive — to leave fully in the hands of others. Instill a culture of talent scouting  “I have three open positions; I was close on one, then the candidate said no. So, three months later, I’m back to square one.” — CFO What you sense is true: employees today are much harder to find and harder to keep. According to 2016 US Bureau of Labor Statistics, average tenures in America have decreased to 4.2 years — while a recent CompData survey shows a 13.5% voluntary exit rate (up sharply from 10.4% only 5 years ago) across all industries. That means if you’re not scouting for your key roles on an ongoing basis, you’re running the risk of a gap — and a long journey from a cold start — when a key person resigns. Then it’s a matter of hurry-up-and-wait: the process takes too long, promising people get snapped up by rival companies, and everyone ends up frustrated. That’s why it’s critical to instill a culture of talent scouting within your organization. After all, the opportunity cost of dealing with talent in a reactive, transactional way — of not having already scouted potential candidates, in collaboration with your search partners or internal recruiters — is probably higher than the incremental cost of making the mind-shift I’m suggesting here. Always be scouting Just as sales people need to mind their “ABCs” — always be closing — managers and leaders should spend a chunk of their time every week either looking for great talent to hire, or keeping their eyes peeled for talented people on the inside they could cultivate. The task is not as daunting as you may think. We’re living in an era of unparalleled connectivity and accessibility. Never before has professional talent been easier to scope out and contact. LinkedIn, Facebook and other social media can give you a great idea where to look. And they’re only the tip of the networking iceberg. Maybe part of the problem is that managers are not compensated for the scouting they’ve done, nor do they get bonuses for being “scout of the year,” or “closing” on candidates that were on scouting lists. Maybe they should. Be proactive: Take (more) ownership of recruitment If you’re scouting consistently for your key current roles and future needs, you should be sending a list of interesting potential candidates to your recruiters or search partners, and getting their feedback — not vice versa. Isn’t it more strategic to tell your recruiter or search partner, “Find out how we can get her in here in the next year or two,” than to say, “Go source me a list of people for VP of Sales”? And one other note: people sometimes return. So-called “boomerang hires” are increasingly commonplace — those high voluntary turnover rates also mean talent will sometimes fly right back to you. Part of instilling a scouting culture involves welcoming your best people back on their way out. When it comes to onboarding, you’re already halfway there. Great talent elevates everything Why is it worth it for managers and executives to incorporate scouting into their mindset and workflow? Because great talent is immeasurably valuable to an organization — a source of competitive advantage whose benefits accrete over time. Great talent elevates everything — your results, culture, morale, and your ability to lead. Instill in yourself and your team the expectation that scouting out great talent is a top priority. And you will, over time, advance what your organization is able to achieve, in a sustained way. In that sense, you can look at scouting as a gift that keeps on giving."
BUSINESS,"Whether you’re new on the job or you’ve been employed at your company for  while, everyone can use a lesson in improving how they listen at work. How many times have you been stuck in a meeting and zone out during a presentation or someone is speaking on a topic you have no interest in and you figure — why bother, so you end up checking your tweets or hop on Tinder and start swiping? But did you ever think you’re the one with the listening problem? Probably not. If you’re not walking out of meetings feeling inspired, productive, or accomplished, you should reevaluate your listening skills. Yes, there are a few meetings you’ll attend in your career that leave you wondering, “Why did this just happen and how do I get back the last 45 minutes of my life,” but if every meeting or gathering you attend leaves you feeling that washed out — something’s a miss and my bet is on your lack if paying attention. But you can fix all that with some self-awareness and practice. (And you can apply this to your relationships at home too)  There are two types of listening we can do, we either “listen for” or “listen with.” I’ll break down the two so you can quickly see the major difference between the two and how its been impacting your career. “Listening for” is the type of listening you do when you’re being receptive to ideas and open to suggestions. Someone is talking and you’re actually listening with the intent of grasping their concept, main idea, or information. The act of “listening for” will leave you with some type of insight and it’s the best type when you’re receiving feedback from a supervisor or a colleague. This type of listening will advance your career and accelerate your plans of climbing the success ladder. “Listening with” is the kind of listening that closes you off to what’s being said and shuts down any chance of truly having an exchange. This type of listening comes with baggage. You’re either listening with judgment, bitterness, or “fill in the blank.” You are too busy trying to get your point across that you’re missing the actual exchange and the opportunity to establish collaboration with another department, colleague, or better your relationship with your supervisor. Now, you may be mentally flipping through situations and thinking, but Penny in Payroll seems to always “listen for” and she gets trampled on and Sheri in Media is always “listening with” and she’s a hard core profit making machine for the company. It may seem like the good guy does’t always finish first, but my focal point is you — not them. What’s best for you and your career and where you want to go? Since listening usually involves two people, and you’re part of the equation, you want to make sure you’re not creating a hostile work environment and leaving behind a trail of negativity because you never know who will be listening when it’s time to switch companies and you’re on an interview for a new job with an old coworker."

 Lucy Jones with Her Walking Stick, 1996 Oil on canvas 218.5 x 157 cm 86 x 61 3/4 in  In ""Lucy Jones with Her Walking Stick,"" a woman wearing a green pullover sweatshirt and white pants stands before an ambiguous, unnatural purple backdrop. In one hand she clutches a black cane. Her pupils drift outward, her toes point inward. From the tilt in her head to the angles of her arms to the pop in her knee, Jones' body appears to exist on multiple axes, hunched and crunched like a wounded bird.  The arresting and unapologetic self-portrait is the work of 60-year-old painter Lucy Jones. Her current exhibition, ""How did you get on this canvas?"" is comprised of such striking portraits -- confrontational, awkward, defiant, other. As the show's title suggests, Jones is well aware of how rarely ""women like her"" are immortalized in paint. Women approaching and exceeding middle age, women who don't ooze overt sexuality, women battling physical and psychological impairments.  Jones presents herself as a foil to the classical nude odalisque, lounging sensually with politely averted eyes. Instead, she stares straight ahead, eyes vacant yet piercing, challenging the viewer to question her prerogative to exist on the canvas.  Jones studied painting at the Camberwell School of Art and the Royal College and had her first show in 1987 with an exhibition of landscapes at Flowers Gallery, where the Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired two of her paintings. Her rising success, however, was soon overshadowed by the conceptual art mania incited at a 1988 exhibition of Young British Artists, featuring individuals like Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, who opted for theory and irony over beauty, and used anything but paint.  With some distance from the limelight, Jones continued to paint, racking up a collection of gripping self-portraits that capture the awkward joys and crushing pains of being alive.
 Flushed, 2006 Watercolour pencil on paper 76 x 56 cm 30 x 22 1/4 in  Jones was born with cerebral palsy, which, according to the Mayo Clinic, is a disorder of movement, muscle tone or posture caused by an abnormality or disruption in brain development, usually before a child is born. Jones is also severely dyslexic, a condition that she believes has shaped her life more than her physical disability. However, without knowing about Jones' existing conditions, her self-portraits appeal to the challenges many of us, notably aging women, feel when confronting their reflections.  ""Painting myself has helped me come to terms with all sorts of aspects of myself: being a woman, being a wife,"" Jones told The Huffington Post. ""Looking at myself in the early work I was joining up two aspects: the very bad and the maybe okay. The frustrations that my dyslexia causes me are something that cannot be seen by others. There is a split between what people see -- the physical awkwardness, and what they cannot see –- such as dyslexia."" Due to her cerebral palsy, Jones literally suffers for her work too, struggling to find a position to paint in, kneeling for two or three hours at a time. Her artworks themselves, however, illuminate the more subtle side effects of living with a disability, such as reconciling her own understanding of self with the projected perceptions of outsiders. In her painting ""A Handful of Tears,"" for example, the word ""Fallen"" is etched backwards next to Jones' likeness, a term seemingly ascribed to her by the world's gaze. For years, Jones did not allow art critics to reveal or discuss her disabilities, fearing the fact would too greatly color the works themselves. ""Even now it is something I am wary of,"" she said. ""I am an artist, not a disabled artist. In my paintings, using me as a stand-in for being human, it became harder to discuss the painting without putting some explanation. I think my work speaks without my personal narrative attached to it as it covers the universal about how difficult it is to be human.""
 How did you get on this canvas?, 2013 Oil on canvas 180 x 120 cm 71 x 47 1/4 in  One distinctive element of Jones' paintings is their unabashed portrayal of sexuality. ""I felt sexless (unlike Frida Kahlo),"" Jones told the Financial Times about her ongoing battle with depression, echoing a sentiment endured by many women, so often expected to project a certain type of allure. In ""Flushed,"" a watercolored Jones stares head on in a frilly black bra, her face blushing feverishly though refusing to break her gaze. The image challenges the dominant assumptions that older women, especially those with disabilities, are not desired nor are they lustful.  Jones' paintings, in the tradition of artists from Rembrandt to Lucian Freud, explore the awkward, ugly, salty and raw aspects of being alive. With pigment as her language, she visualizes the ways that otherness not only isolates us, but unifies us. ""My work draws on the physicality of my movements to make paintings which, to my mind, are translated through the physicality of paint, a medium I have used all my life,"" Jones concluded. ""I see myself in a tradition of artists which include [Leon] Kossoff, [George] Baselitz and [Henri] Matisse, to name but a few. My work sits outside fashion, perhaps reflecting my feeling of being an outsider."" ""How did you get on this canvas?"" runs until May 9, 2015, at Flowers Gallery in New York City.  "
ENTERTAINMENT,"Well that was quick. “Deadpool 2” wasn’t even in wide release before it broke a box office record. The Marvel Studios film took in $18.6 million during its Thursday night preview release, setting an all-time record for money made by an R-rated film, according to Box Office Mojo. The film is also debuting in the most theaters ever for an R-rated film. The highly anticipated sequel, featuring Ryan Reynolds as the “Merc with a Mouth,” easily beat the previous record holder, 2017′s “It,” which had a preview night opening of $13.5 million. “Deadpool 2” officially hits theaters Friday and is expected to make anywhere between $130 to $150 million in its opening weekend. "
ENTERTAINMENT,"April 9 (Reuters) - The goofy voice behind the “I’m cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs” call for breakfast cereal fell silent Sunday, as comedian and voice actor Chuck McCann died, his publicist said. “His work was legendary,” said his publicist Edward Lozzi. “What baby boomer doesn’t know cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs?” The Brooklyn, New York, native died of congestive heart failure at a Los Angeles hospital at age 83, Lozzi said. Showbusiness was in his blood, Lozzi said. He practically grew up in an orchestra pit where his father was a big band leader at New York’s Roxy Theatre. His grandfather also performed in Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show. Through his family, McCann was exposed to some of the best comedians of the 1930s and 1940s and he would have his classmates in stitches imitating them at school, Lozzi said. He got his professional start in local radio and television doing voices, puppetry work and standup comedy. McCann later starred in scores of children’s television programs such as “Lunch with Soupy Sales” and “The Captain Kangaroo Show” and “Rootie Kazootie,” Lozzi said. McCann later moved to Los Angeles and worked as a character actor on shows including; “Little House on the Prairie,” “Bonanza,” and “Columbo.” But he is best known for voicing the hungry bird Sonny for General Mills cereal. “We all grew up with him,” Lozzi said. “He was a pioneer.” He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Fanning, and two daughters.  Fans, friends and colleagues took to Twitter to share tributes to McCann: So sad to hear of the passing of Chuck McCann. We were friends for over 60 years. Chuck was a walking encyclopedia of comedy. A self-appointed historian of Laurel and Hardy. He taught me how to do Stanley and we performed as that sweet duo... https://t.co/fN0A4hrVz6 I’m very sad to report that Chuck McCann has passed away at the age of 83.

We will miss him...Here’s my interview: https://t.co/LUaMQBShpG#DuckTales pic.twitter.com/8rwvNAYwNy Sad news has just reached us that Chuck McCann passed away today.  Chuck was a great man and was loved by many fans around the world. May he RIP. pic.twitter.com/p1D8SjKETq I never met Chuck McCann but every time I open my medicine cabinet I say, ""Hi guy!"" RIP A sad farewell to Chuck McCann, a funny man who had his own kids show in the NY area. He helped to keep Laurel and Hardy's legacy in the mainstream, acted in films, most notably The Heart is a Lonely Hunter and was a nice man whom many of us had the honor of calling a friend.

ENTERTAINMENT,"Kanye West admits in a new video that he doesn’t agree with “half the shit” President Donald Trump does, but still finds him “inspiring” for breaking the mold. In footage shared to West’s website late Monday, the rapper claims the Trump-autographed Make America Great Again hat he showed in his series of pro-Trump tweets last week (which caught Trump’s eye) wasn’t intended “to hurt” people who have been harmed under Trump’s presidency. Making of ye vs the people        https://t.co/1xvft3175J Instead, the hat was meant as “like a fight for equality,” West says. He also explains in the footage how he created his new song “Ye v The People” with fellow rapper T.I. Check out the “making of” video here: The song, released Friday, is a passionate debate between the two musicians on issues ranging from police brutality to Trump’s policies and identity. A sample of the lyrics: Kanye: I know Obama was heaven-sent,But ever since Trump won, it proved that I could be president. T.I.: Hm, yeah, you can, at what cost though?Don’t that go against the teachings that Ye taught for? Kanye: Yo, Tip, I hear your side and everybody talk though,But ain’t goin’ against the grain everything I fought for? T.I.: Prolly so, Ye, but where you tryna go with this?It’s some shit you just don’t align with and don’t go against. In the “making of” video, West tells T.I. that Trump’s “ability to do what no one said you could do, to do the impossible is the most inspiring thing to me.” Check out “Ye vs. The People” here:"
ENTERTAINMENT,"Sarah Paulson really should take her act on the road. The “Ocean’s 8” actress killed once again with her impressions on “The Tonight Show.” On Tuesday, she showed off her range ― from Holly Hunter to a dolphin ― and let host Jimmy Fallon know that Drew Barrymore herself had approved of her Drew Barrymore impersonation on a previous show. Despite the Barrymore thumbs-up, Paulson said she is expanding her repertoire to animals because “you don’t have to worry about running into them at a party.” Watch the fun above. We dare you not to laugh at her re-creation of Barrymore’s reaction."
POLITICS,"Pennsylvania is all but certain to finally have a woman in its 20-member congressional delegation next year.  Right now, Pennsylvania is the largest state without a woman in either the House or the Senate. The state’s never had a female senator, and the last woman to serve in its 18-member House contingent was Rep. Allyson Schwartz, a Democrat who retired in 2015. But Tuesday’s primaries brought big wins for women politicians in Pennsylvania. In the newly drawn 5th Congressional District, Republican Pearl Kim will face Democrat Mary Gay Scanlon in November, meaning that barring an unforeseen circumstance, at least one woman will be going to Congress from the state in 2019. The 5th district seat is being vacated by Rep. Pat Meehan (R), who announced he would be resigning after one of his female staffers accused him of sexually harassing her. Six women ran in the 10-candidate Democratic primary, more than in any other House district in the country. The seat leans Democratic. Kim is a former state prosecutor and Scanlon is a public interest lawyer. State Rep. Madeleine Dean (D) won in the 4th Congressional District, which is considered a safe Democratic seat. Elsewhere in the Keystone state, Democrats Chrissy Houlahan (6th Congressional District) and Susan Wild (7th Congressional District) won their primaries. They will face off against male Republicans for seats that Democrats are targeting to flip. Pennsylvania also lags behind in its female representation at the state government level, with women comprising just 19 percent of the members of its legislature."
POLITICS,"Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, a corporate attorney, won the Democratic nomination for Texas’ 7th Congressional District on Tuesday, reassuring national Democrats eager to flip the GOP-held seat. Fletcher’s win in a runoff reflects the preference of primary voters for a mainstream Democrat capable of appealing to enough of the affluent, suburban Houston district’s Republican voters. It also delivers a victory for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the official body charged with electing the party’s candidates to the House. The DCCC backed away from an active role in the campaign after provoking outrage among some progressives with a February opposition research memo against Fletcher’s more liberal opponent, Laura Moser. Fletcher finished first in a seven-candidate March primary, but the controversy over the DCCC helped propel Moser to a close second-place finish, setting up the runoff race. With Fletcher’s nomination, “Texas Democratic primary voters chose their heads over their hearts,” said Mark Jones, a Rice University political scientist who lives in the district. “Rather than opting for the aggressive progressive Laura Moser, they opted for the nearly equally liberal Lizzie Fletcher.” In November’s general election, Fletcher faces Rep. John Culberson, a nine-term Republican. Although Culberson has often easily won re-election, this year Democrats came out of the woodwork to challenge the deeply conservative congressman. Texas’ 7th is one of just three GOP-held districts in the state where voters narrowly opted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in he 2016 presidential vote, making it a prime Democratic pickup opportunity in the midterm elections. The district went for Clinton 49 percent to 47 percent, a sharp swing from 2012 when it went for Mitt Romney over Barack Obama by 21 percentage points. The devastating effect of Hurricane Harvey last year has also made Culberson more vulnerable than normal. He promoted the expansion of an interstate highway that some of his constituents believe left their neighborhoods more vulnerable to flooding. For the most part, however, the district’s sizable majority of so-called country-club Republicans remains loyal to the GOP. Any Democrat hoping to unseat Culberson will need to convert at least some voters who traditionally support Republicans down the line, but might appreciate a member of Congress willing to hold Trump more accountable. Fletcher, who supports abortion rights and shoring up the Affordable Care Act, is more moderate than Moser, a proponent of Medicare-for-all and founder of the anti-Trump “Resistance” text-message app, Daily Action. Perhaps more important than policy distinctions, the two candidates differed in their styles. “Without question, Fletcher’s rhetoric and style were much more consensual and less anti-Republican and anti-Trump,” Jones said. While Fletcher had the endorsement of the establishment-linked group EMILY’s List, Moser drew support from less well-heeled progressive grassroots groups like Democracy for America and Our Revolution, the successor group to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign. Fletcher’s win is also a major setback for organized labor, which bitterly opposed her bid. She was anathema to regional labor unions because she is a partner at AZA Law, a firm that represented a Houston janitorial services company in a dispute with the Service Employees International Union, which was seeking to unionize the company’s workers.  AZA successfully won a $5.3 million lawsuit against the state’s SEIU chapter, forcing it to declare bankruptcy. AZA Law also boasts on its website of successfully defending a Houston-based oil equipment supplier against a discrimination lawsuit filed by eight current and former African American employees. Fletcher did not work on either of the cases but as a partner, she profited from them indirectly."
BUSINESS,"As a lawyer who spent 11 years settling large insurance claims and negotiating attorney’s fees with some of the most contentious opposing counsel, I learned various tricks and tools that helped me excel in the process and even during the dreaded salary negotiations talks in job interviews. My strategies enabled me to acquire hefty salary increases at subsequent roles and even during performance reviews. I have since leveraged that experience and skill set in job search strategy sessions with career coaching and resume clients, which have included a payoff to many in the form of $20,000 or more.  I believe that one of the key issues job seekers have is feeling that they are not getting paid what they are worth. But here’s the flip side to that: if you don’t have the experience or skill set, it’s hard to leverage that worth. As they say, you must “pay your dues” and gain the experience in order to have the leverage.  So, how exactly do you negotiate the salary you deserve?  Well, I want to tell you exactly how to do it through the following steps: Know Your Strategy Ahead Of Time Like any good negotiator, you must plan ahead and work your plan at the time of the salary talk. My top tip is always to go into the salary discussion knowing the information. That means you need to research what competitor companies are paying someone at your level, and what the fair market value is for someone at your level. This information can be acquired online easily through sites such as Glassdoor and PayScale. Remember, it’s not about what you think you deserve, but rather what companies are actually paying employees who have similar credentials and skills that you possess. Don’t Focus On Your Current Salary Or Past Salary Many times, career professionals will focus only on the number they are making (or were making in the past) and dwell on that number rather than looking to what the fair market value is paying. If you focus too much on your current salary or past salary, you will find that the conversation centers around negativity, frustration, and disgust. Yes, companies may ask what you are currently making, but when you give your current salary number, do not forget to add what similar companies are paying someone at your level and don’t forget to factor in the additional compensation perks (bonuses, benefits, vacation time, award earnings, etc.) that you are earning. It’s not just about your current paycheck. You need to look at the big picture of your entire compensation package. Do Not Bid Against Yourself This is the most important piece of advice. Never (I repeat NEVER) throw a number out there that causes you to bid against yourself. You could be giving too low of a number or even worse: a number that is out of the ball park that completely disqualifies you from moving forward in the interview process. Remember this bold statement: in business, it’s all about what you negotiate not what you think you deserve. Let the prospective employer know the range of what other employers are currently considering you for. Tell them you are open and negotiable, but also remind them of your clear objective: to have long-term growth at an organization. An important takeaway from this is that giving a range is always better than a hard number? Why? When you give a range, you are demonstrating flexibility and employers always prefer flexibility and versatility in an employee.  Consider The Power Of The Counteroffer  Like any good negotiator, it’s often expected that you will not accept the first offer given to you. Allowing the employer to provide you an offer gives you the power to counteroffer. But, don’t get into a bidding war of going back and forth multiple times with the number. Give one counteroffer and then make your decision.  At the end of the day, salary is important in a job or career, but your happiness and long-term goals are just as important. Consider all of the options, and create a pro and con list before making any decision to accept a salary offer. Remember, show your enthusiasm, but do not be afraid to ask for a few days to consider the offer. Thinking things through and weighing your options will help you make the right objective decision rather than being impulsive and possibly regretting that decision at some later point.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Tony Kushner is known for many things: He wrote the deeply resonant play “Angels in America,” a seven-hour, Pulitzer Prize-winning production about the AIDS epidemic under President Ronald Reagan. He co-authored the screenplay for the Oscar-nominated film “Munich” and penned the entirety of the screenplay for the Oscar-winning film “Lincoln.” His next project: A play about President Donald Trump. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Kushner explained that he’s in the beginning stages of developing a theater work geared around the “nightmare” that is Trump’s ascendance to the White House. He recognizes that it’s early to be crafting a play that addresses a man who’s been in office for only half a year ― “It certainly feels like folly that I or anyone else has a definitive understanding or comprehensive understanding of what going on.” ― but nonetheless, he’s writing it.  Here’s what we know: The play won’t necessarily center on President Trump; rather, it will take place in the two years before he was elected. And its pre-White House character won’t be symbolic like the Public Theater’s “Julius Caesar” figure, dressed to appear like Trump but not actually be Trump. Kushner’s Trump will unequivocally be Trump. So what does Kushner think of the man in charge? He’s the kind of person, as a writer, I tend to avoid as I think he is borderline psychotic. I definitely think that incoherence lends itself well to drama, but he really is very boring. It’s terrifying because he has all the power, but without the mental faculties he ought to have. I think he is seriously mentally ill, and the fact that he is in the White House is very frightening. “He is precisely the kind of person who you would not want to be stuck next to at a party,” he added, before affirming that comparisons between Trump and Hitler are not misplaced. “You can’t get away from how grotesque [Trump] is. Reagan was really disgusting too, but not as venal.” Kushner’s play might not be finished by the end of Trump’s first term. (“I find writing difficult,” Kushner said, giving budding playwrights everywhere some sense of hope.) In the meantime, those interested in reading a few other famous writers’ takes on the Trump era can check out Howard Jacobson’s Pussy, Naomi Klein’s No Is Not Enough, or stay tuned for Salman Rushdie’s The Golden House, out this September."
POLITICS,"Following another school shooting, this one leaving 10 dead and 13 injured in Texas, Houston’s police chief is calling out elected officials for their failure to protect the children they claim to hold so dear. Police Chief Art Acevedo posted a pained message on Facebook after Friday’s shooting in the nearby town of Santa Fe, in which a 17-year-old student at Santa Fe High School gunned down his classmates and a teacher. No one ― not even the terrified kids themselves ― seemed to be all that surprised, with one student telling the local news she felt “eventually it was going to happen here too.” Acevedo said he has had enough inaction when it comes to protecting children. “Today I spent the day dealing with another mass shooting of children and a responding police officer who is clinging to life,” the police chief wrote Friday. “I’m not ashamed to admit I’ve shed tears of sadness, pain and anger.”  He had a message to those who would choose their guns over the safety of kids. “I know some have strong feelings about gun rights, but I want you to know I’ve hit rock bottom and I am not interested in your views as it pertains to this issue,” he said.  Friday’s massacre was the 22nd school shooting of 2018. It is only May.  The police chief previously marched with demonstrators during the March 24 March for Our Lives event, held in response to the Feb. 14 mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school that left 17 dead. “This isn’t a time for prayers, and study and inaction, it’s a time for prayers, action and the asking of God’s forgiveness for our inaction (especially the elected officials that ran to the cameras today, acted in a solemn manner, called for prayers, and will once again do absolutely nothing),” Acevedo added."

Thine ears hear deeper than thine eyes can see.
Voice of the monstrous mill, the shouting mart,
Not less of airy cloud and wave and tree,
Thou, thou, if even to thyself unknown,
Hast power to say the Time in terms of tone.""

                     --Sidney Lanier, 1877
Sidney Lanier In the years before the High Line emerged as the new epicenter of New York City's high culture, my sister Ellen and I were browsing in one of the West 22nd Street art galleries that foretold of West Chelsea's transfiguration from the meatpacking district and late-night gay cruising scene. The gallery's featured artist was someone neither of us had heard of. Ellen, an environmentalist and artist whose progressive politics are more discernible in her probing photography of the ordinary and downtrodden than in her watercolor landscapes with their subtle pastels, was pleased by what she was seeing. What did I think? Yes, I agreed, the paintings were sensual and abstractly appealing. But I felt I had to know more about the artist and the subject and context of the art before I could render an opinion.  Dinner with Hilan Warshaw at Café Tallulah, a French bistro on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Warshaw is the creator of several music documentaries, including Wagner's Jews and Lyric Suite, a work-in-progress which tells the background story of Alban Berg's previously unknown affair with a Jewish woman and features a performance of the work with Renee Fleming and the Emerson String Quartet. Hilan and I are mostly on the same page about Wagner, frustrated at how difficult it is to get beyond the controversies that continue to waft within and around Wagner's works and their appreciation. Though we are in agreement against any kind of censorship in principle, Hilan wondered if he should expose his baby son to Wagner's music.  Aesthetics discourse has a long history. Every orientation has been articulated and labored over. The one reflected by me in reaction to my sister's question is not widely endorsed: that initial impressions of art cannot be trusted. People do not want to be told that their spontaneous reactions to music or paintings need vetting. And in truth, I accept and respect their viewpoint as one I myself otherwise might endorse. Because of how much pain love-at-first-sight/hearing intoxication with art eventually caused me, however, I have been aversively conditioned to approach art with a lot more caution. Because of the fallout for me personally of my love of Wagner, all art has become suspect, guilty until proven innocent, and my reactions to it henceforth must be cleared through security and sobriety checkpoints, like screening passengers at airports and museums for weapons, or testing for blood alcohol levels. Like someone who slowly realizes they were raped, abused or otherwise exploited and will henceforth meet all romantic overtures with guardedness, or Holocaust survivors who reflexively distrust, I am now reprogrammed to never again allow myself the freedom to fall head over heals in love with art. _____ Richard Boch, a doorman at the Mudd Club, is completing a book about his experience there. He wanted to interview me about my brother, Steve Mass, who collaborated with several others in the creation of the club in 1977. With inchoate misgivings, I agreed to speak with Richard, with whom I was otherwise acquainted, but I withdrew when I sensed that this would not be the right venue for me to try to express myself about Steve and our estrangement.
                                                                 _____                  I look at the two best-known photographs of Steve, of him in a plaid suit and another with him looking like the proverbial mad scientist, leering out with one eye, like a gecko, as he looks with the other through a microscope like the one or perhaps the very one my father the pathologist had at home when we were growing up. The plaid suit appears to be a costume or fashion statement of some kind, the mad scientist a fantasied ""Dr. Mudd."" These are fictional personae, I think to myself, and their creator is someone I never really knew. The reasons for that are so various and elusive that I've decided to embark on these reflections to help me do what writing is best at--recouping people, places, things and times from memory and history, in hopes of giving them context and perspective.  Plaids, in curtains, upholstery and clothes--like those of the Catholic school uniform skirts that became mandatory in America in the 1940's, and the madras plaid shirts favored by Steve's high school peers--were in style in the 1950's America where Steve came of age... Steven Arnold Mass, nearly six years my senior, was born in Macon, Georgia, in 1940. Not an optimum time or place for Jews, to say nothing of gays. Steve wasn't gay but, unbeknownst to both of us during a time when even the word ""homosexuality"" was so taboo that it was virtually never uttered or even written, I was.  A German American family down the road had a sign in their driveway that read ""No Dogs or Jews Allowed."" Later, I learned that ""No Dogs or [substitute any immigrant group] Allowed"" was a not uncommon posting in the history of so-called melting-pot America. Though I knew we were Jewish, such was my disconnection with our Jewishness that I'd no idea this had anything to do with me, and so I would play there with the other boys, searching the abandoned and overgrown pool for turtles and snakes.  Likewise down the street was my best boyhood friend, Chester, whose American-Gothic lookalike mother ranted endlessly about ""niggers,"" and who later decided to forbid Chester to play with me because I was a Jew, which made me cry. Chester's dad worked at a gas station. I think they were Klan members. The Klan was very active in our area. Crosses were burned and when we were children, it was said that a black man had been hanged in front of one of the downtown's 2 movie theaters.  This was the Southern heartland--with its pervasive mentality of bigotry and intolerance, of cruelty, meanness and hatred--that Tennessee Williams captured in his play Orpheus Descending. It's the South that never really surrendered to the North and that has been key to the rise of the present-day carpetbagger Donald Trump. Such was the stigma we felt about being Jewish that we kids would walk on opposite sides of the streets of the town's two Jewish houses of worship, both of which our family belonged to--the orthodox synagogue (""Schul""), Temple Sherah Israel, where Steve was bar mitzvah'd, and the reformed temple, Beth Israel, where my sister was confirmed, and where we all got dressed up in costumes for the Jewish holiday Purim.  Just as Verdi's Nabucco captures key aspects of our conflicts in Iraq with startling prescience, so Purim likewise fortells of those with Iran. Haman, the King's confidante who attempts to foment genocide against the Jews, has his precise counterparts today in former prime minister Ahmedinejad and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Meanwhile, Esther's ascendancy as Queen, and thus with the power to denounce Haman and influence the King favorably with regard to the Jews, has its admittedly troubled reincarnation in Ivanka Trump's marriage to an orthodox Jew.  I remember choosing to dress as King Ahashueras after my initial taboo choice of Queen Vashti who, in contrast to natural-beauty, plainly-dressed Esther, got to wear a lot of jewelry. Early gay longings entangled with Jewish lore and festivity.  Meanwhile, outside those confines of Temple and Schul, consciously or unconsciously, we kids would seize every opportunity to minimize our status as Jews. As mandated by our parents, we attended Friday Sabbath and holiday services, Sunday school and Hebrew school, but with the same enthusiasm we had for going to the dentist.  I remember once seeing our rabbi crying, frustrated at the difficulty of successfully imparting what he felt we needed to know about being Jewish and Judaism. Sadness. Weakness. Not things we wanted to feel or be around.
Temple Sherah Israel, Macon, Georgia However thick the ambient anti-Semitism, I don't recall any major incidents of anti-Semitic violence during the years of our upbringing, like the notorious Leo Frank lynching in Atlanta in 1913, and the crimes of racism that remained commonplace. And as it turns out, the South has deep Jewish roots, communities that went way back, preceding the Civil War. This was true of Macon and elsewhere in Georgia, especially Atlanta and Savannah, and in neighboring states, and it included some who figured prominently in the history and heritage of the South, like Confederacy treasurer Judah Benjamin and David Emmanuel, the first Jewish U.S. governor. The University of Georgia Law School is named after Harold Hirsch, a prominent Atlanta attorney. As during the French Revolution, Jews found themselves on both sides of the American Civil War and a principal scapegoat of neither, a situation that seemed to lay the groundwork for a future of relative security. As for the episodic, disturbing, regrettable and mostly tragic history of Jewish collaborations, however circumstantial, with racists and fascists--e.g., Mussolini--it continues today with the rise of Donald Trump and Jewish extremists in Israel.
Temple Beth Israel, Macon, Georgia Growing up in Macon, Steve excelled at ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps, which still recruits students in high schools as well as at colleges) at Lanier High School, where he became adept at the operation of a rifle they gave him to keep and practice with at home, graduating from a bb gun he handed down to me, having taught me how to use it to shoot birds and squirrels.  The school was named after the revered Macon poet, musician and educator Sidney Lanier, whose Wagnerism New Yorker music critic Alex Ross has commented on but whose military service in the Confederacy he has not.  Ross keeps chalking up Wagnerites from a wide range of backgrounds in efforts to demonstrate that the composer's influence has been so great, so vast and varied as to subsume ongoing concerns about his legacy of anti-Semitism. Meanwhile, and notwithstanding Lanier's later distancing of himself from his Confederate service and support for slavery, efforts continue in Houston to change the name of its Lanier Middle School because of the name's association with the Confederacy.  The move to rename Lanier Middle School is not the only such initiative. Also in Texas, this time in Austin, the school board voted to change the name of Robert E. Lee Elementary school. According to CNN, ""the decision came amid a larger trend of questioning Confederate memorials across the American South, given the Confederacy's legacy of violence, racism and white supremacy.""  More recently, as reported in the New York Times, the Washington National Cathedral, one of the nation's most prominent houses of worship, said that it will remove two images of the Confederate battle flag that have been part of its stained-glass windows for more than 60 years. When I discussed this story with my closest friend, Joel Bradley, a liberal Southerner-New Yorker and distinguished addiction treatment specialist in employee assistance programs who hails from Elberton, Georgia and whose grandfather fought in the Confederacy, we both wondered if some efforts to eliminate emblems of historical events haven't gone too far. Though the name of Richard Wagner is not the equivalent of the swastika or Confederate flag, and it's certain that Wagner will continue to be a leading presence in musical culture, it seems likely that in much the same vein that Southern institutions and landmarks are being scrutinized and cleansed of Confederate symbols and associations, future generations of Germans, Europeans and others will deprioritize Wagner from consideration for some name designations he might otherwise have claimed--for institutes, schools and landmarks. At home and with straight faces, Steve, Ellen and I would march around the room singing the Christian hymnals we had to sing at school. (Our parents advised us to just mush-mouth any references to Jesus.) ""Onward Christian soldiers, marching off to war, with the cross of Jesus...Jesus loves me, yes I know, Father Bible tells me so.""  And of course, ""Dixie"": ""Oh, I wish I were in the land of cotton..."" To say that old times there in Dixieland were not forgotten, specifically the glory days of the plantations and Confederate heroes like Robert E. Lee, whose birthday we still celebrated at school, would be as big an understatement as you could make about the  post-Reconstructionist South we called home.  We were too young to have a real awareness of our outsiderness, even as we could sense the distress it caused our parents. Though my father seemed welcome in all circles,  following the period of his medical education when many institutions had quotas for Jews, my mother's encounters with the shut doors of the Junior League--remember Ms Hilly in The Help?--were hurtful.  At home, meanwhile, our parents tried to acculturate us. Dutifully, I practiced piano, which I had no real penchant for. For my first and last recital, I played ""From the Halls of Montezuma To The Shores of Tripoli."" I guess our involvement in Libya goes way back. Who knew? I was never to become a musician, but my love for music did evolve from childhood crushes on Elvis Presley, the Everly Brothers, Jerry Lee Lewis, Theresa Brewer and Brenda Lee, whose hairdresser I was to meet and befriend years later at the baths in Fort Lauderdale. His clientele was mostly elderly women in senior residential facillities. At their first session, he would patiently explain: ""This is a comb, not a wand."" From my first vinyl 45 rpm (revolutions per minute) rock-and-roll records to Broadway show LP (long-playing) albums like My Fair Lady, I eventually moved on to what became the first great love of my life, opera, and its Grand Poobah, Richard Wagner.  In those same childhood years I labored over one of my first books, James Michener's The Bridges at Toko Ri, which won a Pulitzer Prize and was made into a 1954 Hollywood film starring William Holden, Grace Kelly, Frederic March and Mickey Rooney. It's about the war with North Korea which, like the Civil War, and for that matter the Crusades, and for that matter again the American Civil War, we are still playing out. Though I never became a voracious reader, my interest in things literary developed in tandem with my love for music and opera.  At school we read The Jungle Book and Lazy, Liza Lizard, and our teacher would model the costumes she acquired from her around-the-world tour, one of which, a kimono, set the stage for my first opera, Madama Butterfly. I can't remember at which of Macon's two historic universities it played--Mercer, named for Jesse Mercer, a prominent Baptist minister, or Weslyan College, one of America's first women's colleges and a birthplace of alumnae associations and sororities. More than a half century later, In ""Racism on Campus, Stories from New York Times readers,"" one Weslyan graduate recalled, ""The racial diversity at my college was basically all brochure pictures and no substance."" Meanwhile, it was just this otherness that seemed the matrix of my brother's inimitable intelligence and wry, often twisted humor. Sensing our difference from the mainstream of Southern society, Steve, my sister and I were drawn to black singers of the times who appeared locally and later became legends, especially Little Richard, who in fact hailed from Macon. Just as these musicians were breaking through racial barriers by sheer talent, appeal and box office success, they gave inspiration to all outsiders, Jews prominent among them. But it wasn't until our move to Chicago that I attended my first concert with one of these legends--Ray Charles, whose ""Georgia on My Mind,"" written by Hoagy Carmichael in 1930, became the state's official song in 1979.   Enter Jayne Mansfield and her 1956 film, The Girl Can't Help It. The title song by Little Richard, and two other of his biggest hits, ""Ready Teddy"" and ""She's Got It,""  helped make what was otherwise this B-est of B movies into one of the richest assemblages of period pop music on film, featuring such other leading artists of the day as Gene Vincent, Fats Domino, Eddie Cochran, Julie London, The Platters, Ray Anthony, Johnny Olenn, The Bell Boys, Abbey Lincoln, Eddie Fontaine, and Teddy Randazzo and the Three Chuckles. Outside the theater where the movie played, incidentally, was where the Klan was said to have carried out its lynching. The year before, Mansfield's co-star Edmund O'brien was the villain in another film that offered rich hearings of pop era greats, Pete Kelly's Blues. Starring Jack Webb of early television cop drama Dragnet fame and the legendary Peggy Lee, it had cameos with the likes of Ella Fitzgerald, and, as a cigarette girl, Jayne Mansfield. Squeak! It's hard to imagine more fertile soil for someone with a good ear for music and talent. Even in the heyday of the Mudd Club, however, I don't remember Steve ever singing a refrain or humming a tune in a way that reflected straightforward affection for it. Rather, in those 1950's years of our childhood and adolescence, he would exaggerate and parody singers and songs, the hits we all loved but especially the crooned renditions of standbys like ""Fascinating Rhythm"" by popular B-list singers like Julius LaRosa, Marguerite Piazza, Perry Como and Dinah Shore. What Steve seemed to be trying to convey was his weisenheimer sense that the decorum we were seeing and hearing in mainstream entertainment and society was artificial, insipid, sentimental, ennervated, desexed, hypocritical, and funny as such. In Steve's sensibility, that artifice became the basis of what Susan Sontag would later become known for identifying as ""camp."" Steve was not gay, but he had what we gay people thought of as our special instinct for subverting social pretense with exaggeration, humor, affection and nostalgia. A droll and insightful if never exactly hilarious observer of people, and especially of 1950's culture, Steve was nonetheless an offshoot of the Jewish comedians we saw on our 12"" black-and-white Motorola TV who endeared themselves to mainstream America by using wit and facetiousness to upend provincialism and prejudice--Groucho Marx, Milton Berle, Sid Ceasar, Phil Silvers. Later, there was Lenny Bruce and eventually Woody Allen. At his most imaginative, Steve was the creator, operator-in-chief and behind-the-scenes (mostly) star of a Cabaret-style panoply of retro and cutting-edge fashions, design, theater, personalities, politics, happenings, musics and arts. At his more sardonic and reclusive, he was a shadowy figure from a performance artwork by Mudd Clubbers Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed. How else to react to what was expected of Steve--daily ROTC exercises and daily application of the phylacteries my mother's Orthodox Jewish mother insisted on? Obediently but with that mix of pride and irony, arrogance and defiance that became hallmarks of his personality, Steve did both, meanwhile excelling among his genteel, gentile Southern peers in two key areas. Though he had to endure a lot of hazing, doubtless some or more than some it anti-Semitic, he became an Eagle Scout, a serious achievement for any young man at that time; and he was so good at golf, the ultimate entree into Southern male society, that his picture was featured with several other state champion team members in the Macon Telegraph.  Steve was on his way, to be sure, but from Georgia to where? I don't think Steve ever thought of himself as belonging to the beats or any other movement, school, party, decade or even generational divide. Like people in recovery, and as stated in their preamble, Steve was not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution. But it was Jack Kerouac rather than recovery that could have been speaking for Steve when he wrote in 1957, ""Nothing behind me, everything ahead of me, as is ever so on the road.""    to be continued"
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― A month after abruptly resigning from Congress in an apparent effort to avoid more fallout from sexual harassment allegations, former Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) already has a new job: lobbying his former colleagues on port issues. Farenthold announced Monday on a Corpus Christi radio show that he landed a new gig at the Calhoun Port Authority in Port Lavaca, Texas, as reported by Caller Times. He is now the port’s full-time legislative liaison, and his job responsibilities include increasing the port’s visibility with federal lawmakers and the Trump administration. Port Lavaca sits on the Texas coast some 70 miles northeast of Corpus Christi. “I’m starting a new job today that has an hour-and-a-half commute,” Farenthold said on 1360 KKTX-AM’s “Lago in the Morning.” “You’re going to have me listening and calling in a whole lot now.” It is generally illegal for a former member of Congress to immediately become a lobbyist, but there are exceptions for those lobbying for state or local government agencies. Caller Times reports that Farenthold’s annual salary will be $160,000. That’s roughly double the amount he spent in taxpayer money to settle a 2014 sexual harassment lawsuit brought against him by his former aide Lauren Greene. Greene alleged in legal documents that the Texas congressman had told another aide that Greene could “show her nipples whenever she wanted to” and that he had “wet dreams” about her. She described Farenthold as often being drunk and flirtatious at work, complaining of a sexless marriage, and telling her a story about a female lobbyist who propositioned him for “a threesome.” Farenthold spent $84,000 in taxpayer funds to quietly settle that lawsuit. When the news broke this past December, he vowed to quickly pay the money back but never did. By April, with the House Ethics Committee close to wrapping up a probe into more office misconduct, he quit Congress. The good news for the ex-lawmaker is that he can now repay taxpayers for the settlement and still have $76,000 left of his salary. Not bad!* Randy Boyd, the chairman of the six-member board that oversees the Calhoun Port Authority, did not return a request for comment on why Farenthold was a good hire. Charles Hausmann, the director of the Calhoun Port Authority, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. *Farenthold is already worth millions of dollars. Come on, guy."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Comedians Will Ferrell and Molly Shannon blessed us all back in January when their characters Cord Hosenbeck and Tish Cattigan hosted the 2018 Rose Parade. The parody of vapidly chipper live-TV commentators is one they both seem born to play. On Saturday morning, they covered the royal wedding of Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle for HBO. And it was so much better than the real thing. Let’s start with the couple’s kiss in front of the public, where Cord and Tish lose their damn minds. Every kiss begins with..... #RoyalWedding #CordAndTish pic.twitter.com/iDJ0UIrtR5 During a procession of horses, Cord reveals that he’s afraid of the animals. “Everything about them makes me nervous,” Cord says. “Their round feet, their wet noses, their bigness.” Tish jumps in to help her colleague by trying a little exposure therapy, showing him a small horse figurine to help him become more comfortable around the beasts. It didn’t go well. Horses, they're too close to humans. #RoyalWedding #CordAndTish pic.twitter.com/fWiBUH1q6c Cord had another awkward moment when the newlyweds were expected to emerge from the church and he jumped the gun on popping the Champagne. “I just got too darn excited!” he said.

Good news: there's an encore tonight at 9:45PM on #HBO. pic.twitter.com/97YzyhOVGP HBO will be showing an encore of Cord and Tish’s royal wedding coverage Saturday night at 9:45 p.m. Eastern.

ARTS & CULTURE,"My new novel, Kissing in America, is a feminist story about a young girl coming into her own as she gradually understands the complexities of grief and loss and love. As I wrote the book over the course of seven years, I kept thinking back to seven books I read when I was a teen, narratives that seeped under my skin and shaped who I am. Although they're not all traditional YA titles, they have great appeal to young adults, regardless of whether or not the books were published or marketed as YA. (In the words of Patrick Ness: ""YA is not a genre. It contains all genres."") I can't imagine how I would have survived adolescence--or adulthood--without them.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Since I started My Year of TED in 2011, I've found myself explaining TED quite a lot. Last week I had to do this again, and I was reminded of a blog post I did in 2012. I thought I'd share it with you here -- noting that there have been hundreds of new talks since this time, but I think these still hold as a great introduction to TED. It's not easy to convey just how fantastic TED Talks are and how life changing they have been in my life. So I thought that I should do a post for people who may not be familiar with TED, a post that points you in the direction of what I think are the best talks for you to start with. I would almost guarantee that after watching this small selection you will be hooked. There are about 75 talks referenced on My Year of TED site, many of which I used in my project. To make it easier to know where to start, below is a list of nine talks that I think would give someone new to TED a great introduction to the type of talks and inspiration you can take from the site. I found it extremely hard to limit this list, there are just so many amazing talks full of incredible ideas and inspirational stories. There is one other talk that I would include in the list except that it is not actually a TED Talk (it is a curated talk), and it is over an hour long. It is the talk that I was Stumbled onto, the talk that led to me discovering TED many  years ago. It is Randy Pausch: Really achieving your childhood dreams, a truly inspirational talk that has a bit of everything. Watch this, it will change your life, even if it's only for a little while."
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― A mostly non-Christian militia linked to a brutal Iranian-backed paramilitary group secured two of the five seats in Iraq’s parliament reserved for Christians, according to official election results announced Saturday. The militia, known as the Babylon Brigade, doesn’t represent Christians at all, local leaders and international advocates for Iraqi Christians warn. They say the militia’s candidates, though Christian, won only because of help from Shiite Muslims. And Iraqi Christians are calling on President Donald Trump to live up to his statements of concern for Middle East Christians by pressuring Iraqi authorities to invalidate the results. But so far, the Trump administration has said nothing on the issue. Rayan al-Kildani, a Christian associated with various militias, founded the Babylon Brigade in 2014 when ISIS swept through Iraq and began hunting down religious minorities. Al-Kildani brought together 1,000 fighters and soon became the most prominent Christian in the popular mobilization, an umbrella group of Iraqi militias that fought ISIS with U.S. help. Along the way, he forged close ties with the Badr Organization, a historically brutal armed group that receives support from the Shiite leadership of Iran. Most of Al-Kildani’s fighters aren’t Christians, national security experts say, but members of the non-Christian Shabak ethnic minority or Iraq’s Shiite Muslim majority. Al-Kildani’s chief value to the mostly Shiite leaders of the popular mobilization forces was in propaganda. “He’s used like a quisling character to put a Christian face onto these militias,” said Michael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, a think tank focused on Middle East policy. Al-Kildani has “nothing to do with the morality of Christ ... [and] does not represent Christians in any way,” the church of Louis Sako, a top Iraqi priest who’s now a cardinal-designate, said in a statement last year. Al-Kildani didn’t win the parliamentary seats because of support from the Christian community but because of his ties to groups like Badr, his opponents fear. His candidates received thousands of votes from heavily Shiite cities that have no known Christian communities, said Asaad Kalasho, the U.S. representative for the Christian town of Tel Keppe. “He did get votes from Christians … [but] there’s no way that he won based solely on those Christian votes,” said Yousif Kalian, a program assistant at the United States Institute for Peace who has written on Al-Kildani’s militia. “Many [Christians] feel he doesn’t represent their interests largely because of connections to Badr and to Iran.”  One Christian party whose representatives had a post-election meeting at the State Department is formally challenging the seat allocation. And Sako said the results show Christians need to “learn a lesson” about securing political power. Activists believe that rather than advocate for the Christian minority, the Babylon Brigade’s representatives in parliament will be most concerned with tipping the scales in favor of the Badr Organization, which secured the second-largest seat total in parliament. Kalasho said he sees the situation as evidence that the entire election was flawed — echoing complaints of irregularities elsewhere that the U.S. has said should be investigated. Strong representation, the advocates argue, is crucial to help Iraq’s already struggling Christian community survive. Before the U.S. invasion unleashed waves of violence, Iraq had nearly 1.5 million Christians among its population of 38 million. Now only about 200,000 are left in the country, most of them in northern villages, the Kurdish region in the northeast and the capital, Baghdad.   “We’ve been marginalized by both Kurds and the central Iraqi government over the years. Now it’s Iran,” said Steve Oshana, the executive director of the nonprofit group A Demand for Action, throwing in a reference to Trump’s favorite geopolitical bogeyman. “Our land has been stolen, our rights diminished, and if we lose legitimate representation in parliament, there’s no coming back for us ... We’ve been bamboozled, and it will take leadership from the administration to make sure it doesn’t lead to our complete marginalization in our ancestral homeland.” Activists said a strong response by the U.S. government is the only way to ensure that Christians still have their interests represented and prove that Washington will not tolerate attempts to suppress them. The White House and State Department met with Iraqi Christians worried about al-Kildani at least twice last year, Oshana said.  Many in the Trump administration, particularly evangelical Christian darling Vice President Mike Pence, have said they want to help Iraq’s Christians.  “Across the wider Middle East, we can now see a future in many areas without a Christian faith. But tonight, I came to tell you, help is on the way,” Pence proclaimed in October.  But the president has repeatedly told aides he wants to wash his hands of the Middle East and avoid pulling the U.S. into its communities’ disputes. Asked to comment for this story, the White House, Pence and the State Department’s office for international religious freedom were all silent. "

BUSINESS,"I’ve written extensively about the importance of building a credit portfolio. Credit equals buying power, which, when used wisely, can lead to increased net worth. Put simply, bad credit means fewer consumer choices and a staggering number of lost opportunities in the way of deals, car-factory incentives and other credit-based transactions. No matter the purchase type, the lowest interest rates and the biggest loans go to those with the strongest credit portfolios. You can read about building your credit portfolio here. Another portfolio is the one most people neglect, if they even know it exists: the identity portfolio. Your identity portfolio is not something you can buy, trade or sell. It’s not as easy to assign a value to it. You can manage it badly and (most likely) not go bankrupt. In most situations, you won’t even lose any money — though you may not be able to get your hands on whatever was stolen by identity thieves for a while. That said, a poorly managed identity portfolio can cost you big time. First of all, the longer your money is tied up (it can take between six months to almost one year to get a stolen tax refund), the longer it will lie dormant. You can’t invest accounts that are still receivable. Second, you lose something that’s hard to quantify — your peace of mind and your ability to get through your day undistracted. In more concrete terms, while the crime committed against you is getting sorted out, your credit will take a hit. You will lose the chance to take advantage of credit-based purchases while you are resolving the fallout from identity theft. (Not sure if you’ve been the target of identity theft? You can check for signs by viewing two of your credit scores for free on Credit.com.) Here are five things you can do to improve your identity portfolio to make sure that doesn’t happen. 1. Adopt Two-Factor Authentication Increasingly, the websites you visit most — the ones that require authentication — will offer two-factor authentication. Whether the process triggers a code being sent to your phone via SMS or it fires off an email with that information, this simple security precaution makes it more difficult for a hacker to take over your accounts. The reason: They need more than the answers to your security questions or your login credentials. Two-factor authentication works because the scammer needs control of your email or access to your SMS messaging, which in most cases requires actual possession of your phone (and the security code to unlock it). 2. Make Your Login/User ID Complex Hackers and scam artists are very good at cracking the virtual safes where you keep your money, and they know how to slip past the gates protecting your social media activity. Many sites still insist on making people use their email addresses as a user ID. While it’s not as quite as risky as a Social Security number or a name/date of birth combination, your email is personally identifiable information (PII). If you are given the choice to make up a user ID, there is no reason it has to be your name. Get creative or treat it like a password (but don’t get so creative that you are tempted to share your clever inventions with friends and strangers via social media). Always assume the bad guys are watching — they are. 3. Answer Security Questions Creatively Security questions are a real problem. After decades of oversharing on social media, your mother’s maiden name, what high school you attended, the make of your first car and your favorite action movie are all up for grabs. Think you’ve been careful? What about your friends? Are you tagged? Mentioned? Even if you don’t have an account, chances are good that the people closest to you — those sharing biographical information with you — are active on social media. To avoid the possibility of a crook guessing his or her way into your life, your answers to security questions should always be lies. As above, let your spirit fly. But don’t be so creative that you can’t remember your lies. If you’re afraid of losing track, create a cheat sheet and store it on an encrypted thumb drive. 4. Store Your PII on an Encrypted Thumb Drive Losing your most essential personally identifiable information is a real drag. I recommend scanning the most crucial documents, as well as your login information if you don’t use a password manager, encrypting that information, and storing it on an air-gapped device, a category that includes the humble thumb drive. Keep one at home and store the other in a safe deposit box or a safe. This is particularly useful when you’re traveling. 5. Choose Built-in Biometric Authentication Speaking of thumb drives, for a reasonable price you can buy one that requires your fingerprint to access the information stored on it. Whether it’s a new smartphone or a gun safe, there are an increasing number of products that offer biometric security features. Remember, as I discuss at length in my book SWIPED, don’t share too much information with folks you don’t know, whether in person, on the phone or online via social media, and never authenticate yourself to anyone unless you are in control of the interaction. Bear in mind, micro-trends on social media (10 concerts I’ve been to, one is a lie; top 10 favorite movies, important books you’ve never read, etc.) are not only a fun way to get to know your friends better. They offer hackers information that can be used to answer security questions. In fact, you never know the origin of these digital stadium waves. It’s wise to assume they were started by identity thieves looking to harvest useable information. So resist the urge to answer them. It’s also critical to set long and strong passwords and properly secure all computers, smartphones and tablets used by you and your family. As mentioned, use two-factor authentication when possible and shred sensitive documents. Too much to remember? The nonprofit Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) has created a simple set of protocols called SHRED: Strengthen passwords Handle PII with care Read credit reports annually Empty your purse/wallet Discuss these tips with friends I encourage you to do all of the above and make good privacy and security hygiene a part of your daily life. Change the way you think about identity theft and your personally identifiable information. Over time, you will naturally become more vigilant. You will bear in mind what happens when people overshare on social media. You will be careful about who you tell what and why. You will not let down your guard, and before you know it, your identity portfolio will have a triple-A rating."
ENTERTAINMENT,"David Cross just can’t seem to simply say “I’m sorry.” Earlier this week, the comedian and a few of his male “Arrested Development” castmates came off sounding particularly bad during a New York Times interview about the show’s revival on Netflix. During the conversation, co-star Jessica Walter opened up about an incident in which Jeffrey Tambor — who plays her character’s husband on “Arrested Development” — was verbally abusive and yelled at her on set. Tambor was fired from another show, “Transparent,” in February after being accused of sexual harassment. “In like almost 60 years of working, I’ve never had anybody yell at me like that on a set,” Walter said through tears. In response, Cross and castmates Jason Bateman and Tony Hale came to Tambor’s defense and were dismissive of Walter’s feelings. The interview rubbed many readers the wrong way and sparked a backlash against Bateman, Cross and Hale. Bateman and Hale have since apologized to Walter. On Thursday, New York news site Gothamist asked Cross about the criticism, and the 54-year-old said he understood why people were uncomfortable with his remarks and promised to “unequivocally apologize to Jessica.” Yet just moments later, Cross couldn’t stop himself from pointing a finger in Walter’s direction. “There’s never an excuse ever for yelling at somebody and humiliating them in front of other people,” Cross told Gothamist. “And there was no excuse when Jessica did it. To Jessica’s credit, she eventually apologized to the actress and felt bad about it.” When Gothamist asked him to elaborate on Walter’s alleged outburst, Cross said there was an incident between the actress and a stand-in, “but it didn’t have the same kind of feeling that Jeffrey’s did.” Some people on Twitter did not appreciate Cross’ tone-deaf attempt to divert attention from the issue at hand. It’s a shitty deflection and misses the point entirely about what was so disturbing about the NYT exchange. This is not the first time Cross has put his foot in his mouth while attempting to apologize for his words. In October 2017, actress Charlyne Yi revealed on Twitter that he had made a racist comment to her when they first met. In response, Cross apologized to Yi but claimed she was “misremembering” the incident."
POLITICS,"The new president of the National Rifle Association, Oliver North, compared advocates of gun control to civil terrorists in an interview last week. The father of a 14-year-old girl killed in the Parkland, Florida, school shooting in February has offered a powerful rebuttal. “We’re not criminal civil terrorists,” Fred Guttenberg told Newsweek in response to North’s remarks. “We’re people with a broken heart.” “The NRA and people like Oliver North, to them, it’s a job,” Guttenberg said as he discussed the gun control debate spurred by the shooting. “They could retire and go on with their life. I can’t, because my daughter isn’t here.” Guttenberg’s daughter, Jaime, was among the 17 people killed in the February massacre. North, named the NRA’s new president last Monday, told the conservative newspaper The Washington Times that the gun group had become the victim of “civil terrorism.”  Advocates for stricter gun control had launched a “cyberwar” against the NRA, he said, and threatened the group’s members. He gave the example of a protester charged with a misdemeanor after she sprayed fake blood on the home of an NRA lobbyist. “They call them activists. That’s what they’re calling themselves. They’re not activists — this is civil terrorism. This is the kind of thing that’s never been seen against a civil rights organization in America,” North told the Times. “You go back to the terrible days of Jim Crow and those kinds of things — even there you didn’t have this kind of thing. We didn’t have the cyberwar kind of thing that we’ve got today.” North ― a retired lieutenant colonel known for his role in the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s ― added that he did not believe that the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland in which 17 people died had “fundamentally changed” the national gun debate. And he said the young survivors of the shooting, some of whom have emerged as leaders of the recent national movement against gun violence, had been “swept up by a broader propaganda machine.” “What they did very successfully with a frontal assault, and now intimidation and harassment and lawbreaking, is they confused the American people,” he said of the activists. North has been widely criticized for his comments. Stoneman Douglas students Lauren Hoggs and Cameron Kasky used Twitter posts to lambast North and the NRA.  Never knew that not wanting to die by being shot by an AR-15 in my classroom was considered terrorism. Thanks @NRA now I know. https://t.co/BdDIB2tt4a Go ahead, North. It speaks so beautifully for the NRA’s true colors that they put this crook in charge. https://t.co/JWoDyeuIO8 Guttenberg also posted on the social media platform to challenge the NRA president. “My daughter was murdered by an AR 15 … so I do not care what you think of me,” Guttenberg said in a series of messages. Oliver Noth, my daughter was murdered by an AR 15 in school and nothing changes that, and so I do not care what you think of me.https://t.co/nGIV8e55CH Throughout this process I have refused to personally attack anyone. However, your ridiculous, hateful, shameful, cruel, stupid, pathetic remark has certainly tested me. So that we are clear, the other Parkland gun crime victims and I are not civil terrorists. We are a determined group.  We will end your reign of terror and we will pass common sense gun safety in this country. Your remarks sound like the remarks of a lobby that has already lost the argument and so you attack us. We have been swept up in the determination to pass common sense gun reform. We will succeed. If that bothers you, then quit your new job or contact me to become a part of the solution.https://t.co/fyp3bBSP9h"
POLITICS,"Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani made an eyebrow-raising statement Friday, when he told CNN anchor Chris Cuomo that the president of the United States can be found guilty of obstructing justice.  Asked explicitly whether any president can obstruct justice, Giuliani replied: “He can.” The statement reverses a claim made by John Dowd, a now-former lawyer for President Donald Trump, who told Axios in December that the president cannot obstruct justice.  “[H]e is the chief law enforcement officer under [the Constitution’s Article II] and has every right to express his view of any case,” Dowd told the outlet at the time.  Giuliani joined Trump’s legal team about one month after Dowd announced his resignation in late March. Legal experts have debated the merits of Dowd’s argument. Many disagree with it ― including Giuliani, at least for the moment.  The debate is increasingly relevant as Trump’s team seems to be taking an increasingly confrontational approach to special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe that may include positing that the president simply cannot be charged with any of the crimes being investigated. Mueller is reportedly zeroing in on a few key issues, including possible obstruction. Mueller’s appointment was triggered by Trump’s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey on May 9, 2017, Giuliani told Cuomo on Friday. The former mayor also said, “The president has complete discretion to fire anybody he wants.” But he stressed that there was “zero evidence” to justify the investigation in the first place. In an interview on May 11, 2017, Trump conceded he had considered the “Russia thing” when he decided to fire Comey, prompting questions over whether obstruction charges could apply.

BUSINESS,"Apple has apologized for covertly slowing down the performance of iPhones with older batteries ― and, as a peace offering, it’s temporarily dropping the price of its replacement batteries. Starting late January until December 2018, battery replacements will be $29 ― down from the original price of $79 ― for users with an iPhone 6 or later version. “We know that some of you feel Apple has let you down. We apologize,” the company wrote in a statement published on Thursday. “First and foremost, we have never ― and would never ― do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades,” the statement read. Apple also insisted that it designs iPhones to “last as long as possible.”  Still, some consumers thought the discount was insufficient.  Discount? I would like a free battery. They can afford it. https://t.co/ekNq1Hr74F Others defended Apple and argued that the company was only trying to help iPhones function more efficiently.  Earlier this week, Apple confirmed that it was deliberately slowing down older iPhone devices via a software upgrade as the batteries aged. Although the company insisted that it was slowing down the phones to protect their batteries from spontaneously shutting down, many accused the company of implementing the slowdown to force consumers to purchase new batteries or iPhones. The news prompted at least two lawsuits against the tech giant. Apple’s statement on Thursday provided information about the apparent eventual degradation of rechargeable batteries. It also released a new customer support article expanding on batteries and performance. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said the price drop affected iPhone 6 models and older. It is the iPhone 6 and later versions."
POLITICS,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) sees a lot to like in the wave of teacher strikes, from West Virginia to Kentucky to Oklahoma to Arizona. But what pleases him most is that the revolt is being driven from the bottom up, as teachers start their own grassroots movements and the unions follow their lead. “If you’re noticing what’s going on, the teachers are ahead of their union officials. I’m very impressed by that,” Sanders told HuffPost. “To my mind, this is the tip of the iceberg, with workers standing up.” Sanders said the teacher walkouts are evidence that more workers would like to band together in unions if only the law made it easier. To that end, the senator led a group of Democrats in unveiling a bill Wednesday that would dramatically reform labor law and boost the dwindling ranks of unions in the private sector, where just 6.5 percent of workers are members today. “The facts are very clear that workers in unions earn significantly higher wages than non-union workers,” Sanders said. “The reason we have seen such an assault not only on existing unions but against the rights of workers to join unions is employers know that. If they can prevent workers from becoming organized, they can pay insufficient wages.” Sanders’ bill, called the Workplace Democracy Act, would remove several of the major barriers to organized labor’s growth. It would ban “right to work” laws, which allow employees to opt out of paying union dues even though the union must still bargain on their behalf, leading to what unions call “free-riding.” In recent years, Republicans and business groups have pushed to expand the reach of right-to-work laws, which are now on the books in 28 states, including traditional labor strongholds like Michigan and Wisconsin. The bill would also guarantee workers the right to form a union after a majority in their workplace have signed cards saying that is their wish. “Card check,” as the process is known, lets organizers bypass the holding of a secret-ballot election, before which employers often pressure workers to vote no. Democrats pursued card check legislation in 2009 with the Employee Free Choice Act, but they failed to pass a bill before Republicans took back the House in the 2010 midterm elections. Unions and their allies in Congress still rue the missed opportunity. “I think it would have made a huge difference” if the Employee Free Choice Act had passed, Sanders said. Among its other provisions, Sanders’ current bill would make it easier for unions to seek mediation when they can’t reach a first contract with an employer in a reasonable period of time. Negotiations over a first contract can be an effective stall tactic for businesses, sometimes dragging on for years. The bill would also legalize secondary boycotts, allowing unions to target an employer’s clients as a way to pressure the employer. Secondary boycotts were outlawed in 1947 under the Taft-Hartley Act, the same law that paved the way for right-to-work statutes. With Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House, Sanders’ legislation has no real chance of becoming law anytime soon. But it could be another indicator that high-profile Democrats plan to make rejuvenating the labor movement a priority, particularly as progressive activists have been pushing the agenda to the left since the 2016 elections. The Democrats who’ve signed on as co-sponsors of the Workplace Democracy Act include Sens. Tammy Baldwin (Wis.), Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.). Part of the bill has already made it into the Democrats’ “Better Deal” platform, which calls for an end to right-to-work laws and was unveiled by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) late last year. The popularity of labor unions has increased markedly since the Great Recession. A 61 percent approval rating in 2017 is the highest that Gallup has seen since 2003. Yet public policy appears to be moving in the other direction, as GOP-led states peel back collective bargaining rights and the Supreme Court considers making the entire public sector a right-to-work zone. Sanders argues that the weakened state of unionism in the U.S. doesn’t just threaten workers’ wages and benefits ― it undermines the progressive social programs that unions fight for. “You could make the argument that right now the trade union movement, as weak as it is, is the last line of defense against a corporate agenda that not only wants tax breaks for billionaires but wants to privatize Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid,” Sanders said. “If they can break the trade union movement or make it without any power,” he asked, “who is going to stop that agenda?”"

ARTS & CULTURE,"""You get to decide what has meaning and what doesn't,"" David Foster Wallace wrote in a rare moment of candor. Though the advice might seem out of place in one of his winding, playfully cerebral novels, it fit right in as the thrust of his commencement speech at Kenyon College, which was later adapted into a short, beloved book, This Is Water.  Though end-of-the-year well-wishes can easily recede into clichés, writers tend to offer eloquent, less-hackneyed advice for new graduates. Take, for instance, Ursula K. Le Guin's ballsy rejection of giving advice that promotes success through dominance: ""Instead of talking about power,"" she said, ""what if I talked like a woman right here in public?"" A new book out this year pays homage to these salient bits of wisdom, packaging them prettily with fun fonts.

POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― If Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is a closet liberal bent on taking down a Republican president, he’s been playing a long game. A few days before the presidential election of 1984, the future deputy attorney general was upset over an editorial in The Daily Pennsylvanian that expressed dismay that then-President Ronald Reagan was polling better at Penn than the nation’s other premier universities. Rosenstein, in a letter to the editor, called the piece “disgraceful” and wrote that it was “illogical and immoral” to suggest the poll results reflected poorly on the university. “Perhaps if you took a step back from the Ivy Tower in which you and perhaps students at the more ‘elite’ schools appear to be, you would recognize and respect the appeal Reagan has to the average American,” Rosenstein wrote. “I am proud to know that the opinions of students at our University are most representative of the nation as a whole.” Rosenstein ― the man President Donald Trump nominated to become the No. 2 official at the Justice Department ― is a Republican. He’s been honored by Harvard Law School’s Federalist Society. As a member of Kenneth Starr’s Whitewater team, he investigated the Clintons (and even sat in on an interview with Hillary Clinton). Former President George W. Bush tried to make him a federal appeals court judge. But that’d be tough to know if you watched Fox News most nights, or scrolled through the president’s Twitter feed. A group of Republicans in the House of Representatives have even drafted articles of impeachment against Rosenstein. Trump, who previously implied Rosenstein was a Democrat, tweeted Wednesday that he might “have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!” ― implying that he could fire Rosenstein and perhaps shut down the special counsel investigation he oversees that has already taken down a number of Trump associates. For those who have known Rosenstein well, the notion that the longtime Republican law enforcement official is a closet liberal bent on taking down the president is tough to digest. “He’s not some sneaky Democrat,” says Megan Brown, a former official in the Justice Department during the George W. Bush administration who worked closely with Rosenstein. “We’re in sort of a silly season on this, but he’s not some sort of Democrat in Republican’s clothes with some agenda.” The president’s favorite cable news channel’s continuous attacks on Rosenstein ― including the suggestion that Rosenstein committed crimes and should be jailed ― have made things pretty awkward for DOJ’s second-in-command. Until this week, his public comments were pretty much limited to making jokes about how much he hates D.C. or how he thought being deputy attorney general would be a relatively low-profile gig. That changed after a group of House Republicans drafted potential articles of impeachment against Rosenstein. At an event on Tuesday, he suggested it was cowardly for the lawmakers not to put their names on a document they leaked, and said it illustrated the differences between how politicians and the Justice Department operate. “I can tell you that there are people who have been making threats privately and publicly against me for quite some time, and I think they should understand by now that the Department of Justice is not going to be extorted,” Rosenstein said. “We’re going to do what’s required by the rule of law, and any kind of threats that anybody makes are not going to affect the way we do our job. We have a responsibility. We take an oath.” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on @freedomcaucus members considering his impeachment: ""They can't even resist leaking their own drafts."" He also says, ""The Department of Justice is not going to be extorted.”Question from @lauraajarrett. pic.twitter.com/puEnP3thgA Rosenstein said that disputes with Congress over Justice Department documents ― the ostensible reason some Republicans are targeting Rosenstein ― needed to be worked out on a “case-by-case” basis. Republicans have requested sensitive documents, and DOJ said it would not provide one that laid out the scope of Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation. “Everybody always thinks that the current moment is an unprecedented moment, but it really isn’t. These incidents do flare up from time to time, and ultimately, they’re resolved,” Rosenstein said.  “If we were to just open our doors to allow Congress to come and rummage through the files, that would be a serious infringement on the separation of powers,” he added. Although Rosenstein’s also come under direct criticism from Trump, he has had nothing but positive things to say about the Trump administration’s agenda. On Tuesday, he said that Trump had appointed a leadership team at the Department of Justice that “respects the rule of law” and praised him for signing a staff-written Law Day proclamation that noted the importance of the separation of powers and the rule of law. By Wednesday morning, Trump was promoting a book by Fox News commentator Gregg Jarrett, who has called the FBI “America’s secret police” and the special counsel “illegitimate and corrupt.” Trump praised Jarrett ― who has also made repeated assertions that Rosenstein violated the law and threatened members of Congress ― as “brilliant.” The president also declared Jarrett’s forthcoming book, titled The Russia Hoax - The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump, a “MUST READ.”  Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

POLITICS,"President Donald Trump on Thursday tried to explain Rudy Giuliani’s startling claim that Trump reimbursed personal lawyer Michael Cohen for a $130,000 settlement to silence adult film star Stormy Daniels, who alleges she had an affair with the president.  Trump said in a tweet that Cohen was paid a monthly retainer “not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract ... known as a non-disclosure agreement.” He added that the agreement was to “stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair.” The president’s tweets appeared to ratify a central claim of Giuliani’s startling statements Wednesday night on Fox News.  Mr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA. These agreements are..... ...very common among celebrities and people of wealth. In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms. Clifford (Daniels). The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair,...... ...despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair. Prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement. Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction. “It’s going to turn out to be perfectly legal; that money was not campaign money,” Giuliani, who joined Trump’s legal team last month to handle issues related to special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, told Fox News’ Sean Hannity Wednesday night in an attempt to argue that the payment wasn’t a campaign finance violation. The payment was “funneled through a law firm, and then the president repaid it.” “Sorry, I’m giving you a fact now that you don’t know,” Giuliani told Hannity.  He said the president was unaware of the “specifics” of the payments, “but he did know about the general arrangement that Michael would take care of things like this.” Giuliani told The New York Times after his appearance on Hannity’s show that a monthly $35,000 reimbursement scheme was set up, coming out of a personal Trump family account. Trump ended up paying Cohen $460,000 to $470,000 in total, including funds for “incidental expenses,” he said. Thursday morning, on “Fox & Friends,” Giuliani seemed to backpedal on his statement that Trump knew about the payments to Cohen. “He didn’t know the details of this until we knew the details of it, which is a couple weeks ago ― maybe not even a couple weeks, maybe 10 days ago,” Giuliani said of Trump. “Remember when this came up ― October 2016 ... I don’t want to demean anyone, but $135,000 seems like a lot of money. It’s not when you’re putting $100 million into your campaign. It isn’t pocket change, but it’s pretty close to it.” Giuliani also came to the defense of Cohen, who Trump has held at arm’s length since FBI raids last month seized records from the lawyer.   “I think he was trying to help the family,” Giuliani said of Cohen. “And for that, the man is being treated like some kind of villain. And I think he was just being a good lawyer and a good man.” #RudyGiuliani: ""The President had been hurt personally - not politically, personally, so much, and @FLOTUS, by some of the false allegations, that one more false allegation, 6 years old, I think, he was trying to help the family."" pic.twitter.com/xZzE1MVct7 Giuliani told the Times that he had discussed what he planned to say on Fox News Wednesday night with Trump before and after the interview. His interview contradicted the statements of Trump and Cohen. Cohen said in March that he’d paid Daniels out of his own pocket. Trump said he had no knowledge that Cohen had paid Daniels, when asked last month aboard Air Force One.  “You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen,” he said when reporters pressed him. “Michael is my attorney. You’ll have to ask Michael.”  WATCH: President Trump says he did not know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels while speaking to reporters on Air Force One pic.twitter.com/IPQ786tWRa Michael Avenatti, Daniels’ attorney, called Giuliani’s admission a “bombshell” that will undoubtedly bring the president down. Trump, he said in an interview with CNN, could face “potential criminal liability” related to money laundering, campaign finance and fraud violations.  “I said it weeks ago, I’m going to say it again: Mr. Trump will not serve out his term,” Avenatti said. This article has been updated to include Giuliani’s comments Thursday on “Fox & Friends.”"
ENTERTAINMENT,"“I still go to Taco Bell / drive through, raw as Hell / I don’t care, I’m still real,” Fergie, perhaps the most overlooked lyricist of our time, sings in her song “Glamorous.”  Well, we should have believed her then, because the former Black Eyed Peas singer pretty much flew the opposite of first class when she rode the New York City subway on Tuesday night.  For most people, a subway commute is spent mindlessly staring at a phone. But for Fergie, it was an Instagram-worthy adventure. She hilariously documented her descent surrounded, of course, by a team of bodyguards, as she made her way to the Paley Honors gala. A post shared by Fergie (@fergie) on May 15, 2018 at 9:10pm PDT A post shared by Sara (@sara_smile38) on May 15, 2018 at 4:05pm PDT An Armageddon-like thunderstorm sent New Yorkers scrambling underground to escape the weather (and the insane traffic). As a woman of the people, Fergie did the same, except she was clad in an all-white suit. “So we’re taking the subway because a tropical storm hit New York,” she explained on social media. “And then we had to get from Columbus Circle to Cipriani Wall Street in a full white suit, check it out, August Getty. And uh, yeah, through the rain! And we’re gonna go to the Paley Honors, and I’m the first presenter, so here we go!” Commuters slowly began to catch on that the Duchess herself was riding along with them, prompting one to play her song “Glamorous” on a phone. Fergie, predictably, started singing along.  Unlike pretty much everybody else in the city, she did make it to her destination on time, posing for pictures on the red carpet later in the evening. Flossy, flossy!"
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON – Donald Trump’s longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen was paid millions of dollars in consulting fees by corporate clients, but never discussed those clients with the president, Trump’s new lawyer said Friday. “The president had no knowledge of it,” Rudy Giuliani told HuffPost in an interview. Cohen received $600,000 from AT&T, $1.2 million from Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis and $500,000 from an investment bank affiliated with a Russian oligarch, all following Trump’s unexpected election win in 2016. Giuliani said Cohen’s business relationships did not contradict Trump’s campaign promises to end “pay-to-play” schemes and to “drain the swamp” because Cohen did not get for his newfound clients what they wanted. “Whatever lobbying was done didn’t reach the president,” Giuliani said, offering as proof the fact that AT&T’s proposed merger with Time-Warner has not gone through. “He did drain the swamp ... The president denied the merger. They didn’t get the result they wanted.” AT&T forced out the head of its Washington office Friday, while its CEO issued a statement acknowledging that hiring Cohen – who was long known as Trump’s “fixer” in New York – was “a big mistake.” Novartis had earlier said that it realized Cohen could not offer any real expertise on health care, but that it felt obligated to continue paying his $100,000 a month fee under the contract they had signed until it expired earlier this year. The FBI raided Cohen’s office last month and federal prosecutors in New York are investigating him. Both AT&T and Novartis said that special counsel Robert Mueller’s office contacted them last year. Mueller was appointed to continue an investigation into Russian intelligence agencies’ work to help Trump win the 2016 election after Trump fired FBI director James Comey, who had been leading the probe. Trump later told NBC News and top Russian diplomats visiting the Oval Office that firing Comey was related to the Russia investigation. Giuliani, the former U.S. Attorney of the office now investigating Cohen and also a former New York City mayor, took charge of Trump’s private legal team handling the Mueller investigation last month with the hope of wrapping it up quickly. He said Friday he doubts that Trump would have time to speak to Mueller before the newly announced summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12. although it’s possible he and Trump could decide by then whether the president would, in fact, sit down to speak with Mueller at all. Giuliani said he based his previous estimate of a quick ending on the belief that Mueller was essentially done with his investigation. “There’s no point in being interviewed if they’re not near the end,” he said. He said the fact that Cohen has become involved in the probe shows that Mueller has been unable to make headway on the idea of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. He blamed much of Cohen’s involvement on adult film actress Stormy Daniels and her new lawyer, Michael Avenatti. They have been trying to break a non-disclosure agreement she signed promising not to discuss an affair she said she had with Trump a decade ago in return for $130,000. “I think she feels she was cheated. She thinks she could have gotten more,” Giuliani said. Cohen drew up the agreement, complete with fake names for Trump and Daniels, and paid the money using a shell company he registered in Delaware just days earlier. Cohen started using that same shell company a few weeks later to start receiving payments from his corporate clients. Giuliani said he represents Trump, not Cohen, but nevertheless believes Cohen did nothing wrong. “They’re buying his advice. It can turn out to be good or bad,” he said. “There’s a lot of people in Washington who are paid for their advice.” He added that Cohen does not deserve what is happening to him. “The guy is under severe emotional pressure. The guy is really collateral damage,” Giuliani said. Cohen did not respond to a HuffPost query. He has not been charged in the investigation."
ARTS & CULTURE,"As you turned the last page of George Orwell’s 1984, were you overwhelmed by a surge of fatalistic angst? The hero (uh, spoiler alert) has lost his quest to overthrow the totalitarian regime against which he had rebelled, and that seems to be that: No hope, no change.  Well, maybe we’ve been looking at that all wrong, Handmaid’s Tale author and speculative fiction doyenne Margaret Atwood recently told the CBC. “1984 has a coda, and the coda is a note on Newspeak, which was the language being developed to eliminate thought, making it impossible to actually think,” she points out. “The note on Newspeak at the end of 1984 is written in standard English in the past tense, which tells us that Newspeak did not persist.”  So, perhaps the tale of Oceania ends more hopefully than you thought, with the downfall of Big Brother rather than a “decisive victory”? In her own dystopian classic, Atwood revealed the fall of the authoritarian Republic of Gilead not through her heroine, Offred, winding up triumphant, but through a similar epilogue that frames Offred’s first-person account as an artifact from a failed regime ― an object of study to scholars in the more liberal society that has replaced it. Atwood has previously described the concluding 1984 essay on Newspeak as a direct influence on her own choice to end The Handmaid’s Tale with an academic epilogue, though the essay is typically read as an appendix rather than as the conclusion to the novel. “The essay on Newspeak is written in standard English, in the third person, and in the past tense, which can only mean that the regime has fallen, and that language and individuality have survived,” she wrote in The Guardian in 2003. “For whoever has written the essay on Newspeak, the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four is over. Thus, it’s my view that Orwell had much more faith in the resilience of the human spirit than he’s usually been given credit for.” From a rather practical standpoint, Atwood explained to CBC, “Doom and gloom all the way through is not motivating to people. If we’re all going to go swirling down the plug hole, why make any effort, why not just stay in bed all day or party?” By revealing that freedom and justice will eventually triumph, the dystopian author offers us motivation to fight. The reassurance that totalitarianism is unsustainable may reassure some in the current political climate ― though it’s worth remembering the often lengthy time-frame, and the casualties. In Y.A. dystopian sagas, readers can follow along as the protagonists singlehandedly dismantle a crushing regime (Harry Potter, The Hunger Games) or at least nobly die while putting the final cracks in it, all by the age of 18. After the 2016 election, many liberals took solace in comparing opposition to Donald Trump to Harry Potter’s fight against Lord Voldemort, a dramatic yet pacifying narrative in which an oppressive government is overthrown by a single hero. More realistically, books like 1984 and Handmaid’s Tale focus on the midst of the struggle, on resistance fighters who fail and are forgotten. Offred and 1984’s Winston Smith may see the promised land, but they won’t enter into it. That may not seem like cause for optimism, but it seems in dystopia, optimism is all a question of perspective."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Sarah Paulson found it a little distracting to work, work, work, work, work, work with Rihanna while filming their upcoming movie, “Ocean’s 8.” “It was sort of a daily struggle not to embarrass myself because every time I looked at her, I was like, ‘Work, work, work, work, work, work,’” the Emmy-winning actress told Ellen DeGeneres while doing a little shimmy on Monday. “It’s just deeply nerdy, and [Sandra Bullock] would just constantly look at me like, ‘Hey, dial it down. Just stop.’ And I’d be like, ‘What? I gotta just do it.’” Paulson even began pitching songs she’d make up on the fly to Rihanna, which the singer apparently had no time for. “She’d be like, ‘No … I really need you to stop singing,’” Paulson, 43, told DeGeneres. “She thought my lyrics weren’t so bad but my melody was terrible. And she gives great side-eye, so the minute she does it, you’re like, ‘I’m really sorry.’” When DeGeneres asked Paulson if the two eventually became friends despite her geeky tendencies, she replied, “I like to think I did … I think we’re friends,” adding that they text sometimes. Paulson said the two recently “had fun” watching Madonna perform at the Met Gala together. “So y’all are pals?” DeGeneres asked. “Yeah, we’re best friends,” Paulson said sarcastically before mouthing “no” to the audience. Well, we know how Rihanna would react to this whole exchange."

ARTS & CULTURE," The perfect beach read is in the eye of the beholder. For some, getting lost in a faraway fantasy world or suspenseful thriller appeals, and reduces the risk of dozing off, book firmly planted on face. For others, fantasy can be found closer to home, in whirlwind romances and compelling character studies. Whatever your preference, we recommend packing one of the following fun reads to dive into during your summer outings.
Naked at Lunch by Mark Haskell Smith
For many of us, being at a beach in the summer can feel weirdly like hanging out with a bunch of strangers in our underwear. (Right?) Haskell Smith’s rollicking Naked at Lunch does its absolute best to make us feel more comfortable in our skin. In his funny, thorough account of his investigative stint as a social nudist, he deftly balances reporting, dry humor, historical context and hilarious anecdotes. He overhears swingers having a casual orgy in Cap d’Agde, a bustling French nudist resort; he goes for a vigorous hike with a whole troop of naked people in the European Alps; he sees a man with a penis pump waving his erect member while frolicking at a nude beach in California. You may not be a total convert -- I sure wasn’t -- but Haskell Smith’s enthusiasm is infectious and his subject matter will make you appreciate the cool breeze on your mostly unclothed beach body more than ever. -Claire Fallon
The Diver’s Clothes Lie Empty by Vendela Vida
Vida’s narrator wanders the streets of Morocco in a series of increasingly absurd events. She’s lost her non-descript black backpack upon landing, and on her hunt to reclaim it, winds up backstage at a Patti Smith show, on set for a movie being filmed at her hotel, and telling flat-out lies to American embassy attendants. A funny, thoughtful commentary on the precariousness of identity. -Maddie Crum

Modern Romance by Aziz Ansari
This pop science book, which Ansari collaborated on with sociologist Eric Klinenberg, doesn’t promise the nonstop laughs of most big releases by standup comics. It does, however, offer a comprehensive dive into the dynamics of dating today, dissecting the relative merits of different texting approaches and the pitfalls of creating an online dating profile. The sober science may take the reins here, but Ansari manages to keep a subdued through-line of irreverent humor, illustrating points with ridiculous hypothetical scenarios and recounting particularly awkward text exchanges shared by audience members. For the dating-minded modern single, or anyone intrigued by the vagaries of relationships today, Modern Romance is the ideal beach read, breezy and easy-reading yet still substantive. -Claire
Find Me by Laura van den Berg
A more personal, contemplative take on doomsday plotlines, Find Me follows Joy on her escapades in a wayward hospital for survivors of a strange epidemic. Beginning with a silvery rash, the disease culminates in memory loss and death, but Joy, who’s endured a traumatic childhood that’s transported her from foster home to foster home, seems somehow immune. Sometime during the chaos of the apocalypse-torn country, she learns the identity of her birth mother, and sets out to find her. -Maddie

The Star Side of Bird Hill by Naomi Jackson
Jackson’s debut takes on heavy topics -- depression, grief, abandonment -- but with a backbone of hope that keeps the narrative aloft. Teenage Dionne and 10-year-old Phaedra have been sent to Barbados for the summer when their mother, Avril, no longer feels she can care for them in Brooklyn. With their grandmother, Hyacinth, the girls struggle to digest the sudden change in their lives and to find identities for themselves in Bird Hill, even to think of it as home. The characters, especially Phaedra, feel solid and alive, riddled with the flaws and idiosyncrasies no human is without. In simple, straightforward prose, Jackson maps the girls’ emotional developments as they learn to make sense of their family and their futures -- and a home where winter never comes. -Claire
Mayumi and the Sea of Happiness by Jennifer Tseng
Jennifer Tseng's novel comes from Europa -- the publisher of Elena Ferrante's acclaimed series -- and similarly employs Realism to reveal the wonders of everyday desires and the stifling strictures of a society's norms. A 40-something librarian whiles away her time, enjoying her days surrounded by books, until her infatuation with a younger patron invades her thoughts. While the plot is reminiscent of Doris Lessing's The Grandmothers, Tseng dives deeper into her narrator's thoughts and motivations. -Maddie
The Enlightenment of Nina Findlay by Andrea Gillies
Nina, driven to Greece by the collapse of her marriage and her best friendship, soon finds herself in a hospital bed recovering after being struck by a bus. There, in a sun-washed Grecian clinic, she has time to repeatedly rehash her mistakes, the path that led her to such an unsatisfying life. Best friends with Luca, a neighbor, as a girl, she ultimately married his brother instead, maintaining a decades-long friendship -- and flirtation -- with Luca, until shocking events wrecked both relationships. Nina is distracted from her meditations, however, by the handsome doctor at the clinic, who quickly takes an interest in his new patient; as he urges her to confide more and more in him, she sees that he offers another possible life. Gillies’ quiet rumination on midlife crises and self-knowledge, set in the midst of a balmy idyll, makes a perfect holiday read for the introspective reader. -Claire

The Life and Death of Sophie Stark by Anna North
North tells the story of a single, eccentric artist, Sophie Stark, through the intertwined lives of those close to her. Daniel, a fallen former athlete, met Sophie in college when he was the subject of her first film; Allison was “discovered” by Sophie while performing an embellished nonfiction story at a reading event. Through those she’s loved, we learn of Sophie’s difficulties with intimacy; she prefers life behind the lens to the messy, structureless real world. Film lovers or readers craving a compelling character study will relish going behind the scenes with Stark. -Maddie

Pretty Is by Maggie Mitchell
If you prefer to add a dark edge to your sunny vacation, this debut work of literary suspense should keep you on the edge of your beach chair. The plot hinges on the abduction of two little girls, a spelling bee champ and a beauty queen, by a man who keeps them in a remote cabin for two months. Years later, the two have moved past their childhood trauma, but when one, now an actress, receives a script for a movie shockingly similar to her own experience, the abduction’s consequences can’t stay buried in the past. -Claire
Saint Mazie by Jami Attenberg
Like North’s novel, Attenberg’s is structured as a fictional oral history of a single, remarkable woman. Mazie Phillips is a Prohibition-era partygoer who, when the Depression hits, eagerly takes on a new identity as a movie theater owner serving patrons in need. Mazie’s true story was shared in The New Yorker, but Attenberg imbues it with her lively voice and wit, penning Mazie’s diary and reflections on her vivacity from those who knew her. -Maddie
Hausfrau by Jill Alexander Essbaum
If you haven’t yet picked up this taut domestic drama, summer vacation isn’t a bad time. Desperate housewife Anna Benz, is an American woman who moved to Switzerland with her Swiss banker husband. With two young children, but no real friends or distractions, Anna turns to the comfort of illicit flings -- initially carefully controlled, but eventually deeply consuming and even self-destructive. Essbaum, a poet, infuses the book with finely crafted, playful prose, but it’s the suspenseful narrative that will keep you turning the pages. -Claire

The Rocks by Peter Nichols
Nichols’ novel might be the most literal beach read selection, which isn’t to say the story won’t transport you. A sailing enthusiast, he sets his story in stunning, sleep Mallorca, where the lives of two couples -- one set of honeymooners driven apart by a mysterious incident, and their star-crossed children, who find love on the same island decades later -- slowly collide. The Rocks is a sensual treasure, a love story and a subtle examination of the tides of time. -Maddie
Local Girls by Caroline Zancan
You’re at your favorite beach-town bar, and your celebrity crush walks in. What next? Zancan puts an intense, psychological spin on this dream scenario in Local Girls. The girls, three close friends from near Orlando, spot their favorite movie star in their local watering hole, and unexpectedly, he strikes up a conversation with them. The result: Long-suppressed grievances between the friends bubble to the surface, upending their solid, lifelong friendship. Zancan infuses her narrative with both carefree fun and deeply felt human emotions familiar to any reader who’s experience a complicated friendship. -Claire
Seveneves by Neal Stephenson
Stephenson’s novel isn’t the dreamy, lackadaisical sort of book you’d hope to curl up with on the sand, but if you’re hunting for an enthralling saga -- something to keep you alert while you laze -- Seveneves is a strong, explosive contender. It spans millennia -- from the near-end of the world to surviving humans’ apprehensive return 5,000 years later. It’s not a “hard science” read a la The Martian -- instead, Stephenson weaves in politics and philosophy, as he explores the tension between the reassembled nations that cropped up post-apocalypse. -Maddie
Let Me Explain You by Annie Liontas
Let’s say you need a few laughs on your vacation -- isn’t that what vacations are all about? Liontas’ energetic saga infuses a poignant family drama with raucous humor and outsize characters. When Stavros Stavros Mavrakis, believing he has only 10 days to live, sends his family a harsh email berating them for how they’re each failing at life, they laugh it off. Soon after, however, he disappears, and his ex-wife and three daughters begin to wonder if he is actually dying. Let Me Explain You has both heart and hilarity, the perfect combination for a poolside read. -Claire "
ARTS & CULTURE," The clichéd rivalry between the East and West Coasts of the United States confounds those of us who grew up in distant lands. When it comes to ballet, in particular, many American balletomanes appear oblivious to the bustle outside the precincts of New York City.  On the subject of The Nutcracker, for example, many subscribe to the myth that George Balanchine's 1954 reinvention of the Russian classic for New York City Ballet ""sparked an American holiday tradition"" -- in the words of Laura Jacobs, who penned a fascinating exploration of Balanchine's Nutcracker for Vanity Fair, even as she played fast and loose with the essential detail of the ballet's arrival on American shores.   Other scholars - like Jennifer Fisher, who wrote a sociological meditation on the industry that now props up most American ballet companies (Nutcracker Nation) - identify Willam Christensen's 1944 production for San Francisco Ballet as the first full-length American production, whose enormous popularity astonished even its creator. And now a captivating children's book arrives to set the record straight for the younger generation.  In The Nutcracker Comes to America, author Chris Barton introduces us to the remarkable Christensen brothers, Willam, Harold and Lew, whose ""dance-loving, violin-playing grandfather"" emigrated from Denmark and settled in Utah. We follow the young men's zigzagging journeys from the ballet studio to vaudeville stages across the country, to New York to dance for the greats like Balanchine and Fokine, and into the army, against the backdrop of World War II.  Lew, the most naturally gifted of the three, became the first homegrown American danseur noble, and a choreographer of some repute. For Lincoln Kirstein's Ballet Caravan, he created Filling Station, a comic slice of Americana set in a gas station populated with ""truckers, a gangster, a state trooper, and a little girl who really needed to use the restroom.""  The restless Christensens couldn't seem to stay put. Which turned out to be providential for American ballet, especially on the West Coast. Willam brought ballet to Portland, Oregon, and later established the formidable Salt Lake City company that would be known as Ballet West. In between, there was San Francisco, where he and Harold spun off the ballet troupe from the opera company, while Lew ""traded in his ballet shoes for army boots.""  It was during wartime America, when many dancers were off fighting and money was especially scarce, that Willam needed a big hit ""to keep ballet alive in San Francisco."" He loved the great Russian classics and though he'd never seen them performed - at least not in their entirety - he would research them painstakingly. As part of his research for The Nutcracker, he cornered Balanchine and Alexandra Danilova and had them recount for him as much of the detail of the Petipa production as they could recall from their own experience dancing in it. The Christensens' peregrinations, and the delightful goings-on onstage and backstage during the first Nutcracker, are illuminated in the arresting illustrations by Cathy Gendron - multiple coatings of thin oil glaze meticulously layered over pencil drawings on gesso, then lightly textured, as if burnished by steel wool. The colors glow softly on the page, and the whimsical yet realistic figures convey energy and emotion that will intrigue adults as much as children.  Ballet to the People's favorite drawing is of Lew Christensen on a New York City sidewalk, still in his army uniform, having just returned from wartime service. He is looking wistfully through the windows of a ballet studio while class is in session. The narrative reads: ""[Y]ears in the army had done a number on his body. He couldn't dance like he'd danced before."" Lew would eventually bring the Balanchine technique and style to San Francisco Ballet in the early 1950's, when he took over the company reins after Willam moved to Salt Lake City.  Don't be misled by the book title. This is much more than the story of the transplanting of a famous Russian ballet. And not just a book for little girls who dream of dancing in tutus and pink satin pointe shoes.  This is a real-life adventure story about ""a trio of small-town Utah boys"" with grit and talent, who bucked stereotypes, endured failures and persevered, and who individually and together enriched the cultural life of America.  For older readers and adults (and dance writers keen to fill in the gaps in their historical knowledge), Barton provides a more detailed timeline at the end of the book, including some marvelous vintage photos.  Throughout the children's tale and the more grown-up addendum, a light wit prevails, and there is much to read between the lines. About the 1892 premiere of The Nutcracker at the Mariinsky Theatre, Barton comments laconically, ""It does not catch on."" And those who are familiar with the hard business of ballet know that it was the Christensens' sheer determination that kept San Francisco Ballet afloat for decades.   English critic Richard Buckle famously groused that every Christmas brings us ""one more Nutcracker closer to death.""  Yet across America, spurred by the early Christensen and Balanchine productions, and by the popularity of the brilliantly animated 'Nutcracker Suite' in Disney's Fantasia, the ballet has become a hallowed ritual -- not just for audiences, but for the legions of young performers who grow up through the ranks of mice, soldiers, Mother Ginger's children, candy canes, snowflakes, waltzing flowers, and Russian acrobats, their eyes on the prize: the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier.  So many of those young dancers in training are unaware of the colorful history behind this tradition. Barton and Gendron's new book does its bit to fill that gap, with charm and wisdom."
ARTS & CULTURE," Writer Alex Edelman is a millennial, but he doesn't like the label much, nor does he enjoy the way Generation Y is characterized in the media -- entitled, saccharine, out-of-touch.  ""I think that it’s pretty condescending that young people are kind of spoken to in a jargon-y way like we aren’t clever enough to see through it,"" he told The Huffington Post. He'll discuss these stereotypes, and his own personal experiences, in a performance tonight at SubCulture in New York City.  Though he's got a few choice words for those making generalizations about his generation, he's outspoken about millennials' shortcomings, too; he recently wrote unabashedly for The Guardian about Gen Y-ers' disproportionate belief in the harm of vaccinations. So, although his background is in stand-up comedy -- he won the Fosters Edinburgh Comedy Award for Best Newcomer last year -- he's not afraid to earnestly tackle weighty subjects.  Edelman spoke about corporate jargon, surrealism in comedy, and, yes, millennials: Your performance is called “Millennial,” and you’re technically a millennial, too. The term is increasingly nebulous -- what does “millennial” mean to you?
“Millennial” is a garbage phrase. That said, it’s an incredibly important one. It’s garbage because it’s been used to sum up an entire generation of people. The largest and most diverse generation of people. Unique people with a unique set of problems. So that’s the garbage. When people think of a millennial, they think of an entitled young person living off their parents, which is kind of infuriating.

But it is a useful and crucial phrase sometimes, because we are, as a generation, of a certain mindset because of the interesting time we’ve been raised in and it’s worth using a phrase to discuss that. So I guess millennial is good as any.

What urged you to write about the shared experiences of this almost too-discussed generation?
Well, I’m part of this generation. I don’t think we’re too discussed. I think we just aren’t discussed empathetically or intelligently. I see a lot of that in print, though: journalists saying that there is too much talk about Gen Y-ers. To me, that’s like saying “women are too discussed as a gender” or “there are too many thought pieces about race.” With all that said, the show is, at its core, an hour of stand-up comedy. Anecdotes and jokes about different things. It’s a very personal show and obviously the view of my generation is through a very personalized lens.

How does writing “stand-up” and a “show” compare?
Hm. I think the challenge of writing a show is that an audience will want something more than just jokes. They’ll want to understand that there’s a hinterland behind what you’re saying and that what you’re saying means something to you personally.

For me, the structure of the show -- which is around a test I took -- provided a really useful framework for the material, but it was very different from just doing a 20-minute club set.

There’s sort of a trend in comic writing -- especially with those comic writers with stand-up roots, like Louie -- towards surreal story lines. Why do you find this appealing?
Well, without getting too egghead-y, I think that doing surreal comedy -- Eddie Izzard is one of my favorites for this -- can be pretty allegorical and can provide a whole bunch of different approaches to comedy that aren’t restricted by the audience’s need to believe that what they’re hearing is 100 percent true. They can just kind of revel in the craftsmanship of the writing and really enjoy the standup that they’re seeing without trying to parse it for plot holes, which is what we all do instinctively when we listen to a story.

Your show tinkers with language -- in particular, the current jargon trends from which words like “millennial” spring. I read in a review that you have a scene mocking a fellow employee whose title is “brand ambassador.” What are some other millennial stereotypes you like to explore?
I don’t think “brand ambassador” is a millennial stereotype, but I do think that it’s a pretension that’s aimed at millennials. I think that it’s pretty condescending that young people are kind of spoken to in a jargon-y way like we aren’t clever enough to see through it, and I know that young people -- this is born out by studies and stuff -- resent brands and language that sound similarly tin-eared.  I don’t discuss stereotypes, but more address myths, I guess? I don’t like the myth that we’re lazy. I don’t like the myth that we’re apathetic and disconnected from other people in real ways. I don’t like the (seemingly contradictory, but very popular) myth that we’re over-saccharine. I don’t like the myth that says that young people are entitled or that we think we know better than everyone else.  Alex Edelman: Millennial at SubCulture in New York City on Wednesday, May 20, at 8:00 p.m."
ARTS & CULTURE,"I believe that Diego Rivera's and Frida Kahlo's frescoes, currently at the Detroit Institute of Arts and Jean Michel Basquiat; The Unknown Notebooks, currently at the Brooklyn Museum since last Friday, are examples of a curatorial trend in which the life of the artists is transformed into the source of artistic value of the art displayed. This, of course, diverts the focus from the art object to those things that, allegedly, inspired those works of art. This means that we are looking at the art of the past with the spectacles we use to justify art fair prices these days.  A couple of years ago in Art Basel, I asked a very important collector about his favorite artist. He mentioned an Asian artist whose name I do not remember. He builds barges with the wood recovered from wrecked fishing boats found in the shores of the Pacific island where he comes from. So, in his case, the source of artistic value does not lay in the art object's ""form,"" but in the ""hardships and pain"" that the materials used allegedly, contain. This is not very different to the way relics used to function a few hundreds of years ago.  Filling several galleries at the Detroit Institute of Arts, Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo in Detroit coalesces around a masterpiece that is part of the Detroit Institute's building.Detroit Industry is an idealized ode to the city in 27 frescoes. These formed the project that brought Diego Rivera, one of the three best known Mexican muralists, to Detroit in April 1932, accompanied by his much younger wife, Frida Kahlo, also an artist.  Over the next 11 months, Rivera researched, designed and painted the frescoes that cover the four vaulting walls of the museum's courtyard, now known as the Rivera Court. It features heroic scenes of muscular workers and even more idealized earth mothers grasping sheaths of wheat or armloads of fruit.   Frida Kahlo's time in Detroit was painful and, from a visual perspective, his work has nothing to do with the monumentality of his husband's masterpiece. When she arrived, she was well along in synthesizing the influences of Mexican folk art and surrealism into a mature vision. But in many ways, the miscarriage she suffered while in Detroit spurred the searing form of self-representation that is her contribution to art history.  This miscarriage was the second physical trauma of her fraught, intensely creative life, the first being a near-fatal traffic accident in Mexico City in 1925, which caused her continual pain for the remainder of her life and severely reduced her chances of having children. Thus, this show is only interesting from the point of view of the reconstruction of the context in which Rivera's mural (so important for the city of Detroit) was produced.  That is why Roberta Smith is right to point out in her New York Times piece that ""the 70 works included in the show form a kind of contest between a hefty hare and tiny tortoise. Rivera takes up most of the room -- as, tall and bulky, he did in real life -- but Kahlo emerges in the final galleries as the stronger, more personal and more original artist."" However, I wonder whether this is a fair assessment of the showing. Do we need a show to know that Frida Kahlo's works are more personal? Is it better art because is more personal? Is it relevant to show a political artist along an existential surrealist? It is as if  contemporary taste privileged that inversion of the low over the high where the underdog or the ""small"" and ""flawed"" becomes ""art.""  Something similar happens with Basquiat's show at the Brooklyn Museum, which is built around 160 pages from eight notebooks in the collection of Larry Warsh. The show holds no startling revelations -- the notebooks are ""unknown"" only in the most literal sense that they have never been exhibited before. But they confirm the centrality of language and hand lettering to Basquiat's art in new detail. Organised by Dieter Buchhart, an independent curator and Basquiat specialist working with Tricia Laughlin Bloom, a curator at the museum until December, this show displays the notebook drawings in long rows in low-slung vitrines or on the walls, are supplemented by about 30 other works: drawings of several kinds (including a fabulous one involving a triangle filled with words and symbols, 10 feet across) and a handful of works on canvas that demonstrate how language was carried over into painting. Basquiat began by collaging canvases with scores of drawings or color photocopies of them, and then adding larger images, like the black mask-skull on an untitled work from 1982-83, a griot surrounded by a swarm of words.  The show considers that Basquiat's decision not to write or draw on the backs of the pages automatically transforms them into autonomous works of art. To make things even worse, in the exhibition's catalogue, Buchhart considers this ""notes-cum-drawings-cum-artworks"" as examples of ""concrete art."" I understand his scholarly excitement when working with the notebooks of his favorite artist. The problem, however, is that it ends up unnecessarily injecting meaning to an already magnified aspect of Basquiat's work, and I wonder whether this doesn't follow the aforementioned mechanic of inverting ""the low over the high"" in order to justify the over-inflated value of contemporary artworks. Just a thought."
ARTS & CULTURE,"When Mary Fleener was 8 years old, she was snooping around her family’s basement when she stumbled on a trove of unfinished drawings. They depicted, in undone but strangely fluent lines, iconic Disney characters — Mickey Mouse, Bambi and Goofy, among others. When Mary asked her mother, Virginia, where they came from, Virginia explained that she made them, years ago, while working for Walt Disney. Mary was floored. She knew her mother only as a stay-at-home mom. “I was like, what?” she recalled in an interview with HuffPost. “You were a cool person who worked for Disney?” The discovery of the trashed Disney drawings astounded Mary, now a successful comic artist in her 60s, for two reasons. First, there was the shocking realization that her mother had a secret career as a professional animator. Just as confounding, however, was the subsequent revelation that every single frame of every single animated movie she loved was made by a human hand. “It hit me that this stuff was drawn by people,” she said. By people, yes. And often, in some way or another, by women. According to Walt Disney himself, women were ideal candidates for his company’s early ink and paint department, responsible for bringing dimension, depth, detail and color to early 20th-century animators’ drawings. Mindy Johnson writes as much in her book Ink & Paint: The Women of Walt Disney’s Animation. Sure, it was the animators, predominantly men, who were responsible for drafting Disney characters’ initial forms and movements ― and as the originators, they were viewed as the “most-skilled artists,” Johnson notes. But it was the inkers and painters who stepped in after the animators’ job was done, to refine and enhance their designs. The jobs required immense composure and precision, traits frequently associated with femininity at the time. As a press release from Walt Disney Studios in the 1920s explained, “Girls not only have more patience and a finer sense for detail, line, and color — they have infinitely more patience to do a more finished type of work so necessary for this work on celluloids.” In the 1920s and throughout the 1930s, the ink and paint department was the only creative department in the Disney Studios open to women. Even more disheartening, the department recruited only those under the age of 35. One call for artists from the time, discovered by Johnson, reads: “Women over thirty-five have shown that their muscles start to stiffen and that they cannot master a pen and brush technique so well as younger girls.” Around 1934, however, Disney began to make more of a concerted effort to incorporate women into the workplace. Beyond working as secretaries and stenographers, a few also climbed the ranks of the company’s creative fields. Bianca Majolie started at Disney that year, eventually becoming the first woman to work as a storyboard artist, the lone woman in a room with 15 men. While the men prided themselves on slapstick humor and silly gags, Majolie incorporated emotion into her story arcs, which would become a staple of Disney’s animation formula. She eventually created story outlines for classics like “Cinderella” and “Peter Pan.” Hazel Sewell, Walt Disney’s sister-in-law, also made waves as an art director in the 1920s, working on films like “Snow White” and “Bambi.”  Yet the majority of women still worked in ink and paint, where they were separated out from the rest of their colleagues in a self-contained wing of Disney’s Burbank offices. Johnson believes the gender segregation stemmed, in part, from an effort to keep women ― new to the workplace environment dominated by men ― relatively comfortable. But the quarantine was also a safety precaution. The ink and paint department worked with nitrate cellulose, a highly flammable material, so it was necessary for the department’s employees to operate in a contained workspace. If a cigarette-smoking animator were to drop by, for example, he could set the department alight.   “Even the slightest speck of dust, on screen, looked like a boulder,” Johnson told HuffPost. “You couldn’t have people traipsing though; it had to be a controlled and contained environment.  “This was not Betty Crocker’s kitchen,” she added. “This was Madame Curie’s lab.” Since she was a young child, Virginia Fleener dreamed of being a costume designer, of translating her love of drawing into some kind of career. “My mother was a seamstress,” the 95-year-old told HuffPost. “I grew up loving the feel of materials.” But Fleener’s aspirations changed course when she entered college, fell in love and got married. “I decided I wanted to have some children and be a housewife, a homemaker,” she said. Then in 1941, less than a year after her wedding, Fleener’s husband was drafted by the Navy to fight in World War II. Like many women at the time, Fleener suddenly found herself in need of a job. Meanwhile, the war had thrown Disney’s cartooning department into chaos. Some employees enlisted, others were drafted, and those who remained were relegated to making war-related training videos. Almost overnight, Johnson said, the campus came to resemble a military base. Employees had to wear ID badges, as well as sign in and sign out every day. “You didn’t know what you were working on because, in order to keep the studio going, they were making a lot of military training films, a lot of which were top secret,” Johnson said.  As for the ink and paint department, it was down to almost half its size in ’41 compared to the year prior. So the Disney Studios began distributing messages to local art schools throughout Los Angeles and placing ads in local papers. One read: “Do you want a career in art? Walt Disney needs young women who have had training in pen and ink work, now! A real opportunity for the girl who excels.” Virginia Fleener saw one such ad, applied and ― at 20 years old ― got the gig. “It was a very nice place to work at the time,” Fleener recalled. “One time I got on the elevator, and there was Walt Disney!” She began in the ink and paint department in 1942, but just a few weeks later, Fleener was transferred to the animation department, the section of Disney off limits to women a decade before. “The Studio will lose quite a few of its men to the armed forces,” detailed a 1942 memo from the Walt Disney Studios archives. “Should many more be called, it is not impossible that girls will be trained for jobs now held only by men.” Soon women were working in the camera and editorial departments, and because Disney was unionized, the women were able to vie for fair compensation. “They put down their brushes and picked up pencils,” Johnson said. After the war, however, many men returned to their previous Disney posts, pushing women back into inking and painting. Their pay, if increased in the war-time era, was docked as well, Johnson said. Fleener doesn’t remember feeling discriminated against at her workplace. When asked if she ever faced sexism or any sort of gender-based harassment, she responded, “We didn’t think that way then. We heard about things going on in Hollywood. There was always gossip, but we didn’t know whether it was true.” Fleener was one of the first women to break into the boys’ club of animation, and many more followed suit. Jane Baer started working at Disney in 1954 as an animator for “Sleeping Beauty.” At 20 years old, Baer was one of 10 women brought on for the film, all of whom worked together in a big room Baer referred to as the “bullpen.” She is the only one still alive today. “They thought hiring girls was a good idea because we had the right delicate touch to do the fine lines on princess Aurora,” Baer told HuffPost. Baer, now 83, grew up in Winnipeg, Canada, where she lived what she called a “regular life.” Her parents had saved enough money to send one of their children to college ― Baer’s brother. “Why waste it on a girl?” Baer said. “In their minds, I would just get married and have babies and that would be that.” Although her father had encouraged her to take art classes growing up, he never considered the possibility that his daughter could see drawing as anything more than a hobby. “We were expected to be stenographers and secretaries ― to get married and have babies,” Baer said. “My mother never worked after she got married, never drove a car. It was just different.” Yet Baer, who described herself as “very stubborn,” was undeterred. Set on becoming an artist like her dad, Baer decided the first step on her path to a career was attending the ArtCenter College of Design in California. “If I was told I couldn’t do something, I would try to do it,” she said. “My father wouldn’t finance my ArtCenter venture, but I was going to do it one way or another.” Baer was accepted to ArtCenter and paid tuition herself with money she earned working as a graphic designer at the time. She bunked with an older Texan woman who had recently gone through her fifth divorce, and Baer earned her keep by cooking and cleaning. Shortly after she graduated, luckily enough, Disney was hiring. The women working on “Sleeping Beauty” became fast friends, in part, Baer said, because the competitive atmosphere common in male-dominated workspaces was absent. Like Baer, many of the women she worked with were raised to be secretaries, wives and mothers. “We didn’t have any aspirations to do anything more than what we were doing,” she said. “We weren’t discouraged but we also weren’t encouraged to become top animators. We were content, to a degree, doing what we did.” Although gender stereotypes potentially capped Baer’s ambition, she said her experiences with men in the workplace were overall positive. “The [men] would come by after lunch and tease [the women] and keep us from working,” she said. “We got blamed for encouraging it. But there was no sexual stuff that I was aware of. There were no Harvey Weinsteins, at least to my knowledge. The old men treated us very nicely.” Baer worked on Disney films including “The Black Cauldron” and “The Prince and the Pauper.” In 1984, she opened her own animation studio, Baer Animation, with her husband at the time, Dale Baer. She later worked on the iconic “Who Filmed Roger Rabbit,” creating the dizzying Toon Town sequence. But it was Baer’s first film, “Sleeping Beauty,” that inspired a young Gretchen Albright when she was a kid. The classic fairy tale was Albright’s favorite movie. “I’d pretend I was getting the characters ready for their performance with these stickers my mom got me,” she recalled. Albright, now 67, was drawn to the film industry from a young age, in part because her father worked as a grip for 50 years. She never imagined herself pursuing animation, but in 1972, after she’d graduated from UCLA with a French degree, she saw Disney was hiring in their Xerox department. She applied and got the job. “It’s not like the Xerox machine that most people are familiar with,” Albright warned. “It is a three-room process.” Before long, Albright was transferred to the ink and paint department as a painter. To her, the job felt like the grown-up extension of a ritual she cherished so much as a child, dressing up “Sleeping Beauty” stickers in pretty outfits. “In painting you were doing just that,” she said, “putting colors onto the characters so they could perform in their final stages. It was just amazing, I thought, ‘I cannot believe I get paid to do this.’” Because of her grueling work hours, Albright said, she and the other women in ink and paint “bonded like sisters.” Together, they worked on Disney classics including “The Little Mermaid” and, her personal favorite, “The Lion King.” Albright’s tenure was long enough that she spent time in every part of ink and paint, eventually running the entire division, and proceeded to help usher Disney animators into the digital age. In all her time at Disney, she said, she recalled only one minor incident with a male colleague. “A male co-worker was carrying this massive phone-looking thing past the paint lab and I made some remark about it being quite large. He said something like, ‘Want to try it out?’ I thought, ‘Oh, that’s not quite the right thing to say.’ But he probably thought he was being funny. It never happened again.” The Disney offices Albright remembers were still somewhat segregated by gender at the time. When she started there she noticed “there was a club-type thing on the third floor of the animation building that was pretty much men only.” Albright didn’t think too much about it, especially given that her realm of the office was all women. “I was more interested in what we were doing than who we were doing it with,” she added. Virginia Fleener didn’t recall experiencing any off-color remarks from men at work, but her daughter Mary remembered one strange incident involving, appropriately enough for the animation world, a drawing. Mary said that one day when she was about 21, her mother ducked out of work to go to a dentist appointment. When Virginia returned, there was a drawing on her desk of a woman in a dentist chair with a man peering so deeply into her throat he was inside her. The caption read: “This might hurt a little.” “There was flirtation back then. It wasn’t all squeaky clean,” Mary said of her mother’s era. “She has a lot of caricatures men drew of her. A lot of these guys were probably up to no good like they are today. Even though they were drawing Bambi, they were dirty old men.” Baer, Fleener and Albright all attested that their workplaces were, overall, safe spaces for women to cultivate their skills, different from the toxic and misogynist environments described in recent news stories. Earlier this month, Disney Animation head John Lasseter announced that he was taking a leave of absence from Pixar, following accusations of behavior that left his co-workers feeling “disrespected or uncomfortable.” It is possible predatory bosses were not as prevalent in the ’40s, ’50s, ’60s and ’70s as they appear to be today, but it seems likely the behavior we now recognize as problematic was perceived as normal in mid-century workplaces. Included in Johnson’s book is an excerpt from a 1919 secretarial guidebook detailing how women should react if their male superiors acted inappropriately. Although it wasn’t culled from the Disney vault, it speaks to the behaviors expected of women at the time. “She must learn not to see that his glance is too fervid, not to feel that hand that rests on hers.” If a woman was to respond, she should do so with “tact and politeness, for it is not the rebuff that counts so much as the way in which it is done.” Looking back, Baer concluded that Disney was more patriarchal an atmosphere than she realized at the time. But she’s confident that, with time, the climate has changed. “There is still a boys’ club going on, but the door is getting pushed open now, thank God,” she said. “The mindset is opening up and fresh. It isn’t closed to women like it was. Even though it was never spoken about, it was there. You just knew not to push it too much or you’d be classified as a pushy broad. Not today. It’s very encouraging.” Today, Jane Baer is 83, Gretchen Albright is 67 and Virginia Fleener is 95. Many of their co-workers are no longer living, but the three women look with warmth, if not utter amazement, at the next generation of comic artists, especially the women, who have the high expectations and big dreams they didn’t. “In today’s world, women can do anything,” Baer said. “I went to an animation convention over the weekend and was amazed by the number of young women there with incredible talent interested in all facets of animation. I was blown away. The door is pretty much wide open.” Today’s young women animators surely benefited from women like Baer, Albright and Fleener, who proved that women have far more to offer the world of animation than a “delicate touch.” Women are now represented in almost every aspect of production, though still in lackluster percentages. In 2015, women made up 10 percent of animation directors and producers, 17 percent of writers, 21 percent of art/designers and 23 percent of animators, according to the Animation Guild. Organizations like Women in Animation are devoted to tipping the scales further; it is currently working toward equal employment for men and women on animation productions by the year 2025. Mary Fleener, in particular, attributes much of her success to the fact that she grew up with a “mother who did art when she wanted, the way she wanted. I inherited her art genes and I would use her art supplies.” Mary’s work is a far cry from Virginia’s. Instead of smiley princesses and anthropomorphized woodland creatures, Mary draws bawdy, underground, feminist comics including her semi-autobiographical series “Slutburger Stories.” The name riffs off a derogatory term for a promiscuous woman. The cover of the first edition of “Slutburger” features a woman in a cubist style, as if made by Picasso’s feminist cousin with a soft spot for hallucinogens. The surreal babe sits in an oversized martini glass, her green, pink, purple and yellow legs fanning out beneath her in multicolored high heels. Her face is a jigsaw puzzle; her many arms cast her as a party girl Kali ― she uses some to pose, others to caress herself, giving shape to the constant multitasking intrinsic to the feminine experience. There is a magic to Disney’s “Sleeping Beauty,” which tells of beautiful princess Aurora who is cursed by the evil fairy Maleficent to remain in a deep sleep until true love’s kiss awakens her. Yet the classic film, based off the story by Charles Perrault, doesn’t do much for gender representation in 2017. After all, Princess Aurora spends most of the story unconscious. But without an animated character like Aurora, who Disney bosses thought required a woman’s hand to render, there may never have been a Slutburger, bursting out of a martini glass with her nipples exposed. Aurora might live happily ever after, but Slutburger gets to live on her own terms."
ARTS & CULTURE,"On May 10, 1950, the body of an unidentified woman with red hair and freckles was found in Bath, West Virginia. An unnamed individual had been mushroom hunting along U.S. Route 522 when he stumbled upon the Jane Doe. Forensic experts determined that she was between 35 and 50 years old at the time of her death, and that she had undergone a hysterectomy and appendectomy -- her scars said as much. But little more knowledge came of investigations.  She remains anonymous to this day.  This story is one of many unsolved cases presented in Sarah Honan's project ""Blink.,"" a series of portraits aimed at recognizing, honoring and memorializing the women who've lost their identities to forgotten crimes. Consisting of 18 painted and illustrated renderings of Jane Does, the artworks attempt to crack open an archive of over 2,000 unidentified women in morgues and unmarked graves across the United States. ""For years I have been bewildered by how we seem to ignore the crises women face across the world today,"" Honan explained in an email to HuffPost. ""Be it the atrocities we see in the developing world or the sheer lack of female political representation in the developed world."" She started her series after coming across the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, an online record of the unsolved deaths of women in America. Inspired by the ""horrors"" she saw during her research there -- the countless women, from various walks of life, whose identities had been stripped from them in death with no recourse -- she decided that she wanted to give these women a voice, to ""allow them to speak for every woman and girl who has ever been physically or emotionally abused because of her gender."" Nineteen-year-old Honan originally presented her project, made possible through pledges via the Ireland-based, crowdsourcing site Fundit, as an installation in Waterford City, Ireland last month, as part of a backdrop displayed in the window of an unused storefront. Now the images, along with the forensic information Honan collected for each portrait, can be found on the ""Blink."" website.  ""Blink. should act as both a personal memorial for each individual represented but also enter a very public forum,"" the artist concluded. ""My goal has always been to have the tragic stories of these women inspire dialogue on the issues they represent. Although they may have become anonymous in death, I hope that Blink. gives them the opportunity to change even the way one person thinks about identity, about gender-based violence and about the representation of women in society.""

ARTS & CULTURE,"According to the Southern Poverty Law Center ― an organization that tracks hate crimes and promotes tolerance ― there are currently 101 anti-Muslim groups in America, out of 917 total hate groups. According to The New York Times, anti-Muslim hate crimes were already rising in 2015, which saw a 67 percent increase from the previous year. But add to this President Donald Trump’s proposal, initially banning immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S., and religious discrimination seems to be mounting.  While Trump’s travel ban applies the same restrictions to all members of Muslim-majority nations, projecting a message many have viewed as intolerant, Muslim book publishers are aiming to do just the opposite. A recent report on Publisher’s Weekly highlights several Muslim presses working to shed light on the nuances of Islam, and of its practicers.  Reporters Marcia Z. Nelson and Emma Koonse spoke with publishers that issue updated translations of the Quran, books about Islam for non Muslim-readers, academic titles encouraging readers to think critically about religion, children’s books with Muslim protagonists, and YA books bolstering Muslim voices.  Of the diversity of perspectives on offer by these publishers, Publisher’s Weekly writes: Despite the nuances found in the Muslim publishing industry, one common goal between publishers is clear: to provide resources that accurately represent beliefs and experiences of distinct and numerous communities of Muslims in the U.S. and around the globe. The work of promoting a complex vision of Muslim identity isn’t to be shouldered alone by Muslim presses. Another publishing house, Comma Press, vowed to only publish books by authors from the countries affected by the travel ban until it’s fully overturned. “Personally, I’d much rather hear voices from Somalia, Yemen or Iran than have to listen to yet another news report about the new show business that is U.S. politics,” publisher Ra Page told The Huffington Post.  Libraries are also doing their part to provide accurate information about Islam, and to report any hate crimes that may happen within their walls. To this end, the American Library Association started the hashtag #LibrariesRespond.  While a response system is valuable, Muslim presses could offer something that treats the gnarled root of hate: visions of religious identity that are too complex to be stereotyped, and too full of humanity to be ignored.  For a thorough list of Muslim publishers, see Publisher’s Weekly’s profile. "
POLITICS,"Running for political office is not out of the question for Cecile Richards. “Never say never, right?” the former Planned Parenthood president recently told Refinery29.  Richards, 60, served as the women’s health organization’s president since 2006 and announced she was stepping down in January. The lifelong feminist activist and organizer published her first book in April, titled Make Trouble: Standing Up, Speaking Out, and Finding the Courage to Lead-My Life Story.  “Don’t box yourself out,” she told the publication. “I think as women, we need to have more tapes in our head that say, ‘You know, I could do that.’ And so, I never want to say there’s something I’m not going to do. There’s no reason to foreclose things.” While Richards has vowed to stay engaged in activism and political organizing, she has yet to elaborate on the details her future plans hold.   “Helping other people organize ... to hold people in office accountable for issues that matter, that brings me real joy,” she said. “I’ve seen the power of people organizing together ... and there’s a role for that that’s as important as having good people in office.”  When Richards announced she was leaving Planned Parenthood earlier this year, she said that leading the organization “has been the honor of my lifetime.” “Together, we have made real progress in this country, expanding access to services and making reproductive rights a central priority of our nation’s health care system,” she said in a statement. “I’ve been an activist my entire life — and that won’t stop any time soon.” "
BUSINESS,"Google will make a fresh foray into the smartwatch market by releasing two new devices in early 2017, a company product manager said in a report published Thursday.  Google, which has lagged behind smartwatch rivals Apple and Samsung, will begin selling Android Wear 2.0 watches in next year’s first quarter, Jeff Chiang told The Verge.  “We are working with a partner OEM on flagship watches for Android Wear 2.0,”  a Google spokesperson said in a statement. The devices will be known by the partner’s name, rather than Google’s.  New features in the Wear 2.0 platform include apps that wearers can run without a phone, and support for Android Pay and the voice-operated Google Assistant, The Verge reported. Many customers with existing Android Wear watches will get an update to the 2.0 platform. Tech blogs such as Android Police have been covering leaks about the watches for months. The devices had been nicknamed Angelfish and Swordfish in those early reports, and they may wind up looking like this, according to Android Police. The Android Wear watches face competition from several established companies and uncertain consumer demand. Reports this fall were divided over whether smartwatch shipments plummeted or surged in the past year.  Despite beating Apple into the smartwatch market in 2014, Android Wear hasn’t kept up with its rival, according to Wearable. Samsung Gear rolled out its latest wearable, the S3, in August, well ahead of the holiday shopping season. Fitness device maker Fitbit, meanwhile, acquired watchmaker Pebble this month.  Check out The Verge’s article for more hardcore specs about Google’s latest gadgets.

ARTS & CULTURE,"There’s a great novel inside of you, just waiting for the moment to burst out. Not sure about that? Take J.K. Rowling’s word for it. In a series of tweets ― inspired by one from Beauty Jackson, a podcast host and blogger with a sizable Twitter following ― Rowling encouraged creatives to never give up on their passion projects, even if the odds of success seem insurmountable. Here’s the original tweet, which Rowling quoted: HEY! YOU! You're working on something and you're thinking ""Nobody's gonna watch, read, listen."" Finish it anyway. There were so many times in the early 90s when I needed somebody to say this to me. It's great advice for many reasons. https://t.co/tiGpAOb4Fh In a long thread, she extols the value of finishing work even if it never finds an audience, the lessons learned by persevering in creating art, and the importance of remembering that success is not a true measure of quality. The discipline involved in finishing a piece of creative work is something on which you can truly pride yourself. Maybe your third, fourth, fiftieth song/novel/painting will be the one that 'makes it', that wins the plaudits... Maybe your third, fourth, fiftieth song/novel/painting will be the one that 'makes it', that wins the plaudits... ... but you'd never have got there without finishing the others (all of which will now be of more interest to your audience.) Easy for her to say, right? If every struggling author eventually had a smash-hit debut novel that left them multi-millionaires, if not billionaires, then, well, money would probably cease to have much meaning. It’s been well-documented how winding, and often difficult, a path Rowling took to superstardom ― a single mother who’d worked for Amnesty International and taught English in Portugal, she found herself scraping by to support her daughter in Edinburgh on state benefits while she toiled on her Harry Potter manuscript and trained to teach. After all that hard work, the book was rejected somewhere between “loads” and “12” times by publishers before Bloomsbury took a chance on the magic of Hogwarts. And, to be clear, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone wasn’t her first novel. She wrote her first book at 6 years old; it was about a rabbit. The point is, creating stuff ― whole-cloth, out of your brain ― is difficult, and it can be exhausting. It’s especially exhausting when your work isn’t appreciated, after all the thankless hours you invested in it. But if you’re really determined and you believe in yourself, maybe you just need a solid pep talk to carry you through the tough times ― and J.K. Rowling always serves the good stuff."
ARTS & CULTURE,"As the comic industry grapples with the revelation that new Marvel editor-in-chief C.B. Cebulski posed as an Asian writer for a year, real writers of Asian descent are speaking up.  Joshua Luna and Trung Le Nguyen, who’ve both been involved in comic projects tied to the Asian-American experience, chatted with HuffPost following Cebulski’s admission. The new editor-in-chief, confirmed that he’d written under the Japanese-sounding pseudonym “Akira Yoshida” in the early 2000s. Cebulski had even created an elaborate false backstory for Yoshida, drawing criticism from people of Asian descent who labeled his actions as “yellowface.”  Cebulski released a statement saying he had been “young and naive” at the time and the issue was “all old news that has been dealt with.” But both Luna and Nguyen feel that damage has been done.   “It’s equal parts shocking, disappointing and discouraging,” Luna told HuffPost. “It’s not necessarily strange to use a pseudonym, but to use an Asian pen name when someone’s not of Asian descent is wild to me, especially when so many actual Asians are constantly denied access to these kinds of opportunities.” Luna explained that Cebulski’s actions sting in part because of Marvel’s long history of problematic representation of Asians in its comics. Its “Iron Fist” series has been criticized for perpetuating a white savior narrative. “Daredevil” received backlash for its ninjas who were given little more than two-dimensional, stereotypical stories. And “Doctor Strange’s” Tibetan “The Ancient One” is thought to be another incarnation of the “old Asian sage” stereotype. The list goes on, as Gizmodo points out. All these titles made it on screen and little was done to remedy the issues in the plots. In fact, actress Tilda Swinton even ended up whitewashing the part of “The Ancient One.”  What’s more, the company once blamed diversity for a dip in sales following a 2014 push for inclusion ― a claim that the Independent proved untrue as diverse stories including “Ms. Marvel” and “Black Panther” were both top selling comics.  Luna wonders that with such an attitude towards inclusion at Marvel, perhaps Cebulski’s Yoshida has harmed writers of Asian descent. “It makes you wonder just how many Asian comic book writers were turned away because an “Akira Yoshida” was already filling the “Asian quota.” With Cebulski moving forward as editor-in-chief, Luna says that it appears Marvel hasn’t learned its lesson. He believes that the company’s insistence that inclusivity and racial sensitivity are important to them is a “hollow” statement.  “This ‘Akira Yoshida’ story sends yet another message of Asian culture being desired, but not actual Asian people,” he said.  For Nguyen, who goes by “Trungles” professionally, Cebulski’s actions have greater implications that extend beyond the confines of comics. Cebulski’s choice to pose behind an Asian name exemplifies a privilege that Asian immigrant families simply are not afforded.  “Asian-Americans, have had to adapt more English sounding names in great part to help ensure economic survivability for ourselves and our families. It’s a necessity for the sake of our access to professional advancement, to jobs,” Nguyen explained. “In Cebulski’s case, he’s a white man who’s taken on a Japanese pen name, [circumventing] internal rules of employment, while also lending a veneer of credence to the purported ‘Japaneseness’ of his writing.” Nguyen called the act of adjusting a name for profit or just to assume an aesthetic, rather than for survival, “troubling.” Moreover, Cebulski’s remark that the situation had been “dealt with” made it seem as though the editor-in-chief was “one-and-done” when it comes to learning from the matter, Nguyen said.  In light of the backlash that ensued following another incident in literature in which it was revealed that a poem by “Yi-Fen Chou,” in the 2015 edition of Best American Poetry, was actually penned by Michael Derrick Hudson of Fort Wayne, Indiana, Luna feels that Cebulski should step down. But only time will tell if Marvel is willing to truly make moves towards real and responsible diversity. UPDATE: Dec. 20 ― In a statement to The Atlantic on Dec. 17, Cebulski said he was “truly sorry for the pain, anger, and disappointment I caused over my poor choice of pseudonym.” He referred to the decision to use the Yoshida name as a “misstep” and mentioned that since the news broke, he’s spoken with “talent close to this issue” and has had discussions around being “mindful of the voices behind them.” “My passion has always been about bringing the best talent from across the world to work on the best stories in the world, and I’m hopeful that fans and creators alike will join us in that continued mission,” he wrote.  His remarks, however, failed to win over critics who pointed out that he only apologized for the use of the pseudonym itself but did not acknowledge the consequences of assuming a Japanese-inspired identity."
BUSINESS,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Takata Corp, the firm at the center of the auto industry’s biggest ever product recall, filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States and Japan, and said it would be bought for $1.6 billion by U.S.-based rival Key Safety Systems. In the biggest bankruptcy of a Japanese manufacturer, Takata faces tens of billions of dollars in costs and liabilities resulting from almost a decade of recalls and lawsuits. Its defective airbag inflators have been linked to at least 17 deaths around the world. Takata Americas, its U.S. arm, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware on Sunday with liabilities of $10 billion to $50 billion, while the Japanese parent and subsidiaries filed for protection with the Tokyo District Court early on Monday. Takata’s total liabilities stand at 1.7 trillion yen ($15 billion), Tokyo Shoko Research Ltd estimated. Final liabilities would depend on the outcome of discussions with carmaker customers who have borne the bulk of the replacement costs, a lawyer for the company said. The filings open the door to the financial rescue by Key Safety Systems (KSS), a Michigan-based parts supplier owned by China’s Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp. In a deal that took 16 months to hammer out, KSS agreed to take over Takata’s viable operations, while the remaining operations will be reorganized to continue churning out millions of replacement airbag inflators, the two firms said. Takata will also receive a $227 million lifeline from its main lender, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, in the form a debtor-in-possession financing. KSS would keep “substantially all” of Takata’s 60,000 employees in 23 countries and maintain its factories in Japan. The deal is meant to allow Takata to continue operating without interruptions and with minimal disruptions to its supply chain. “We believe taking these actions in Japan and the U.S. is the best way to address the ongoing costs and liabilities of the airbag inflator issues with certainty and in an organized manner,” Takata CEO Shigehisa Takada said in a statement. Takada said he and top management would resign “when the timing of the restructuring is set”. His family - which still has control of the 84-year-old company - likely would cease to be shareholders. Jason Luo, president and CEO of KSS, said in a statement the “underlying strength” of Takata’s business had not diminished despite the airbag recall, citing its skilled employee base, geographic reach and other safety products such as seat belts. The companies expect to seal definitive agreements for the sale in coming weeks and complete the twin bankruptcy processes in the first quarter of 2018. The filings have, however, not resolved all issues, as Takata still needs to reach agreements with its carmaker clients on how to divvy up recall costs. Honda Motor Co, once Takata’s biggest customer, said it had reached no final agreement on responsibilities for the recall. Like other Japanese automakers, Honda said it anticipated difficulties in recovering the bulk of its claims. “We are already beyond the point where there is room for negotiations or complications,” said Julie Boote, analyst at market researcher Pelham Smithers in London. ”(Automakers) know they’re not getting the money back but need the inflators.” Takata faces billions in lawsuits and recall-related costs to its clients, including Honda, BMW, Toyota Motor Corp, which have been paying recall costs to date. It also faces potential liabilities from class action lawsuits in the United States, Canada and other countries. Global transport authorities have ordered about 100 million inflators to be recalled, as the ammonium nitrate compound used to inflate has been found to become volatile with age and prolonged exposure to heat, causing the devices to explode. Industry sources have said that recall costs could climb to about $10 billion. Takata produces roughly one-quarter of all replacement inflators, according to Valient Market Research, making it a significant supplier for now even as many automakers have shunned the company for future contracts. Recall costs so far have pushed the company into the red for three years, and Monday’s bankruptcy filings marked a low point of a slow and steady downfall of Takata, which was founded as a textiles company in 1933 that used its weaving technology to make lifelines for parachutes. It began producing airbags in 1987 and at its peak became the world’s No. 2 producer of the safety product. It also produces one-third of all seatbelts used in vehicles sold globally, along with other components. The Tokyo Stock Exchange said its shares would be delisted on July 27. The stock has collapsed 95 percent since January 2014 as the recalls mounted. ($1 = 111.3000 yen)    "
POLITICS,"President Donald Trump needs at least $22 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall he wants to build, so a Tennessee lawmaker has introduced a bill that would let him crowdfund the money. The Border Wall Trust Fund Act, introduced Friday by Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.), would “allow the secretary of the Treasury to accept public donations to fund the construction of a barrier on the border between the United States and Mexico, and for other purposes.” Under the bill, the treasury secretary would establish an account for the donations and “create a publicly accessible website to receive such gifts.” The bill also calls for money to be used to construct a mile-long “commemorative display” to honor donors — unless the “secretary determines that length to be impracticable.” When Black appeared on Fox News Monday to discuss the bill, host Harris Faulkner shot back: “What happened to Mexico paying for it?”— which Trump repeatedly vowed would happen, despite Mexico’s clear objections. Black, who’s running for governor of Tennessee, said that while she would like to see Mexico pay for the structure, she was uncertain “what kind of pressure” the Trump administration was putting on Mexico for the funds. Black said she has received a positive response to the bill. She said people can send money to the federal government for the wall now, but there’s no current guarantee the funds would be spent that way. Black explained that her bill would “dedicate a fund” for the wall. The congresswoman said that she and her husband would be the first to write a check if the bill becomes law, but didn’t say how much they would donate. In March, $1.6 billion in U.S. taxpayer money was earmarked for ongoing or planned border projects, but that didn’t include money for constructing Trump’s wall. Early this month, the president threatened to shut down the federal government if he didn’t get wall funding. The Department of Homeland Security has estimated that the proposed border wall would cost at least $21.6 billion to build, though another estimate goes up to $70 billion. USA Today created an interactive map of existing barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border."
BUSINESS,"I find myself increasingly encountering the term, “public-private partnership.” Today, I read two articles centered on this idea, both of which concerned Vice President Mike Pence – and one that concerned Pence’s role in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. One article also included a sprinkling of US secretary of [privatized] education, Betsy DeVos. A major goal of corporate education reform is to deliver public education to private entities (corporations, or even nonprofits, but don’t think that an entity termed “nonprofit” cannot be a handsome money dispenser for those running the nonprofit and doling out contracts). However, the extreme-right-Republican aim does not end with public education but with delivering the operation of the entire American infrastructure to private entities. In the end, what this entails is having private corporations front money to state and local governments in order to lease back to the public what the public already owns. Think of Chicago’s parking meter fiasco. From the May 23, 2016, Chicago Sun-Times: In the public-private partnership, the private entity rakes it in – and the public is thrown into crisis. But let us return to VP Pence. On June 08, 2017, Donald Cohen of In the Public Interest published this post about Pence’ canceling a PBS interview “out of the blue.” It just so happens that a failed public-private partnership connected to Pence was hitting the news. As Cohen writes: In January 2017, Naomi Klein wrote this Intercept article tying Pence with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina– and with the public-private-partnership concept: What could be more lucrative than using crisis (or manufacturing crisis, if necessary) and combining that fear-instilling atmosphere with a little front-end cash in order to beef up corporate profits? That, my friends, is a public-private partnership. In fact, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)– which actively encourages public-private partnerships, including offering model legislation (see here and here and here and here)– will have stalwart voucher promoter, Betsy DeVos, as a featured speaker at its Denver conference in July 2017. Heads up, America: The sharks are eyeing your public infrastructure. *** Longer version originally posted 06-11-17 at deutsch29.wordpress.com. ***  "
ARTS & CULTURE," I am a working photographer, trying to adapt, like many of my colleagues, to the rapidly changing landscape in the profession we love. Today I would like to get a straight answer to a simple question: something that could help me terminally understand the current state of photography business better than any elaborate or academic theory. Momentarily detached from the viewfinder, my eye briefly fell on the  ""shot on iPhone 6"" campaign, where Apple is using clever, funny, colorful, sometimes truly lovely photos, taken with the device, from various parts of the world. Then, I came across several articles in the social media celebrating these wonderful pictures used by Apple in their campaign (""yeeees, taken with an iPhone!!.... can you believe it?? !!! How cool is that??""). Then I noticed a selection of these images reproduced all over the web, on huge billboards, etc. and became aware that the photographer's credit appears on the photos (at least on those I saw today on the walls of Penn Station, here in New York), albeit not in full, but abbreviated. I am familiar with the fact that Apple often welcomes iPhone photographers to publicly showcase images created with smart phones and edited with various ""apps"" in many of their stores across America, projecting the photos on a screen, during a Q&A session. I also happen to know, based on personal experience, that Apple does not allow photography or videography during such events and does not compensate in any way the photographers they invite to present their work. So, going back to the latest ""shot on iPhone 6"" Apple campaign, I ask myself: Has Apple given any compensation at all to the selected photographers for such a widespread and massive usage of their images on many platforms? Or have the creators of these photos just all agreed to donate their visual work, free of charge, feeling amply compensated just by the ""coolness factor"" of having their images used by Apple in such a grand scale campaign across America and the world? At a time when many of my colleagues passionately debate about integrity of photo-journalism, while prestigious photographic prizes are awarded only to be hastily revoked after a few days, while photographic budgets and assignments suffer from an increasingly dysfunctional ""shrinkage factor"", while we are more confused than ever about copyright, licensing and attribution issues, I simply ask myself: Has Apple paid any bloody money at all for the images used in this promotional campaign for their latest phone? I haven't been able to find an answer to this simple question yet and already a new, more important question in my mind: Do we call this photography democratization or exploitation?"
ENTERTAINMENT,"Fans of HBO’s “Game of Thrones” waiting for the hit show’s eighth and final season may be getting a huge reward for their patience ― an epic battle scene that tops anything the show has ever done before. Popular fan site Watchers On The Wall reportedly unearthed a since-deleted Instagram from assistant director Jonathan Quinlan congratulating the crew for its efforts while filming in Toome and Magheramorne in Northern Ireland. Quinlan, has helped shoot 20 episodes of the series so far, shared a photo of a note from the producers that described “enduring 55 straight nights” in production. Watchers On The Wall suggested the lengthy shoot was likely a major battle scene. A spokesperson from HBO confirmed that “a crew person posted congrats to his colleagues for finishing up a run of night shoots,” but declined to specify how long the shoot took. HuffPost has reached out to “Game of Thrones” creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss for comment, but has not heard back.  The “Battle of the Bastards,” an ambitious battle scene that appeared in the show’s sixth season, took 25 days to shoot. The note also described how the crew put up with “the cold, the snow, the rain, the mud, the sheep shit of Toome and the winds of Magheramorne.” “When tens of millions of people around the world watch this episode a year from now, they won’t know how hard you worked,” the note read. “They won’t care how tired you were or how hard it was to do your job in sub-freezing temperatures. They’ll just understand that they’re watching something that’s never been done before. And that’s because of you.”  The note is signed by “The Producer Types.”  In February, Belfast Live reported a huge blaze at a “Game of Thrones” set in Toome that was understood to be part of filming for a battle scene. The final season of “Game of Thrones” is slated to be released in 2019. In January, HBO programming president Casey Bloys told Entertainment Weekly that the delay is meant to give Benioff and Weiss extra time to create the final six episodes of the show. “As the show has gone on, it’s gotten bigger — big battle scenes, big special effects,” Bloys said. “These things take time.”"
POLITICS,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis’ top lawyer Felix Ehrat is leaving the Swiss drugmaker, saying a $1.2 million contract he co-signed with U.S. President Donald Trump’s personal attorney was a mistake. The contract with Michael Cohen’s Essential Consultants, the same firm used to pay porn star Stormy Daniels, has distracted Novartis’s efforts to improve its image. “Although the contract was legally in order, it was an error,” Ehrat, 60, said on Wednesday. “As a co-signatory with our former CEO, I take personal responsibility to bring the public debate on this matter to an end.” Novartis ended the $100,000-per-month contract, signed in early 2017 by Ehrat and former Novartis Chief Executive Joe Jimenez, this year. It was part of efforts to learn more about how the Trump administration might approach U.S. healthcare, Novartis said. U.S. lawmakers have demanded Novartis and AT&T, which also made payments to Cohen’s firm, provide details and Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, has initiated an investigation. Ehrat, Novartis’s general counsel since 2011, had been expected to leave within the next 1-1/2 years, while Jimenez stepped down on Feb. 1 and was replaced by Vas Narasimhan. Novartis has said Narasimhan had nothing to do with the Cohen contract and Chairman Joerg Reinhardt said that the board of directors was not aware of it at the time it was signed. Ehrat will be replaced by chief ethics officer Shannon Klinger who Narasimhan elevated to the executive committee this year as he made cultural change a priority. Novartis said she had not been aware of the Cohen contact. Narasimhan called the contract a major mistake at a meeting with investors in Basel and said Novartis is developing a principles-, not rules-based system to avert corruption. “There will always be a way around the rule, whereas if you ask the question, ‘Is this the right thing to do, are you comfortable with this being on the front page of the newspaper?’... that’s going to help get us to a better place.” Since 2015, Novartis has paid out hundreds of millions in settlements and fines as a result of kickback allegations in South Korea, the United States and China and faces an investigation of alleged bribery in Greece. A trial for another U.S. kickbacks case is scheduled for 2019. Novartis shareholders have urged Narasimhan to exert more “moral influence” over perceived ethical shortcomings that Jimenez in 2016 blamed on a “results-oriented” sales culture and some bad actors. Klinger cited changes to bonus schemes for Novartis’s drug sales force that are meant to avoid potential for corruption. “Any one sales rep can have no more than 40 percent (bonus), so we think that by doing this we have also embedded our values and behaviors for our sales reps,” she said.  Narasimhan highlighted a dozen medicines in its pipeline that Novartis believes have $1-billion-plus annual sales potential, placing it on track to grow sales and expand profit margins through 2022. The company will also consider pruning non-core operations, including its U.S. generic pills business, while weighing further bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen its drug portfolio. Novartis is also considering whether to spin off its Alcon eye surgery division, with any move likely in early 2019, while priority areas for M&A include cancer medicine, cell and gene therapies, liver disease and digital and data science. Narasimhan made a big bet on gene therapy with an $8.7 billion deal to buy AveXis last month. But Novartis is unlikely to mimic deals such as Takeda’s $62 billion takeover of Shire which are transforming the pharmaceuticals industry, Chief Financial Officer Harry Kirsch said. “I don’t think there is a domino effect if some others were to merge or acquire large scale, that our hands would be forced in any way,” Kirsch told analysts.  (Additional reporting by Ben Hirschler in London; Editing by Michael Shields/Louise Heavens/Alexander Smith)"
ENTERTAINMENT,"Mark Wahlberg dropped by “The Ellen Degeneres Show” Wednesday, chatting about ― among other things ― how he keeps his preternaturally buff bod in shape.   Wahlberg recently upped his workout regimen in preparation for his upcoming role in “The Six Billion Dollar Man,” and hasn’t been shy about showing off the results on Instagram. Still, he admitted there are two people who are consistently unimpressed.  “My daughters [Ella Rae, 14, and Grace, 8] get very annoyed by the pictures,” he told the host. “I get ‘Dad, put a shirt on,’ all the time.” A post shared by Mark Wahlberg (@markwahlberg) on Mar 31, 2018 at 9:01pm PDT He continued, “At first, they don’t like it when I scare the boyfriend. And then, all of a sudden, they’re like, ‘Oh Dad, can you come see me at school?’ Because they want me to scare the boyfriend.” Also in the interview, Wahlberg explained how fatherhood inspired his plans to reboot the classic children’s program, “Captain Kangaroo.”  “I’ve been trying to figure out cool ways to get my kids to be interested in science, technology, engineering ― things like that,” he said, before presenting Ellen with a red blazer in the style of original “Captain Kangaroo” star Bob Keeshan. “We are bringing back a cool STEM scientist as Captain Kangaroo.” "

BUSINESS,"Just over a month after Republicans pushed through a sweeping corporate tax cut from which Bank of America stands to gain billions of dollars, the bank is set to start charging its poorest customers $12 a month for the privilege of having a checking account. The charge, implemented earlier this month, applies to customers with an “eBanking” account, which was free for anyone who didn’t receive paper statements or use bank tellers. Bank of America has phased out eBanking and transferred those customers to “core checking accounts” that require them to contribute a direct deposit of at least $250 a month (that’s $3,000 a year) or keep a minimum daily balance of at least $1,500 to avoid the $12 monthly fee. Most national banks with a physical presence have similar requirements for free checking accounts, according to a comparison tool on Bankrate.com. Credit unions and online-only banks, however, often don’t have a monthly charge.  While $12 a month might seem manageable, that’s not the case if you can’t meet the new minimum qualifications for a free account in the first place, NPR’s Steve Inskeep notes: $12 per month for a checking account?Some math: If you have $1,000 in the account, $12 is 1.2% of it—per month.Multiply by 12 months: people without much money are charged an annual rate of 14.4% for the bank to hold their money and process checks. https://t.co/emxDj2Pw3w The timing of the bank’s decision, right on the heels of a massive Republican-backed corporate tax cut, drew outrage across the internet. A Change.org petition protesting the bank’s decision had more than 86,000 signatures by Wednesday afternoon. Among U.S. banks, Bank of America is one of the largest beneficiaries of the corporate tax cut, according to an analysis the investment bank KBW shared with HuffPost. Analysts at KBW predict Bank of America’s earnings will increase 17.8 percent in 2018 once the tax cut is factored in, compared to an expected 13 percent earnings increase for banks overall. Assuming KBW’s estimates hold, that means the bank could pocket an additional $3.8 billion or so in 2018. (Bank of America turned a $21 billion profit in 2017.) Bank of America spokeswoman Betty Riess told HuffPost the termination of eBanking isn’t “new or recent,” despite what it seems. The bank stopped offering the account five years ago and has been slowly migrating customers into different accounts ever since, she said. Riess couldn’t say how many eBanking customers were affected by the final account closures this month. For fee-conscious customers who don’t meet Bank of America’s minimums, Riess noted the bank offers a “SafeBalance” checking account with a $4.95 monthly fee, but it doesn’t allow for overdrafts. Lack of access to traditional banking services forces marginalized people into the hands of even riskier financial institutions, like predatory lenders, which exacerbates poverty, says Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a nonprofit organization that fights inequality.  “Poor people who are denied access to traditional bank services are left vulnerable to costly check-cashing outlets, pawnshops and other predatory services,” said Kristen Clarke, the group’s president and executive director, in a statement. “By pushing poor people into the dark world of alternative financial services characterized by higher fees and exorbitant interest rates, low-income communities are at risk of being thrust into further economic distress.” Clarke said the bank’s action would disproportionately affect African-American and Hispanic consumers, who have historically been excluded from banking services at higher rates.  A 2015 study by the FDIC found that 7 percent of American households ― approximately 9 million households ― don’t have a bank account."
ARTS & CULTURE," Raise your hand if you've seen a bunch of women dancing together in a music video. (Everyone raises hand.) Now, raise your hand if you've ever witnessed a swarm of lady strangers from different locations and backgrounds, of all different ages and body types, join together for one epic day of avant-garde costumes, weird improvised dancing and a whole lot of femme positivity. (Anybody?)  Allow us to introduce you to ""The Weird Girls Project,"" an ongoing experiment celebrating feminism, creativity and, obviously, being super weird. The brainchild of artist Kitty Von-Sometime, the project subverts the music video format, transforming the badass ladies who take part from backup dancers to alien super-vixens, at least for the day.  Von-Sometime was inspired to launch the project after moving from the UK to Iceland, finding herself in an all-female social circle for the first time. ""When I started hanging out with more women I became much more aware of the 'does-my-bum-look-big-in-this?' scenario. I noticed many women... when we were out in public, they seemed much more self-conscious about how they looked. The more I got to know them, the more I realized many of them had suffered with severe body issues, or had had extreme confidence problems."" The aforementioned issues are nothing new, and are often wildly exacerbated by mainstream music videos and its restrictive visions of female beauty. But, for Von-Sometime, the music video format offered a space of possibility. ""I was raised in a very non-artistic family,"" she explained. ""The way I got exposure to visual references was basically '80s videos and the beginning of MTV. Now it's become such a massive machine, but when it first came about, people were really trying to translate music into the visual realm. And that was really interesting to me."" ""The Weird Girls Project"" got its start almost by accident, when Von-Sometime turned the tail end of a casual party into a sort of video experiment. ""Everyone [at the party] seemed in a really good mood about themselves after,"" she explained simply. Over time, the ventures became more organized, as well as far more popular. What started out as an activity among friends, morphed into a happening for women from all over the world, lined up to participate in Von-Sometime's unconventional feminist performances.  ""There's quite a long wait list now,"" Von-Sometimes said.  Those who do get the chance to participate in a work sign up for a set date with absolutely no idea what's in store for them. Von-Sometime carefully concocts a concept, costumes, makeup and set -- in secret. For example, in Episode 15, titled ""Beauty is only skin deep,"" the women converged in an old fishmeal factory, where they donned white body paint, monstrous contact lenses and lots of fake blood to transform into a tribe of ""self-mutilating female creatures."" The narrative, riffing on the widespread obsession with plastic surgery, featured the tribe capturing a young girl and attempting to recruit her into their ruinous lifestyle. Once the women arrive on set, they're challenged to adjust to the carefully fabricated environment that awaits them. ""Basically, I am a total control freak,"" Von-Sometime explained. ""I spend a very long time planning. I try and provide a very structured environment, and within it, I try to encourage women to move in their own way and do what they're comfortable with... One woman described it as having a chance to express herself, but without having to take full responsibility. I put her in this set-up and then she's free to improvise.""  ""The Weird Girls Project"" videos include a Renaissance disco rave at a ruined monastery, an apocalyptic meltdown at an abandoned fake Disneyland theme park in China, and a witchy ritual to awaken a dark spirit. Part Cindy Sherman, part Kenny Scharf, part Spencer Tunick, it's the best feminist costume-party-turned-avant-garde-masterpiece you never knew you needed.  And Von-Sometime's newest video is her most body-centric yet. ""It's about the women literally loving themselves,"" she explained. ""In this one we covered them from top to toe in gold to represent their self worth. It was very interesting to hear the women's commentary on how they felt. Everyone felt glorious, even though I think it was physically uncomfortable to have glitter literally everywhere.""  The day-long happening provided participants with a wholly unconventional and empowering experience, intended to combat conventions far after the last speck of glitter washed off. ""The overwhelming push behind this project is to highlight how women are very different and yet the same. We're showing that everybody is as equally striking or stunning or beautiful or magical."" See Episode 16 of ""The Weird Girls Project,"" titled ""Embrace Yourself"" and head to the website to learn more.   "
POLITICS,"Sometimes it feels like we already know everything about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, given her transformation into the pop culture icon known as “the Notorious RBG.” The documentary “RBG,” premiering Friday, is one of two movies about her being released this year. (Another television project was announced this week, a miniseries that will chronicle her and Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, the first two women on the high court.) Further proving her cultural ubiquity, “RBG,” directed by Betsy West and Julie Cohen, features footage from her many speaking engagements in recent years, employing recurrent punchlines and anecdotes. The justice has extensively discussed her storied career fighting gender discrimination, her late husband, Marty, championing her work, her “odd couple” friendship with conservative Justice Antonin Scalia — and, on the lighter side, her famous fitness regimen. In that way, much of the documentary, a celebratory and endearing portrait of the feminist pioneer, covers familiar territory. But it manages to sidestep “the easy narrative” of Ginsburg as a “badass” by illustrating the “paradox” of how she “still feels more comfortable in the world of words and text than in the world of fame and notoriety,” as Slate’s Dahlia Lithwick wrote earlier this week. Part of that paradox emerges in the through-line connecting Ginsburg’s entire legal career, that true and lasting change is slow, often happening in stops and starts, two steps forward, one step back. In addition to her approach to the law, this also comes through in Ginsburg’s personality. Despite her ebullient public persona, her family, friends and colleagues often describe her in the film’s interviews as “reserved,” “quiet” and “timid.” Yet, as NPR’s Nina Totenberg recounts, Ginsburg could be “a performer” and rise to the occasion when it mattered, like during her Supreme Court confirmation process. For the most part, as depicted in the documentary, Ginsburg let her reputation precede her, through hard work and having every possible legal strategy at the ready, in order to outmaneuver her opponents. It’s inspirational when so often women in the public eye get derided for being overprepared. “RBG” deepens viewers’ legal knowledge by documenting her years at the American Civil Liberties Union’s Women’s Rights Project, introducing the audience to some of the plaintiffs she represented.  During these cases, instead of getting frustrated by male judges who ridiculed her and could not seem to grasp the scope of gender discrimination, Ginsburg patiently educated them on legal history, seeing these moments of animosity “always as an opportunity to teach,” as she says in the film. “One of the things I tried to plant in their minds was, think about how you would want the world to be for your daughters and granddaughters,” she recalls. According to the film, she was focused on changing the system from within, smartly recognizing that the best strategy was to build a bulletproof legal doctrine through each gender discrimination case that she took on. “I said, it’s too soon,” she said during her Supreme Court confirmation hearings in 1993, recounting one of her earlier cases. “My expectation, to be candid, was that I would repeat that argument maybe half a dozen times. I didn’t expect it to happen in one fell swoop. I think generally in our society, real change, enduring change, happens one step at a time.” The approach may have appeared “conservative,” as Kathleen Peratis, a former director of the ACLU Women’s Rights Project, says in the film. But eventually it paid off. Similarly, Ginsburg had criticized the landmark Roe v. Wade decision establishing a woman’s right to an abortion because she feared, rightly, that a sweeping ruling would galvanize activism against abortion. Instead, she argued for individual state laws, which some legislatures were already on their way to passing. While watching Ginsburg’s career unfold in the documentary, it is hard not to think of the current moment, with the Me Too and Time’s Up movements already generating forms of backlash. While change has happened, it is still slow. There are reminders of this throughout the documentary, when Ginsburg is shown in rooms full of men, arguing cases before panels of male judges, facing questions at her confirmation hearing before a Senate committee. Today, men still outnumber women in countless positions of power. And yet, when asked about the current moment, Ginsburg seems clear-eyed. “When I see women appearing every place in numbers, I’m less worried about a backlash than I might have been 20 years ago,” she said at the documentary’s Sundance Film Festival premiere in January, arguing that now “the law is on the side of women, or men, who encounter harassment, and that’s a good thing.” In some ways, the law still favors perpetrators, and the work of her generation certainly remains unfinished. But Ginsburg’s confidence that permanent change is possible comes from the perspective of someone who has seen it all and has done what women often do — put our heads down and do the work. ‘RBG’ is in theaters Friday and will air on CNN later this year."
ENTERTAINMENT,"“Infinity War” screenwriters Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus helped to clear up what some fans believe to be inconsistencies with the timeline of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a conversation with Collider published this week. **WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD** One big question is, when exactly does Thanos retrieve the infinity gauntlet? If Asgard protects the forge that creates the gauntlet, and Asgard isn’t destroyed until 2017′s “Thor: Ragnarok,” then why do we see Thanos with the gauntlet after the credits in 2015′s “Avengers: Age Of Ultron”? Wouldn’t someone have been notified? “I think the Gauntlet was made when Loki was pretending to be Odin,” Markus told Collider, at about the 38:20 mark in the video above. “Presumably, Eitri was running a relatively regular business and people would come there for things and somebody would have said something.” In other words, with Loki impersonating Odin after the events of 2013′s “Thor: The Dark World,” and Loki’s motives always being morally ambiguous, we have to assume he looked the other way while Thanos had the gauntlet made. Fans don’t seem too bothered by the issue, considering that “Infinity War” has grossed more than $600 million domestically, according to Forbes.  That said, we still have some questions of our own. In “Infinity War,” because the handle of Thor’s axe Stormbreaker is made of Groot, why doesn’t the handle disappear when Groot disintegrates at the end? Perhaps we’re overthinking these things."
ENTERTAINMENT,"To those who made it through the latest (and messiest) season of “American Horror Story,” well, congrats, because we bailed around the time Lena Dunham’s character was revealed to be the Zodiac killer.  For rest us, a new installment thankfully is on the way, and creator Ryan Murphy is already dropping hints about what Season 8 will look like. At a panel with “AHS” cast members Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Cheyenne Jackson, Billy Eichner, Adina Porter, and Leslie Grossman, the prolific producer announced they all will return for the show’s next season, which will be set in the “near future.”  “I will say it is set 18 months from today,” Murphy told the crowd after each of the cast members asked him a yes-or-no question about the future of the series, according to Variety.  That timeline puts the next season somewhere around October 2019, which by our estimate has nothing particularly exciting going on besides John Krasinski’s 40th birthday and, of course, Halloween.  Murphy also revealed that the new season will be “fantasy inspired” and “heightened,” mirroring the tones of previous well-received chapters like “Asylum” and “Coven.”  Peters, who will also try his hand at directing this season along with Paulson, will play a different character of sorts after his intense turn as a Trump-supporting lunatic.  “Your part this year is a comedic part,” Murphy told the actor. “You are our comedic and you play a hairstylist.” Legendary actress Joan Collins will be playing Peters’ grandmother, Murphy confirmed, and Angelica Houston has been tapped to star in an unspecified role.  The new season is set to begin filming around June 16, but FX has yet to announce a release date. Murphy, meanwhile, has his hands full with “American Crime Story,” “9-1-1,” “Feud” and his new drama “Pose” on the horizon. "
BUSINESS,"John Kenneally, a Monster Energy vice president accused of sexually harassing two different women at the company, has resigned after HuffPost published details of his behavior last week.  Yet the company is standing by two other men also embroiled in misconduct accusations and related lawsuits. The company’s head of music marketing, Brent Hamilton, is awaiting trial on felony charges for allegedly strangling his ex-girlfriend. Phillip Deitrich, another manager, stands accused of bullying a female subordinate in front of her male colleagues and sabotaging her ability to work. Both men still work at Monster. The female Monster employees involved lost their jobs. Kenneally, a 60 year-old Atlanta-based executive named in two sexual discrimination lawsuits filed last year against the drinkmaker, was gone by Friday, according to one current and one former employee at Monster Energy. A spokesman for Monster would only confirm that the company “accepted his resignation,” meaning it didn’t implore him to stay. His interim replacement is Andrew Wilkinson, another executive at Monster, the company confirmed. A former female employee’s lawsuit describes Wilkinson as enabling Kenneally’s behavior. During his time at Monster, Kenneally started up a romance with a colleague, Page Zeringue, convincing her to take a promotion working for him. When their relationship soured, he turned abusive, sending her lengthy text messages in which he called her a “bitch” and a “whore” and once made a racially charged comment about “black dicks.” He eventually helped engineer Zeringue’s firing, according to her lawsuit. HuffPost published those texts, shocking many current and former employees, who said they hadn’t been aware of the extent of Kenneally’s misconduct.  Zeringue, who remains unemployed, was only slightly mollified by the news. “This is only a small step towards greater justice,” Zeringue told HuffPost in an email. “John was enabled by the founders of Monster ― Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg ― who routinely turned a blind eye to internal abuse while people such as us lost our jobs, life savings, and our futures.”  A Monster spokesman disputed some of Zeringue’s claims when HuffPost reached him on Wednesday. “Messrs. Sacks and Schlosberg,” the spokesman said in a statement, “Take these issues seriously.” “Monster Energy has zero-tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind,” the company said in a statement to HuffPost. “If the company’s discrimination and harassment policies are violated, appropriate action is taken, up to and including termination of employment.” “It is also worth noting that Mr. Kenneally’s resignation was accepted by the Company,” the statement says. Kenneally was on paid leave pending an internal investigation after HuffPost contacted Monster earlier this month about its forthcoming article.   The company, which is partly owned by Coca-Cola, also said the lawsuits women filed against Monster ― five in total ― are unrelated and without merit. A spokesman for Coca-Cola declined to comment on these cases. He did say that the company recently reminded its own employees of its policies on harassment and discrimination and its commitment to not retaliating if someone comes forward to report abuse. The departure of a single man accused of misconduct hardly suggests a culture shift at Monster, a drink company that markets primarily to men, promotes itself with “Girls” dressed in skimpy outfits, makes a beverage called Assault and once produced a Monster-branded condom labeled “unleash the beast.”  It’s notable that the company has not chosen to discipline the other men named in these suits.  Fran Pulizzi, a former business development manager at the company who also sued Monster over Kenneally’s behavior, alleged in her own lawsuit that Kenneally’s interim replacement, Wilkinson, helped enable Keneally’s misconduct. Pulizzi became the target of vicious retaliation after she reported Kenneally’s actions to Monster’s human resources department, according to her lawsuit, which said that Kenneally directed colleagues to stop working with her and addressed her in abusive and derogatory ways. Pulizzi told HuffPost that Keneally also spread harmful rumors about her personal life. Wilkinson was Pulizzi’s direct supervisor for a few months while this retaliation was ongoing, her suit says. And though he was initially sympathetic to her situation, something quickly changed, according to Pulizzi’s lawsuit. Wilkinson stopped returning her calls and emails, she told HuffPost. He also gave Pulizzi a poor performance review after working with her for only a few months, possibly at Kenneally’s urging, according to the suit. It’s upsetting that the company replaced one man, credibly accused of sexual harassment, with another man who enabled that behavior, Pulizzi told HuffPost.  “It tells me nothing’s changed at Monster,” she said. Still, Pulizzi and Zeringue are hopeful that by speaking up about their experiences, something will change. “In the last week, we have heard from scores of Monster employees who are too afraid to speak up,” Zeringue said.  “We hope that our continued attempt to seek justice ― will help alleviate their fears.” Do you have a story about harassment or discrimination that you’d like to share?

BUSINESS,"Few things are as costly and disruptive as managers who kill morale. Demotivated employees underperform and then walk out the door at the first opportunity. The scariest thing is how prevalent this lack of motivation is. Gallup research shows that 70% of employees consider themselves to be disengaged at work. Organizations know how important it is to have motivated, engaged employees, but most fail to hold managers accountable for making it happen. When they don’t, the bottom line suffers. Research from the University of California found that motivated employees were 31% more productive, had 37% higher sales, and were three times more creative than demotivated employees. They were also 87% less likely to quit, according to a Corporate Leadership Council study on over 50,000 people. The Gallup research shows that a mind-boggling 70% of an employee’s motivation is influenced by his or her manager. It’s no wonder employees don’t leave jobs; they leave managers. Making Things Worse Before managers can start creating motivated, engaged employees, there are some critical things that they need to stop doing. What follows are some of the worst behaviors that managers need to eradicate from the workplace. 1. Making a lot of stupid rules. Companies need to have rules—that’s a given—but they don’t have to be short sighted and lazy attempts at creating order. Whether it’s an overzealous attendance policy or taking employees’ frequent flier miles, even a couple of unnecessary rules can drive people crazy. When good employees feel like big brother is watching, they’ll find someplace else to work.  2. Letting accomplishments go unrecognized. It’s easy to underestimate the power of a pat on the back, especially with top performers who are intrinsically motivated. Everyone likes kudos, none more so than those who work hard and give their all. Rewarding individual accomplishments shows that you’re paying attention. Managers need to communicate with their people to find out what makes them feel good (for some, it’s a raise; for others, it’s public recognition) and then to reward them for a job well done. With top performers, this will happen often if you’re doing it right.  3. Hiring and promoting the wrong people. Good, hard-working employees want to work with like-minded professionals. When managers don’t do the hard work of hiring good people, it’s a major demotivator for those stuck working alongside them. Promoting the wrong people is even worse. When you work your tail off only to get passed over for a promotion that’s given to someone who glad-handed their way to the top­­­­­­­, it’s a massive insult. No wonder it makes good people leave.  4. Treating everyone equally. While this tactic works with school children, the workplace ought to function differently. Treating everyone equally shows your top performers that no matter how high they perform (and, typically, top performers are work horses), they will be treated the same as the bozo who does nothing more than punch the clock.  5. Tolerating poor performance. It’s said that in jazz bands, the band is only as good as the worst player; no matter how great some members may be, everyone hears the worst player. The same goes for a company. When you permit weak links to exist without consequence, they drag everyone else down, especially your top performers. 6. Going back on their commitments. Making promises to people places you on the fine line that lies between making them very happy and watching them walk out the door. When you uphold a commitment, you grow in the eyes of your employees because you prove yourself to be trustworthy and honorable (two very important qualities in a boss). But when you disregard your commitment, you come across as slimy, uncaring, and disrespectful. After all, if the boss doesn’t honor his or her commitments, why should everyone else? 7. Being apathetic. More than half of people who leave their jobs do so because of their relationship with their boss. Smart companies make certain their managers know how to balance being professional with being human. These are the bosses who celebrate an employee’s success, empathize with those going through hard times, and challenge people, even when it hurts. Bosses who fail to really care will always have high turnover rates. It’s impossible to work for someone eight-plus hours a day when they aren’t personally involved and don’t care about anything other than your productivity. Making Things Better Once managers have eradicated the seven negative behaviors that demotivate their best people, it’s time to replace them with the following seven behaviors that make people love their jobs.  1. Follow the platinum rule. The Golden Rule (treat others as you want to be treated) has a fatal flaw: it assumes that all people want to be treated the same way. It ignores the fact that people are motivated by vastly different things. One person loves public recognition, while another loathes being the center of attention. The Platinum Rule (treat others as they want to be treated) corrects that flaw. Good managers are great at reading other people, and they adjust their behavior and style accordingly. 2. Be strong without being harsh. Strength is an important quality in a leader. People will wait to see if a leader is strong before they decide to follow his or her lead or not. People need courage in their leaders. They need someone who can make difficult decisions and watch over the good of the group. They need a leader who will stay the course when things get tough. People are far more likely to show strength themselves when their leader does the same. A lot of leaders mistake domineering, controlling, and otherwise harsh behavior for strength. They think that taking control and pushing people around will somehow inspire a loyal following. Strength isn’t something you can force on people; it’s something you earn by demonstrating it time and again in the face of adversity. Only then will people trust that they should follow you. 3. Remember that communication is a two-way street. Many managers think that they’re great communicators, not realizing that they’re only communicating in one direction. Some pride themselves on being approachable and easily accessible, yet they don’t really hear the ideas that people share with them. Some managers don’t set goals or provide context for the things they ask people to do, and others never offer feedback, leaving people wondering if they’re more likely to get promoted or fired. 4. Be a role model, not a preacher. Great leaders inspire trust and admiration through their actions, not just their words. Many leaders say that integrity is important to them, but great leaders walk their talk by demonstrating integrity every day. Harping on people all day long about the behavior you want to see has a tiny fraction of the impact you achieve by demonstrating that behavior yourself. 5. Be transparent. Good managers are transparent and forthcoming about company goals, expectations, and plans. When managers try to sugarcoat, mask, or euphemize in order to make things seem better than they are, employees see right through it. 6. Be humble. Few things kill motivation as quickly as a boss’s arrogance. Great bosses don’t act as though they’re better than you, because they don’t think that they’re better than you. Rather than being a source of prestige, they see their leadership position as bringing them additional accountability for serving those who follow them. 7. Take a genuine interest in employees’ work-life balance. Nothing burns good employees out quite like overworking them. It’s so tempting to work your best people hard that managers frequently fall into this trap. Overworking good employees is perplexing to them; it makes them feel as if they’re being punished for their great performance. Overworking employees is also counterproductive. New research from Stanford shows that productivity per hour declines sharply when the workweek exceeds 50 hours, and productivity drops off so much after 55 hours that you don’t get anything out of the extra work. Bringing It All Together If you cultivate the characteristics above and avoid the demotivators, you’ll become the kind of boss that people remember for the rest of their careers. Have you seen these motivators and demotivators in action? Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.

ENTERTAINMENT,"Cynthia Nixon broke down why celebrities becoming involved in politics wasn’t always such a bad thing on Wednesday’s broadcast of “The Late Show.” The “Sex and the City” star, who is challenging Gov. Andrew Cuomo for New York governor in the state’s Democratic primary this year, agreed with host Stephen Colbert that having a former reality TV star in the form of Donald Trump in the Oval Office “is not working out very well.” But there’s nothing “inherently wrong with celebrity in politics,” said Nixon. “It gives you a platform, but it’s what you choose to do with that platform,” she added. “Do you choose to give yourself and other 1 percenters a massive tax break that they don’t need? Or do you choose to advocate for important things that need your voice, like LGBTQ equality or women’s health or women’s rights.” Check out the full interview above."
BUSINESS,"Pharmacy chain CVS is said to be in talks to buy major health insurer Aetna in what could be one of the largest health sector deals ever, according to multiple reports.  CVS is interested in acquiring Aetna for $200 per share, totaling about $66 billion. The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times have reported that the decision is motivated by the prospect that corporate giant Amazon might move into the pharmaceutical industry.  Amazon already dominates the retail industry with its e-commerce website and has used acquisitions to expand into the media and grocery industries. It has been rumored that the company might break into the health care sphere. CVS Health CEO Larry Merlo spoke to CNBC in August about possible competition from Amazon. “They’ve done a great job, and you don’t take anything they’re doing for granted,” Merlo told CNBC. “But, at the same time, I think we have a lot of capabilities and a value proposition that can compete effectively in the market.” The CVS deal, if it surpasses $60 billion at current share value, would make it one of the largest corporate acquisitions this year and one of the largest ever in the health industry, according to The New York Times. Aetna attempted to buy its competitor Humana in 2016 but was blocked by the Department of Justice based on concerns that the merger would hurt competition in the market. Federal courts upheld the block by the DOJ earlier this year, forcing Aetna to pay a $1 billion breakup fee.  The future of health care in the U.S. remains uncertain as Congress debates whether to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Many of the ACA protections have already been rolled back by President Donald Trump, including birth control protections and federal subsidy payments. Among all the changes, however, the purchase of Aetna would allow CVS more leverage in negotiating with pharmaceutical companies for lower drug prices. "
ENTERTAINMENT,"Kylie Jenner talked about why she enjoys changing diapers, how she and boyfriend Travis Scott came up with the name “Stormi” and what’s changed in her life since becoming a mother in an intimate interview published Wednesday. Kim Kardashian conducted the interview with her younger sister for the Evening Standard, bringing up everything from Jenner’s career to her views on plastic surgery. But the 20-year-old beauty mogul had the most to say about little Stormi. She told Kardashian all about what surprised her most about motherhood and even admitted that she likes changing her daughter’s diapers.  “I think more about the future because of her. Every time I leave and I’m stressed about leaving her, I’m like, ‘I’m doing it for you,’” Jenner said. “Everyone says you change completely when you become a mom, but I really feel the same, just better. So I don’t know what really has completely changed my world, besides her, of course.”  She added, “But I feel like it’s only gotten better. You’re less selfish — and I actually enjoy changing diapers. It’s really satisfying. To make her clean again. And I don’t know, the whole thing is really… it’s like such an amazing experience.”  Scott and Jenner, who are currently on vacation together, celebrated their daughter’s three-month birthday on Tuesday, sharing an adorable photo on Instagram. A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on May 1, 2018 at 8:46pm PDT Jenner noted in the interview that she and Travis were originally thinking of just going with the name “Storm” instead of “Stormi.”  “I really don’t know how we thought of Storm. Her dad insisted it was him, but I feel like it was me. And that kind of just stuck with us,” she said. “And then I didn’t really like just Storm — I didn’t feel like that was her name. So then it became Stormi,” Kylie said. “And it just stuck. I feel like there were a lot of other names that I might have even liked better, to be honest, but I feel like Stormi picked her own name, like it was just her name.”  Jenner said that being a new mom has “been so amazing” and “so much fun” but she admitted things can sometimes be difficult.  “I’m learning so much more about myself and life, and it’s been such a great experience,” Kylie said. “Of course, there’s hard times and stuff … even in the beginning, just not sleeping, the nights, like, baby blues … and all the ups and downs.”  A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on May 1, 2018 at 11:12am PDT Stormi Webster was born on Feb. 1, weighing 8 lbs., 9 oz. She is the first child for both Jenner and Scott, whose real name is Jacques Webster. “Pregnancy has been the most beautiful, empowering, and life-changing experience I’ve had in my entire life and I’m actually going to miss it,” Jenner said in an statement a few days after giving birth. “I’ve never felt love and happiness like this I could burst!”  Read Jenner’s entire interview with the Evening Standard here.

ENTERTAINMENT,"Despite what you may have heard, Ariana Grande still has some tears left to cry.  The pop star became emotional during a candid interview with Time magazine about the terrorist attack that followed her concert in Manchester, England, a year ago that killed 22 people. Grande has been relatively quiet about her feelings about the bombing, preferring to focus on the victims and their families.  “I don’t want to give it that much power,” Grande, sobbing, told the magazine for its Next Generation Leaders issue. “Something so negative. It’s the absolute worst of humanity. That’s why I did my best to react the way I did. The last thing I would ever want is for my fans to see something like that happen and think it won.” “Music is supposed to be the safest thing in the world,” she continued. “I think that’s why it’s still so heavy on my heart every single day.”  After the bombing, the singer said she wanted to cancel her scheduled concerts ― she was midway through the Dangerous Woman tour at the time. Days later, she had an epiphany.  “If I don’t do something, these people died in vain,” manager Scooter Braun said Grande told him at the time. Grande returned to Manchester a month later for a benefit concert alongside artists Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber and Coldplay that raised $12 million for families of the victims.  “I wish there was more that I could fix,” she told Time. “You think with time it’ll become easier to talk about. Or you’ll make peace with it. But every day I wait for that peace to come and it’s still very painful.” In April, Grande dropped her first single after the attack, an anthemic bop called “No Tears Left To Cry” that speaks to her own resilience, as well as that of her millions of fans.  “There are so many people who have suffered such loss and pain,” she said. “The processing part is going to take forever.”  Listen to “No Tears Left To Cry” below: "
ARTS & CULTURE,"In February, the art market was shocked by the news that Marina Picasso, granddaughter of Pablo Picasso and heiress to about 10,000 works by the artist, plans to sell an indefinite number of works to finance and broaden her philanthropy. Ms. Picasso had been regularly selling works by her grandfather for years to support herself and the charities she has founded -- yet, what shocked market speculators was that she planned to speed up this flow, and sell a lot at once. Instead of selling the works through an auction house or art dealer, Ms. Picasso plans to sell each of these works in private sales. Her unconventional approach has art dealers and auctioneers, who are traditionally used to controlling the sales of rare and expensive art, worrying over the potential repercussions. At $449 million sold, Picasso was the world's second highest selling artist at auction in 2014, just behind Andy Warhol. Picasso's famous Femmes d'Alger (1955)  will be offered at Christie's auction house in May 2015 with an estimate of $140 million, and will likely be auctioned for more than Francis Bacon's record-setting Three Studies of Lucian Freud (1969) sold at $142.2 million in 2013, potentially making it the most expensive painting sold at auction, ever. Dealers, auctioneers, and private owners of Picassos have a lot to lose if Marina Picasso floods the market with her grandfather's work, as auction sales and private baluations of Picasso's works will undoubtedly plummet. The story of Marina and the Market offers an interesting case study of the art market, and the role of artworks as investments. The works of name-brand artists such as Picasso, Warhol and Bacon have become very much akin to stocks in name-brand companies such as Apple, Google or Amazon. The sale of Picasso's Femmes d'Alger this year, expected to break the record for the most expensive painting ever auctioned, is akin to Facebook's 2013 IPO, the world's third largest at $104 billion. In an article on the future sale of Picasso's work, Artnet, a prominent online art market watchdog, described the auction house Christie's effort to ""mitigate risk"" by offering a guarantee on the sale. This language is reminiscent of the rhetoric surrounding hedge funds, mutual funds, and the multitude of instruments that our global financial system deals in. Risk is a key factor in this system -- at its most basic level, riskier investments can lead to both higher rewards, and greater losses. The global financial crisis of 2008 is brought to mind, which began because of risky mortgage investments by large banks such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup. This comparison begs the question; will the art market meet a similar fate? People often buy art in the multi-million dollar range not just because they like it (although that may be a factor), but because they think that the work of art will appreciate in value. You buy a stock expecting to be able to sell it for a higher value later -- however, whether or not the value of stock will go up or down from here on out is unclear. Uncertainty is one of the most potent forces in the stock market; as Matthew McConaughey's character said in The Wolf of Wall Street, ""Nobody knows if the stock is going up, down, or in circles."" In many ways, there is much less risk involved with buying a Picasso than buying stock in a Fortune 500 company. Picasso is one of the world's most sought-after painters, and his place has been firmly established in the art historical canon as one of the world's best modern painters, if not the best. Picasso will never go out of fashion, and his works will always be sought after. Picasso was remarkably prolific during his career; the Picasso Project has catalogued upwards of 25,000 works by the artist, and there are doubtless many more. There will always be Picassos to sell, and there will always be someone to buy them.  Yet beyond the Picassos, the Warhols, and works by a handful of modern and historic masters, much of the art that is bought at the big fairs and auctions, which constitutes a large part of total art sales, is from contemporary artists. Preeminent among these is Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons.  Hirst is famous for his record-breaking diamond skulls and embalmed sharks, while Koons is best known for his metallic balloon animals, including a red balloon dog that sold for $58.4 million. However, whether or not future investor-collectors will value works by Hirst or Koons for more than they are valued at now remains to be seen. The global financial crisis of 2008-09 was brought on by the collapse of banks that were heavily invested in subprime mortgage-backed securities, which were based on mortgages extended to people that were unable and increasingly unlikely to repay. Those securities were failed investments -- because so many people defaulted on their mortgage payments, they were bought for more than they would be worth in the future. While it is somewhat of a stretch, the multi-million dollar sales of works by contemporary artists such as Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons are similar to those securities in that there is no guarantee the works will increase in value. The bullish trend in the contemporary art market has built up excitement around particular contemporary artists just as the global financial market had built up excitement around presumably low-risk mortgage-backed securities and other ""new"" financial instruments. Hirst and Koons do not have the same critical validation that Picasso had, and occupy a much less secure place in the art historical canon.  Future investor-collectors will undoubtedly be caught up with some other ""hot"" artists, and those that have bought multi-million dollar works by Koons and Hirst will lose out big time. Because, let's face it, there is absolutely no way that someone would spend $58.4 million on a balloon animal for aesthetic or sentimental reasons.   The investment mindset of collectors and the bullish trend in the contemporary art market has undoubtedly changed the entire art world for the worse. Collectors that buy art because they like it are being crowded out by oil-barons from the mid-east and wealthy investment bankers that instead buy art to invest. Contemporary artists feel increasing pressure to play into the market in order to succeed. It will take a crash-like the global financial crisis to change this speculative attitude towards collecting art, and it is no longer a question if this crash will come, but when."
ARTS & CULTURE,"This week, when performers in Fun Home, Something Rotten!, and the other Tony-nominated musicals are polishing their best number to perform at Sunday's awards ceremony, another group of singers and dancers are basking in the glow of their Broadway debuts.  They're elementary and middle schoolers, more than 1,500 children from 50 schools across New York City and the U.S. who have participated in remarkable private/public partnerships that support the development of musical theater at underserved schools.  The difference between these groups of hardworking artists isn't only professional vs amateur, it's also about race:  a predominantly white group of professional actors and amateur performers who are mostly students of color. In 2005, the Shubert Foundation teamed with Music Theatre International and the NYC Department of Education to launch ""Broadway Junior,"" a yearlong program that helps middle schools produce their first musical.  Disney Theatrical Group created its own elementary school version four years later, now expanded to five cities.  In each locale, Disney Musicals in Schools pairs with a nonprofit performing arts center, which chooses schools that demonstrate need and readiness.  In the era of No Child Left Behind, private and public entities are joining with local school systems, the schools themselves, and dedicated teachers to introduce children to musical theatre. The for-profit entity supplies kid-friendly scripts--30-minute KIDS or 60-minute JR. adaptations of famous shows like Annie and The Lion King--and music re-scored for young voices, as well as professionally orchestrated accompaniment CDs, teachers' guides with how-to instructions on auditions, rehearsals, and performance, and free licensing rights.  Visiting teaching artists support classroom instructors as they learn the skills of musical theatre directors.  Finally, the kids attend a professional Broadway (or touring) show for free.   After months of rehearsals, set-building, props-gathering, and costume-making, the children perform Godspell JR. or The Jungle Book KIDS for their classmates and their families.  The program culminates with the casts from all of the schools gathering at a Broadway (or local PAC) theater for a showcase of musical numbers--one per school--hosted by a celebrity.  The appreciative student audience applauds wildly for their peers' ""Broadway debut.""   Studies have shown the positive effects of kids' participation in the arts.  Musical theater, because it combines theater, music, and dance, requires an extraordinary degree of collaboration.  Children gain reading and interpretation skills; they learn to sing on key; they have to memorize blocking and choreography; they must connect what they say to their facial expressions and gestures.   I visited four Metro Nashville Public Schools--the first DMIS city outside of NYC, which started four years ago--and met with Tennessee PAC staff, teaching artists, and teachers who worked on their school's show all year.  One teacher told me about a boy who learned to read through the rehearsal process.  Another noted that ""the children exert self-control and behave in class because they want to be in the show.""  A teaching artist said, ""I see a change in confidence.  In the beginning most students are shy and nervous. Through the rehearsal process they have to step out of their comfort zone and not be worried if someone is going to make fun of you.""  A 3rd grade girl told me, ""I learned to be brave and that you always have to do your best and it's worth it.""  Every student I met said, ""It was fun!"" In spite of ample evidence that the arts enhance children's intellectual and emotional development, funding continues to be cut across the country.  And this is where corporations can step in.  Skeptics might worry about Disney's over-reach:  don't they already own the souls of our daughters who only want to be princesses?  Haven't we heard ""Let It Go"" from Frozen more than anyone can bear?  Others might fret that musical theater isn't Shakespeare or Ibsen but is popular, mainstream entertainment. But these issues take on a different weight when economically disadvantaged children of color get the chance to perform.  Students play any role, often across gender, and race-specific casting has no traction.  They can pretend, take up space on stage, sing and dance.  When kids are familiar with the stories and the songs, they're eager to commit to this ambitious project. Over the past 10 years, these programs have supported hundreds of performances at more than 150 schools, with well over 10,000 children performing and almost as many helping backstage.  Because the programs aim to seed what they hope will become sustainable musical theater programs, the sponsors gradually reduce support each year, which forces the school to take on more logistical and artistic responsibility.  Almost all of the schools have continued producing musicals; some are now in their 10th year.   I saw a heartfelt and entertaining production of Alice in Wonderland JR. at Wright Middle Prep School in Nashville, in which three girls of different sizes were cast as Alice (at different points in her size-altering adventures), another three girls were cast as Cheshire Cats, and 30 other kids--almost all of them African American, Latino, or Kurdish--filled out the cast.  As they sang, danced, and acted with ferocious commitment and electric enthusiasm, it was clear that this musical was an extraordinarily affirming experience. And I thought about Broadway, so stubbornly white, and the Tony Awards, in which only three actors of color (of 20) are nominated for best performance in a musical.  If musical theater will ever be racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse, this is how it's going to happen, enabled by the organizational machinery, the adaptable repertoire, and the money of the rich corporations that own Broadway.  Though these programs' rhetoric is entirely about process and having fun--their materials say that they're not training professional actors--it's not impossible to envision a girl who debuted as Jasmine in Aladdin KIDS in 2015 landing the role on Broadway in 2025.  In fact, it's hard to imagine she'll get there any other way."

ARTS & CULTURE,"
Kate Arrington, Jeremy Shamos and Sarah Goldberg in The Qualms.
 Photo: Joan Marcus  Bruce Norris, who has given us the award-winning Clybourne Park (about race relations) and the less-successful Domesticated (about the broken marriage of a philandering politician), turns to wife-swapping in The Qualms.  Not wife-swapping exactly, as the mismatched octet Norris assembles includes only one couple that is actually married, but you get the idea. For all the sex setup--there's a big bowl of colored condoms on the side table, which ends up unused but flung across the stage--the author apparently intends for the philosophical bantering among the participants to take the place of any actual action.  They talk on and on about the nature of monogamy, sex, specific sex acts, sex with cows, and even the Hundred Years' War (go figure); but given all the possibilities, and Norris does indeed go into the statistical possibilities of sex among group participants, there is only one actual coupling.   This occurs offstage, among two female characters who are presumably intended to be the two most traditionally attractive cast members.  (There is also the suggestion of other activity in the background, later on.)  Norris, though, plays it safe; while there is a good deal of talk about the naturalness of bisexuality, he avoids suggesting that anything will happen tonight between the men.  The Qualms, like the author's aforementioned plays, originated last July at Steppenwolf.  Pam MacKinnon--whose credits include Clybourne Park and the recent Broadway revivals of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, A Delicate Balance and The Heidi Chronicles--once again directs, as she did in Chicago.  The Playwrights Horizons production is not a transfer, though; the cast--with one exception--is new, although the central couple is played by Jeremy Shamos and Sarah Goldberg, both of whom were prominent in Clybourne Park. Shamos is especially good as Chris, the newby swinger who is decidedly out-of-place.  (Shamos is becoming a familiar face, both on stage and screen; he recently played the annoying actor who was sandbagged in ""Birdman"" and replaced by Edward Norton.)   Norris has Chris deal with his increasing discomfort with inherent politeness, until he reaches the breaking point; then, the embattled character lashes out truths that shatter the attitudes of the group and turn matters violent.  The flashpoint comes when Deb--the significantly overweight member of the orgy--offers to ""rock"" Chris ""like a hurricane"" and he blurts out that he won't have sex with her because of her looks.  The hard-as-nails, trash-talking gal runs off crying.

Rude and not politically correct, but obvious and all too understandable.  In fact, from the moment the final four participants start to enter--the play begins with Chris and his wife Kristy chatting nervously with the relatively presentable host couple--one gets a sneaking suspicion that Norris is setting us up.  Yes, of course there is a ""fat"" girl that our hero will inevitably get stuck with; there is also a fellow who ""looks"" gay.  He keeps accusing Chris of casting aspersions, but the role is written in an unambiguously suggestive manner.  What's more, the character has been cast and directed so that the audience is programmed to make the same assumption. Which takes us to the root problem of The Qualms.  Norris tries to be provocative, but there is the continual feeling that he is manipulating us.  The fat girl is obviously unattractive, at least to Chris; the non-gay guy is obviously questionable.  (He is described in the stage directions as ""in his twenties, black, dancer-ish, model-handsome, aloof."")  Norris wants us to be taken aback when Chris attacks; but the playwright is the one who uses stereotypes to all-too-visibly push poor Chris into the corner.  Thus, the friction is not so real as it is presumably meant to be.   Any number of times during the play, one wonders why this character would even be there.  Norris offers the excuse that Chris caught his wife having lunch with an ex-boyfriend, and is so jealous that he takes her to have sex with a group of strangers.  Hunh???  Chris is as out-of-place as the $150 bottle of cabernet he has brought for the heathenish group, who turn up their collective noses in favor of mohitos and caipharinas.  There are a few places where Chris would and could apologetically write it off as a mistake and simply leave.  But he doesn't, for that would leave Mr. Norris without a play.   Let it be said that Goldberg, at least, makes her character believable; while her husband might feel  out of place, Krissy is primed and ready to indulge in the orgy.  Also standing out, as the hostess Teri, is Kate Arrington.  She is the one Steppenwolf member who recreates her role.  Listening to her extended, run-on speech describing her path from pregnant teenager downhill to suburban swinger, one can instantly understand why Norris and MacKinnon brought her along: Arrington makes this speech funny, touching and believably real.  The rest of the cast makes do with the material, with little help from the speeches the author puts in their scripts. I do, though, like the way Norris ends his orgy with everyone blandly sitting around the coffee table eating Deb's banana cream pudding with separate spoons from a communal bowl.

POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― White House press secretary Sarah Sanders says it bugs her when people accuse of her lying to the press. “It certainly bothers me,” she told The New York Times in a Wednesday article. “Because one of the few things you have are your integrity and reputation.” But Sanders has told lots of lies, and it’s not hard to give examples. PolitiFact cites four times the White House press secretary gave objectively false information. She said in a November briefing that diversity visa immigrants are not vetted (false). She said in an October briefing that Chicago, which has high rates of gun-related crimes, has the toughest gun laws in the country (pants on fire!). She claimed in July that President Donald Trump has “in no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence” (false), despite videos showing otherwise. In March 2017 she said “multiple news outlets” reported that when he was president, Barack Obama ordered wiretapping of Trump (false). Some of the things Sanders has said are laughably untrue. She insisted this month that the Trump administration is “committed to a free press” ― right after Trump hinted at stripping reporters of their credentials and claimed, once again, that mainstream news outlets critical of his presidency are “fake news.” In May 2017, she claimed there was not “ever an attempt” to blame Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, despite a statement that week from then–press secretary Sean Spicer putting the blame squarely on Rosenstein. In her defense, Sanders’ job sounds bananas. She has to provide accurate information given to her by a president who lies all the time. And in this White House, the level of chaos and turnover has been so high, it’s not hard to imagine that something that may be true in the morning is no longer true by that evening. “There’s a difference between misspeaking or not knowing something than maliciously lying,” Sanders said in the Times piece. But part of her dishonesty is in her unwillingness to acknowledge when the president has said something that just isn’t true. When a reporter asked Sanders in October why Trump kept falsely saying that the U.S. is the highest-taxed nation in the world, she gave a hilariously nonsensical answer. In July, when Trump randomly criticized Rosenstein for being from Baltimore, even though he is from Philadelphia, Sanders couldn’t even admit that was wrong. She said Trump was making a “general statement.” Reporters confronted Sanders earlier this month about why she falsely told them that Trump did not reimburse his lawyer, Michael Cohen, for $130,000 in hush money to adult-film star Stormy Daniels just before the November 2016 election. “You said, on March 7, ‘There was no knowledge of any payments from the president, and he’s denied all of these allegations,’” CNN’s Jim Acosta said during the May 3 press briefing. “Were you lying to us at the time, or were you in the dark?”  Sanders said only that Trump still denies the allegations by Daniels. “I gave you the best information that I had, and I’m going to continue to do my best to do that every single day,” she said. As Sanders does her best to be truthful, there’s one group she has no problem calling out as liars: all 16 women who say Trump sexually assaulted them."

The program, offered in the beginning of the year, allows library-goers to return overdue books without paying a fine. Little did the library know there was a book on its way back that technically carried a fine of more than $3,500.  Even so, the library usually caps overdue fees at $5, according to the Chronicle. This isn’t the first century-old library tome to be returned. Last month, the granddaughter of a man who attended Hereford Cathedral School in Hereford, England, returned a book her grandfather borrowed from the school library sometime between 1886 and 1894."
POLITICS,"President Donald Trump spent his first year in office calling for a border crackdown. But there was a problem with his narrative of an urgent crisis: Illegal crossings had dwindled to their lowest number in more than four decades, and many of those coming were families and children.  This spring, he seized on the opportunity to illustrate the border “crisis” he’d been warning of all along: A caravan of Central American asylum-seekers headed for the southern border, at the same time as border agents reported an uptick in border apprehensions. The caravan has traveled to the border each year for a decade, and apprehension numbers, while higher than last year, were well in line with standard trends. But that didn’t seem to matter. Fox News covered the caravan constantly. The president tweeted about it. The Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice made statements targeted at the caravan. The message was that the caravan was a symbol that the border wasn’t secure, thanks in part to “loopholes” for asylum-seekers that the administration wants to eliminate. Citing the caravan and the apprehension numbers, the administration has justified a major policy change and demanded legal reforms that could make it harder for people in danger in their home countries to legally seek asylum in the U.S. On Monday, the administration publicly announced a long-in-the-works policy to prosecute illegal border crossing that is already separating parents from their children and putting asylum-seekers in jail. This comes soon after the president called for the National Guard to be sent to the border, and the DOJ announced it was sending more prosecutors and immigration judges to handle border cases. “This image and the scapegoat that’s being used to galvanize anti-immigrant supporters is something that doesn’t even exist,” said Alex Mensing, an organizer with Pueblos Sin Fronteras, the group that coordinated the caravan. “There’s no horde of invading people using fraud to game the asylum system. That’s not there, and it’s definitely not what the caravan is.” The immigrant rights group Pueblo Sin Fronteras started organizing caravans in 2008 to help people in Central America who wanted to flee danger and to call attention to the plight of migrants. It offers migrants safety in numbers — the journey from Central America to Mexico and then the U.S. can be dangerous. Once at the border it can be helpful to have other witnesses around should U.S. officers break protocol and turn away someone they shouldn’t. Organizers advise caravan participants to go to ports of entry to seek asylum, which is perfectly legal, and many have done so.  The Trump administration hasn’t framed it that way. In an April 23, statement DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the department was monitoring the caravan and that its participants had ”the apparent intention of entering the United States illegally.” A week later, Trump tweeted that the caravan was “openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective U.S. immigration laws are.” On April 30, the DOJ announced the first prosecution associated with the caravan. They alleged 11 people were caravan members, although their arrest reports don’t explain how they arrived at that conclusion. Several of the 11 defendants are challenging their arrests on the basis of discrimination, noting that the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy didn’t lead to the prosecution of Indian nationals traveling in the same group, only to Central Americans.  Overall, the Trump administration has mashed together two issues: illegal entry into the U.S. and asylum-seekers who arrive at points of entry because they fear returning to their home countries. Top officials know that the latter is legal — Nielsen repeatedly said it was the proper channel during a Senate hearing on Tuesday.  But the administration wants to deter people from using it anyway. Nielsen has said in public statements that asylum-seekers should stay in Mexico rather than coming to the U.S. for safety. She and Attorney General Jeff Sessions implied repeatedly that many asylum claims are fraudulent. The claim is that these protections — based on U.S. and international law — are loopholes that are preventing the U.S. from keeping out Central Americans, whom Trump sarcastically referred to last week as “some real beauties.” “There seems to be a working assumption that anyone who expresses a fear of returning to their home country is somehow gaming the system,” Royce Bernstein Murray, policy director at American Immigration Council, said.  Meanwhile, the administration has decried the “crisis” of border crossings, which are tracked by counting apprehensions both at ports of entry and along other places on the border. Numbers increased in March 2018, but then remained about the same in April. They’re considerably higher than the same months in 2017, but those were particularly low ― this year’s crossing numbers are roughly in line with prior years, including a trend of increases in the spring. Last year, illegal crossings were at their lowest point since 1971, with asylum-seeking children and families making up a large number of the arrests.  “They are trying to justify the policies that they’ve already come to the conclusion are good for the country. And so they’re using any statistics that they can put together in order to justify greatly expanding enforcement operations, expending more time and resources on this issue,” David Bier, immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute.  On Monday, Sessions used both the caravan and border apprehension numbers to justify a new DHS policy that will refer all illegal entry arrests to the DOJ for potential prosecution. This was notable because it has already included people that have historically not been prosecuted, such as asylum-seekers and parents traveling with their kids. Locking up parents for prosecution, rather than holding them in immigrant detention, necessitates splitting them up from their children. The policy was a long time coming — the administration has floated splitting up families for a while. It separated at least 700 children from their parents at the border since October 2017. From July to November, it piloted the same “zero tolerance” policy of prosecutions in one sector of the U.S.-Mexico border. During that period, border apprehensions of families who weren’t at ports of entry increased, although DHS claimed the opposite in an internal memo, Vox reported. Sessions implied the policy change was meant, at least in part, as a deterrent to both border crossings and group efforts like the caravan.  “Today we are here to send a message to the world: We are not going to let this country be overwhelmed,” Sessions said in San Diego on Monday. “People are not going to caravan or otherwise stampede our border. ” These prosecutions won’t apply to people who show up at ports of entry, which means it has little to do with the caravan’s participants who did so. At the same time, it will affect other asylum-seekers, some of whom cross the border illegally but then present themselves willingly to Border Patrol. Those aren’t the frightening criminals trying to evade the law that the administration makes them out to be, Murray said.  “Whether it’s an effort to get funding for a border wall, or whether it’s an effort to get tough at the border, or to fear-monger and paint asylum-seekers as part of some dangerous invasion, it all fits into a convenient narrative that immigrants are scary and here to hurt us when they are oftentimes moms and kids looking for help,” Murray said. If families keep coming to the U.S. in spite of the threat of prosecution, more children could wind up going into Office of Refugee Resettlement custody, which has limited capacity to house unaccompanied minors before they are released to sponsors. These prosecutions will also allow the Trump administration to point to a statistic to show how hard they’re cracking down on illegal crossings. Sessions said Monday he wants to double the number of immigration prosecutions this year. Funneling people into magistrate court to convict them of illegal entry typically results in light sentences of a few days, before they are whisked into deportation proceedings ― which could easily rack up successful prosecutions. But immigration prosecutions already take up half the federal criminal docket, sapping the time that federal judges have to hear more serious crimes. All of this almost certainly will be used for more calls urging Congress to change the law to limit the “loopholes” that prevent the administration from keeping migrants out of the country. Many of those so-called loopholes were created to protect both asylum-seekers and children. They include allowing people who express a credible fear of returning to their native countries to make a case for asylum ― not that all of them get it ― rather than being turned away or swiftly deported. They also include releasing families and unaccompanied minors from detention while they undergo their cases, thanks to a decades-old court settlement and law enacted by Congress. During a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Nielsen attributed the increase in asylum claims, family unit apprehensions and unaccompanied minors to people “gaming the system” — rather than problems in Central America. The administration’s framing deceives Americans into thinking asylum-seekers who do the right thing are actually breaking the law, said Marselha Gonçalves Margerin, advocacy director for the Americas at Amnesty International USA. “What the United States administration is doing is criminalizing people, putting people in one basket and saying everybody is criminal,” she said.  “People here in the United States,” she added, “are being told lies.” Roque Planas contributed reporting."

ARTS & CULTURE,"“It is my duty to voice the sufferings of people, the sufferings that never end and are as big as mountains.” ― Käthe Kollwitz The great German artist, printmaker and sculptor Käthe Kolwitz (1867-1945) knew profound personal suffering. After her younger son Peter died in battle in Flanders in October, 1914 she fell into a deep depression that re-shaped both her art and political views. The double sculpture that she finally completed in 1931 for the cemetery in which he son was buried, shows the artist and her husband apparently kneeling in grief. However, when asked about the theme of the sculpture Kollwitz explained that it was about much more than grief: it also represents all parents of her generation, asking forgiveness for having led their sons into war. The Grieving Parents, like so many of Kollwitz’ finest works, is grounded in empathy: the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. She recognized that she was expressing something greater than her own feelings and that her art could only function if it served an entire society. Grief and loss are universal feelings that bind us, and sharing them with others leads to consolation and social transformation. It is not surprising that in 1936 the Nazi party barred Kollwitz from displaying her work which they branded as “degenerate.” Deep feelings for the sufferings and losses of others—which lead to collective introspection—can lead to resistance against authoritarian politicians and those who advocate war and other forms of sacrifice and suffering. It is interesting to note that the idea of empathy is a late-nineteenth/early twentieth century development, that derives from the imaginative act of projecting oneself into a work of art. In her book You Must Change Your Life: The Story of Rainer Maria Rilke and Auguste Rodin, author Rachel Corbett writes: The invention of empathy corresponds to many of the climactic shifts in the art, philosophy and psychology of fin-de-siècle Europe, and it changed the way artists thought about their work and the way observers related to it for generations to come. The development of empathy as a social expectation and custom parallels the development of Expressionism: of inwardness as a gateway to emotional connection. That inwardness—so essential in the modern conception of a self-aware individual—is the hinge that connects to social awareness and the empathetic understanding of others. Empathy is, without doubt, a political force that plays a considerable role in attitudes towards social issues. In a recent article for Psychology Today—Beware America’s Shocking Loss of Empathy—attorney and social advocate David Noise argues that empathy and it’s “cousin” compassion are crucial elements in politics and policy, arguing that they “lead to an intelligent assessment of what is happening internally and around the world, a minimal level of humane values, and rational attempts to apply those values.” In the context of America’s recent Presidential election, where outrage, uncivil discourse and personal attacks demonstrated a shocking lack of empathy, it seems critical for artists to ask themselves about the role of empathy in their own work. Whether their work is political, personal or somewhere in-between, the element of empathy can allow an artist to “give voice to the sufferings of others,” as Käthe Kolwitz did so nobly in her works. Below is a selection of responses posted on my personal Facebook page after I asked the question: What is the role of empathy in your art?  Note: some responses have been edited for brevity. Steven Holmes: Making art assumes empathy. Making art is an act of sharing. It is by definition, an invitation to others to leave their isolation and meet others on the same road as you. An artist without empathy is a sociopath. Mark David Lloyd: Empathy can be painful. Much of my artwork on a conceptual level deals with suffering in one form of another, empathy is experienced in the making process of the artworks and sometimes by the viewer. When we witness suffering and distress in others, our natural tendency to empathize can bring us vicarious pain. Colin Darke: It plays the central role. I only paint or draw in hopes of having a shared experience ― my picture echoing the viewer’s feelings (past or present, happiness/sadness/wonderment) in a new and powerful way. Julia Morgan Scott: I have become somewhat suspicious of efforts to consciously insert empathy into painting. It seems IMHO to politicize something natural to the process of simply painting what one truly loves. Isaias Sandoval-Streufert: For me empathy is essential, without empathy it will be only apathy, my work is about passion, I can’t paint apathy even if I try. Karen Kaapcke: I also have the thought that it is possible that people with high levels of empathy take to the arts as vehicles for that way of being, because it is possibly not an easy way of being (I am thinking of myself when quite young, being almost unbearably disturbed by seeing certain things, or being almost unbearably moved by the beauty of something. Both are equally empathic. A life in the arts might make being that way a little more bearable). Nancy Good: Empathy is key as it speaks the language of connection, i.e. connection to the life experiences of the viewer. We are all connected in pain, joy, fear, wonder, hunger, yearning ... all we experience. Empathy in art banishes isolation and invites healing. Franck De Las Mercedes: Most of my work stems from an emotionally charged, at times dark, at times painful place. To hear others regard it as beautiful or meaningful to their lives is the biggest compliment. The gift is in sharing and understanding the feelings and experiences of another. F. Scott Hess: Empathy is the link that a painter of figures relies on to make others feel the work. It happens before conscious thought, before critical analysis kicks in. You grab your audience by their empathetic guts before they know what’s happening. Gesture, facial expression, movement, composition, and paint application all work together to achieve this end. Judith Peck: In order to create, I have to feel very deeply, without that connection I believe my work would be a hollow shell. Steph Rocknak: From an article I wrote a few years ago: “Psychology, which in many respects grew out of Hume’s work, is helping us to further clarify the fundamental role that empathy plays in our moral sensibilities. Hume’s work, written over two hundred and fifty years ago, is still profoundly relevant. But great artists have always seemed to know what Hume knew; they hook us up to the empathy machine when we become too self-involved, too isolated. For the most part, artists, not philosophers, keep us human; they can put us—no, sometimes force us—into the other person’s shoes. We see what it is like to be a victim a war, we see what it is like to be terribly conflicted, we see what it was like to be trapped inside the World Trade Center on 9/11. Artists can also expose our horror for what it is; we get a look inside the heads of those who know no empathy: the psychopaths, the sociopaths, the narcissists. Sometimes, we even get to see what it is like to live in an entire society that has gone the way of a psychopath. Once again, Bosch and Michelangelo come to mind, or, more recently, Cormac McCarthy’s novel, The Road. “ Dab Zabooty: Without empathy art becomes a technical exercise. Tristan Xavier Köster: In German there is this word “Sympathie” (not to be confused with sympathy) which basically means that you can understand and empathize with somebody(always used positively). I think that this sensation of Sympathie, finds itself in nearly all forms of art, allowing complete strangers to feel and see/hear with the artist. ‪Empathy (veiled by a sense of guilt) fuels just about every single melody I write, but I always try and make sure that my music is “sympathisch” to the listener. Joseph Bravo: Genuine aesthetic communication rests on empathy between the artist and the viewer. If art is to maintain some intrinsic cultural relevance then the audience indeed needs to be broadened. With that broadening of the audience must also come a broadening of the messages and the identity of the messengers as well, even at the risk of a disquieting cacophony. But ideally, each artist would be endeavoring to expand that empathic communication to edify as wide a range of humanity as possible. If artists are to speak with their audience rather that merely at it, then they should seek to find at least a point of common ground on which to plant that seed of empathy. Conor Walton: Empathy assumes reciprocal emotional relations between artist, subject and viewer that are egalitarian insofar as each can identify with the other, and this might naturally be expected to form the basis of an egalitarian art. It might suit a modern style of portraiture or figure painting which takes human equality for granted, but most of the great artworks of the past were produced in a different social context, and embody power relations and notions of social hierarchy that obstruct empathic relations. Are they to be admired less as a consequence? Is a contemporary work that expresses empathy superior to an ancient masterpiece that doesn’t? Or might it be the reverse: that cultivating empathy leads towards an urbane, popular, sentimental art, but places the highest summits of achievement off limits because of its antipathy to the sublime? Vonn Sumner: Empathy is the most important, most essential, most foundational element of painting and drawing. Empathy was the guiding principle of Wayne Thiebaud’s teaching, and he would often state it plainly. He would also say that empathy is the basis of civilization and quote Gloria Steinham: “Empathy is the most radical human emotion.” Joao de Brito: A Portuguese Proverb:”O artista é a voz do povo” or “ artists are the voice of the people” empathy is what is channeled by many artists to express what needs to seen or heard from the public when the world is in confusion. Ingrid Reeve: My art is not about progress; it’s about truth. Empathy is essential for discerning truth. Note: The original Facebook post and all replies can be viewed at this link. "
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — Gina Haspel, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the CIA, told lawmakers on Wednesday that she would not restart the agency’s defunct torture program if confirmed to head the CIA — but she refused to weigh in on the morality of the program. Asked several times whether she thought the so-called “enhanced interrogation techniques” used by the CIA on terrorism suspects in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks were moral, Haspel dodged the question. She claimed the CIA’s interrogation program was legal at the time, and said she now supports limiting interrogation techniques to the ones outlined in the U.S. Army Field Manuals.  “I support the higher moral standard we have decided to hold ourselves to,” Haspel said, pointing to anti-torture legislation passed by Congress years after the CIA shut down its interrogation program. (Torture was already illegal under the Geneva Conventions when the CIA began interrogating detainees using techniques like waterboarding.) The CIA should focus on intelligence collection and analysis and leave interrogations to the Pentagon and the FBI, Haspel said. Haspel, who oversaw a black site where at least two detainees were waterboarded (one of them before Haspel arrived at the prison), faces a contentious confirmation process. Most Democrats are expected to oppose her confirmation because of her involvement in the interrogation program and her subsequent role in destroying videotapes that documented the interrogations. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has also said he will vote against her. Haspel, the current acting CIA director, was expected to assure lawmakers on Wednesday that she would not restart the CIA’s interrogation program — even if ordered to do so by Trump, who has expressed enthusiasm for waterboarding terrorism suspects. But Democrats on the Senate intelligence committee appeared frustrated that she would not outright condemn the CIA’s past conduct.  “I want to see, I want to feel, I want to trust that you have the moral compass that you said you have,” Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) told her. “You’re giving very legalistic answers to very fundamentally moral questions.” Haspel, however, did not express remorse about the CIA’s use of torture. If anything, she appeared frustrated with the continued focus on the matter. “I’m not going to sit here with benefit of hindsight and judge the very good people who made hard decisions, who were running the agency, in very extraordinary circumstances at the time,” she told lawmakers on Wednesday. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) later told HuffPost it troubled her that Haspel did not answer “four different times” whether the CIA’s interrogation techniques were immoral. “I think she knows the answer and she didn’t give it,” Harris said. At one point, Haspel seemed offended by a question about whether she’d called for the interrogation program to be continued as it was winding down. “Let me say this about myself. After 9/11, I didn’t look to go sit on the Swiss desk,” she said. “I stepped up. I was not on the sidelines. I was on the front lines in the Cold War and I was on the front lines in the fight against al Qaeda.” “I’m very proud of the fact that we captured the perpetrator of 9/11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. I think we did extraordinary work,” she continued. “To me, the tragedy is that the controversy surrounding the interrogation program... has cast a shadow over what has been a major contribution to protecting this country.” Asked if she believed that enhanced interrogation methods are effective, Haspel was equivocal.  “I don’t believe that torture works,” Haspel said. But the CIA obtained “valuable information” through its interrogations, she claimed. It is unknowable whether enhanced interrogation led to that information, she said, echoing a longstanding CIA defense of the program. Republicans on the Senate intelligence committee, meanwhile, said they were satisfied by Haspel’s responses about the CIA interrogation program, saying they’d received assurances from her in private that it was not moral. “I don’t think I got that from her at all,” Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) said when asked about Haspel’s dodging of the question. “I think she shares my view and everyone’s view up here that it is immoral.” Lawmakers also pushed Haspel on her role in destroying 92 videotapes that showed the CIA interrogating Abu Zubaydah, the agency’s first detainee. At the direction of her boss at the time, Jose Rodriguez, Haspel drafted a cable calling for the destruction of the tapes. Haspel said Wednesday that she supported Rodriguez’s decision because the tapes could have endangered the CIA officials who appeared in them if they’d leaked.  When Heinrich asked why the CIA did not preserve a digital copy of the tapes with the faces of the CIA officials blacked out, Haspel said she didn’t know. “I’m just not a technical person,” she said.  Ahead of Wednesday’s confirmation hearing, the CIA launched an unusually aggressive lobbying campaign on behalf of Haspel, pushing stories about her popularity within the agency and pointing out that she would be the first female CIA director.  Democratic lawmakers say the CIA selectively declassified information about the parts of her career that are flattering and withheld potentially damaging information. Haspel confirmed on Wednesday that she was involved in decisions about which parts of her record to declassify — but said she followed standard guidance.  While the CIA has highlighted the parts of her career that were unrelated to the interrogation program, the president has suggested that he chose her, in part, because of her role at the black sites.  The day before her confirmation hearing, Trump tweeted in support of Haspel, saying she “has been, and always will be, TOUGH ON TERROR!” Haspel received a boost after the hearing on Wednesday when Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a vulnerable red-state Democrat up for re-election this year, announced he would support her nomination to lead the CIA. This article has been updated to include Harris and Risch’s comments and to reflect Manchin’s announcement."
ARTS & CULTURE,"For some of us, the word ""playground"" conjures images of slides, swings, sand boxes and monkey bars. However, for kids living in the West Bank, recess looks very different from those attending school at a prep school in the United Kingdom, or in Sierra Leone.

POLITICS,"LOS ANGELES ― Millions of Americans have marijuana-related convictions on their criminal records — marks that can impair their ability to obtain jobs, housing and loans. But most Americans now believe pot should be legal, and about a quarter of Americans live in jurisdictions where it is. In some legal-weed states, legislators are passing bold new laws to address those past pot crimes. And some prosecutors are finally taking notice — and are looking to roll back outdated convictions.  In California, prosecutors in San Francisco and San Diego counties announced earlier this year they will review, recall, resentence and potentially dismiss and seal thousands of misdemeanor and felony marijuana convictions. The movement is spreading. On Friday, Seattle City Attorney Pete Holmes became the latest top prosecutor to join, asking a city court to vacate all convictions and dismiss all charges for misdemeanor marijuana possession that were prosecuted in the city before the state legalized marijuana for recreational purposes in 2012.  Now prosecutors in Denver and Burlington, Vt., are mulling similar measures, their representatives told HuffPost this week. In Denver, where prosecution of low-level pot offenses has been a low priority for a decade, Ken Lane, a spokesman for newly elected DA Beth McCann, said that while McCann hasn’t retroactively applied Colorado’s laws for post-conviction relief, “she has asked staff to research the matter... in response to what DAs in California are doing.” And in Vermont, which recently became the first state in the nation to legalize marijuana via legislature rather than ballot measure, another prosecutor is making moves. Justin Jiron, deputy state’s attorney in Chittenden County, Vermont, which contains Burlington, told HuffPost that his office is weeks away from announcing a new policy that will allow individuals to apply to have their past marijuana possession records expunged or sealed regardless of when the conviction took place. It’s not as immediate of a review as San Franciscans and San Diegans can expect, but it’s a meaningful step. “I think the simplest way of looking at it for us is just that these people have convictions that if they were to commit them today they wouldn’t be a crime,” Jiron said. “So it seems unfair to basically saddle them with a conviction for something that is now legal.”  Prosecutors in pot-friendly jurisdictions have enormous power to offer relief for people previously convicted of marijuana offenses in their jurisdiction, but many aren’t using it. California’s marijuana law requires individuals to apply for relief for previous marijuana-related crimes — a process that can be costly and time-consuming. Prosecutors there could greatly speed up the process by following San Francisco’s automatic process, which makes relief more immediate. Prosecutors in other legal-weed jurisdictions could potentially follow Seattle prosecutor Holmes’ lead and leverage their own state’s laws to move for post-conviction relief for past marijuana offenses. Those state laws, however, are complex and vary tremendously by jurisdiction ― this includes expungement, which does not have a standard definition across jurisdictions, as well as sealing and dismissal. Some states don’t address retroactive relief for past criminal convictions. Some require a governor’s pardon to vacate a conviction. Others allow post-conviction relief but require years-long wait periods, or limit which kinds of convictions can be removed from a person’s record.   But few prosecutors are making moves like Holmes’ — either because they don’t want to, or because state legislatures haven’t passed laws that allow relief for now-legal acts. People convicted of state pot crimes in the past in Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Colorado, Alaska, Vermont, Massachusetts and Maine — all places where the drug is now legal for recreational purposes — may still have violations on their record. And even in California, where the legal marijuana industry is already valued at $7 billion, according to one estimate. In Los Angeles County, California’s largest by population, District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced in February that individuals will have to continue to apply for relief themselves, “rather than wait for [her] office to go through tens of thousands of case files.” Lacey estimated there were 40,000 felony convictions involving marijuana since 1993 in Los Angeles County. When reached by HuffPost, her office did not have any updates on this decision. Prosecutors’ and legislators’ failure to wipe now-legal pot crimes from Americans’ records has real consequences, especially for people of color. Drug convictions, even for a misdemeanor offense like possession of marijuana, can have devastating consequences long after the offense was committed. The nation’s war on drugs has disproportionately harmed low-income and communities of color — blacks are nearly 4 times more likely to be arrested for possession of marijuana than whites, despite similar rates of use of the drug, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. “Laws and public opinion are evolving, but past convictions for marijuana-related offenses can still haunt someone,” said Mason Tvert, who works with VS Strategies, a Denver-based communications and government relations firm focused on marijuana policy. “It is great to see officials in some of the states that have legalized marijuana are proactively working to clear people’s records,” said the activist who was instrumental in the passage of Colorado’s recreational marijuana ballot measure. “But it does beg the question of why it is only occurring in some jurisdictions. Hopefully, we will see more local officials following the examples that are being set by the leaders in San Francisco and Seattle.” The exact extent to which prosecutors can retroactively apply their state marijuana laws or seek to vacate past convictions is a point of debate, and it depends on many complicated factors. This includes a prosecutors’ individual preferences, resources, a state’s laws regarding retroactivity and post-conviction relief, said Lauren-Brooke Eisen, a former prosecutor who is now a senior fellow at New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice. “There’s no one right answer to this,” Eisen said. “But what’s happening with marijuana in states like California and Colorado, which have built in some of this retroactivity, it does open the door absolutely for a little bit more pushing the envelope by DAs.” Some prosecutors can be hesitant about retroactive relief over concerns that a marijuana conviction may be just one of many charges that were once filed against a defendant, Eisen said. That’s because more than 90 percent of felony convictions at both the state and federal level are the result of plea bargains. If a defendant is facing multiple charges, the plea process allows for them to plead guilty to a lesser crime, while not facing a trial, and possible conviction, for the more serious charges. But charges that weren’t brought shouldn’t necessarily be held against a defendant, Eisen said.  “There’s an argument to be made that a defendant should get the benefit of that doubt,” she said. “Today, many prosecutors are working to repair damage from the war on drugs ... But more can be done.”  Rodney Holcombe, staff attorney at the Drug Policy Alliance echoed this sentiment, saying it is not enough to simply legalize marijuana because prohibition ravaged many communities. “Tens of thousands of people across the country – especially persons of color – continue to suffer from the consequences of prohibition,” he said. “We cannot in good conscience legalize without repairing the harms wrought by the failed drug war. We can only truly claim victory when we center our efforts on the persons most harmed by prohibition.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,"At the tail end of last year, the New York book community was hit with unsettling news. BookCourt, the independently run store serving Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Brooklyn Heights, and readers willing to venture from their own neighborhoods for the sake of author events and stocked shelves, was closing. For avid readers, the loss of a bookstore leaves a mark. Bookstores ― the brick-and-mortar variety ― foster so many chance encounters and reflective moments; true love of the glue-and-paper sort blossoms among their shelves. And, a shuttered indie doesn’t bode so well for the looming Bezospocalypse, even if their sales are increasing at a steadier-than-average clip compared with non-indie vendors.  But, like magic, the closing of BookCourt coincided with the announcement of another store, to be opened by Emma Straub, author of Modern Lovers, The Vacationers and Laura Lamont’s Life in Pictures. A onetime BookCourt employee and longtime lover of literature, Straub hopes her store will be “salve for the wound.” She and her husband are still ironing out the details of the lease for their store, Books Are Magic! But, she told The Huffington Post that they’re aiming for a May opening date. “I understand from all of my friends who own small businesses that things always take longer than you think they should,” Staub said. “But, we’ll see. The goal is May.” Below, Straub shares her earliest and happiest bookstore memories, and her and her husband’s plans for their future store. When did you decide to open Books Are Magic!? The second that we heard that BookCourt was closing. Which was mid-October. We found out earlier than most of the public in the neighborhood. Immediately, we thought, no, no, this can’t happen. We live a few blocks away from BookCourt, and we’re there, I would say, three or four times a week. I truly couldn’t fathom the notion that we would live in a neighborhood without an independent bookstore. We know ― oh, yeah, this is our job to fix. So, we’re working on it. In your announcement you highlight the importance of a bookstore to a community or neighborhood. How, in your experience, have bookstores played that role?  I work from home, and for me a bookstore is a place that I can always go. It’s a place I can go to find new ideas, and see old friends, and to read a poem, and to pick up a picture book for one of my children, and to buy a gift. Books are the only presents that always fit. I don’t think I’ve ever gotten a book and thought, oh, god, this is just, the wrong thing. Even when I don’t buy something, I always fondle a lot of things. As a writer, bookstores have been enormously important to me. BookCourt in particular, but also other independent bookstores across the country. There’s nothing like it. There’s nothing like a bookstore. It falls in a certain in-between space, between public space and private space. Bookstores always feel intimate but welcoming. I think they’re important and necessary for people like me who have small children, and where it’s not always warm outside. It’s nice to have a place to go. You’ve already touched on this, but what do you think physical bookstores offer that, say, an online bookstore doesn’t? Oh, discoverability. Discoverability, expertise. I think algorithms are great, and sometimes helpful when you’re buying something and it suggests that you also buy batteries or whatever, but it doesn’t really work with books. It really doesn’t. An algorithm is never going to replace a human being saying, “Oh, that’s interesting, you like Ann Patchett and Meg Wolitzer but you’ve never read Maile Meloy? Oh my god, you’re in for such a treat!” There are so many things like that that happen every day in every bookstore. Also, just the feeling of wandering. Actually, I have this problem a lot when it comes to music. I don’t listen to CDs anymore, because my husband is more technologically advanced than I am. He has his music very well organized, and on his cloud-whatever, but I no longer get to flip through my music to see what I have. I’ve forgotten what I like to listen to. I can’t remember anything if I can’t see it. And that’s how I feel about bookstores. When you walk through a bookstore, you’re reminded of things that you love, and you see a cover that looks amazing, of a book you’ve never heard of by a person you’ve never heard of, and you pick it up and you flip it over and you read what it’s about and maybe you buy it. And that doesn’t really happen online. You can’t just fall into something. You can’t pick a book off the shelf and read the first five pages of it and know that you’re going to fall in love. Or, you can’t pick up a book that everyone else has read and loved, and read the first page and know that it’s garbage and that you don’t want to read it. You worked at BookCourt. What do you hope to emulate about that store, with your store? And is there anything you’d like to change, or anything new you’d like to try? What’s most important to me is to have a space that feels open and welcoming, and comfortable. That’s the number-one thing. I think BookCourt did a really beautiful job for 35 years, and I hope to be half as good at it as they were. Luckily I have a lot of friends who run independent bookstores in New York City. In fact, everyone who runs a bookstore in New York City has been so friendly and encouraging to us about this. Christine Onorati, who owns WORD, is one of my dearest friends. Stephanie Valdez and Ezra at the Community Bookstore, Rebecca and Jessica at Greenlight, Maggie Pounzie at Story, a children’s bookstore. Sarah McNally. Every person has been encouraging, and offered their help and expertise. We really feel like we’re not trying to compete with anyone. We are truly just doing this to fill this hole in this neighborhood where we live, that has been served so beautifully by BookCourt for so long. We’re just trying to be a little salve for the wound.  Where did you come up with the store’s name, Books Are Magic!? We hadn’t really thought about names very much. We had a few that sounded more like a butcher shop. We were struggling a little bit. And then, we were talking about just doing a children’s bookstore. And I just thought, books are magic. Just, books are magic, that’s it, that’s the whole point. And we decided that books are magic for everyone, not just children. What’s your earliest bookstore memory? My earliest bookstore memory is from when I was about 10 years old, and I grew up on the Upper West Side in Manhattan where there used to be this wonderful independent bookstore called Endicot. And Matt Dillon was in the store when I was in the store, and I just followed him around. It was not a big place, and I was not a small 10-year-old, so I doubt I was very inconspicuous. So that’s my earliest bookstore memory, if I’m being 100 percent honest. So, it started with a dreamboat. Working at BookCourt was one of the best jobs I’ve ever had. I think what made it so fun for me was that I knew every day I went in there I was going to have conversations with smart, interesting people. That is, the other booksellers, the owners, and the customers. That’s what I really loved about it. There was always someone to talk to, and they always had something to say about a book.

ENTERTAINMENT,"The singer Halsey has been incredibly open with fans about her endometriosis diagnosis and her struggles with the disorder.   She said during an appearance on the TV show “The Doctors” on Thursday that she’s going to freeze her eggs, because of the fertility problems that can accompany endometriosis.  “When I tell people that, they’re like, ‘You’re 23, why do you need to do that? Why do you need to freeze your eggs?’” she said, explaining: “Doing an ovarian reserve is important to me because I’m fortunate enough to have that as an option, but I need to be aggressive about protecting my fertility, about protecting myself.”    Endometriosis is a complex disorder in which uterine tissue grows outside the uterus, which can cause inflammation, cysts and scarring. In addition to fertility problems, it can lead to severe pain during menstruation and sex.  The “Bad At Love” singer said it was difficult to finally get a diagnosis explaining why she had been in so much pain. It typically takes women an average of seven years to put a name to the disease.  “The thing with endometriosis is that it comes down to that doctors can tend to minimize the female experience when it comes to dealing with it,” Halsey said. “My whole life, my mother had always told me, ‘Women in our family just have really bad periods.’ It was just something she thought she was cursed to deal with and I was cursed to deal with, and that was just a part of my life.”  Halsey first revealed her endometriosis battle in January 2016, telling fans who also are experiencing the condition that she knows “how excruciatingly painful it can be and how discouraging the disease can be.” She underwent surgery in 2017.  A post shared by halsey (@iamhalsey) on Jan 6, 2017 at 6:21pm PST As she said on “The Doctors,” having a reproductive illness like endometriosis is sometimes “frustrating because it can really make you feel like less of a woman.”  “There’s a lot of times when you’re sitting at home and you just feel so terrible about yourself,” Halsey said. “You’re sick, you don’t feel sexy, you don’t feel proud, you don’t feel like there’s much hope.” She added “that hopefully I can have a bright future and achieve the things that I want to achieve by doing the ovarian reserve.” "
BUSINESS,"ESPN President and Disney Media Networks Co-Chairman John Skipper resigned Monday, citing a struggle with addiction. “Today I have resigned from my duties as President of ESPN,” Skipper said in a statement. “I have struggled for many years with a substance addiction,” he added. “I have decided that the most important thing I can do right now is to take care of my problem. “I come to this public disclosure with embarrassment, trepidation and a feeling of having let others I care about down. “To my colleagues at ESPN, it has been a privilege. I take great pride in your accomplishments and have complete confidence in your collective ability to continue ESPN’s success.” The move seems to have caught ESPN employees off guard. “Nobody knows anything,” an unidentified ESPN staffer told Sports Illustrated reporter Richard Deitsch. “There is a lot of reckless speculation out there.” Skipper had held the position since 2012 and earlier this year signed an extension to stay with the network through 2021. The network has struggled financially of late. In April, it laid off 100 employees, many of whom were well-known names among ESPN’s on-air talent. It’s also struggled to navigate the increasingly more political aspects of sports, taking on criticism in October when it temporarily suspended “SportsCenter” host Jemele Hill after she shared her political opinions on social media. Hill took to Twitter Monday to express her admiration for Skipper and thank him for his support. This story has been updated with additional details about the network."

ENTERTAINMENT,"Mark Hamill may have just let the cat out of the bag on a major “Star Wars” actor appearing in the upcoming Han Solo film, “Solo: A Star Wars Story.”  “Tony Daniels is so happy ’cause he’s in every single ‘Star Wars’ movie. Every single one. All the prequels. He’s in ‘Rogue One,’ He’s in ‘Solo,’” Hamill told the Washington Post’s Cape Up podcast. “Whoops! I hope that’s not... ”  Whoops, indeed.  Hamill was referring to Anthony Daniels, the actor who portrays the iconic droid C-3PO. As Hamill noted, Daniels has appeared in every “Star Wars” movie to date, but his possible role in “Solo” had never been made public.  “That’s not such a reveal,” Hamill said, perhaps in an attempt at intergalactic damage control. “All ‘Star Wars’ fans expect him to be in every movie.” Well, they do now.  Hamill’s comments come at a little after the 1:19:00 mark:  Hamill didn’t specifically mention that Daniels would be playing C-3PO in “Solo” so there’s always a chance he could take on a different role. It wouldn’t be the first time. While Daniels appeared in “Episode II: Attack of the Clones” as C-3PO, he also had a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it role as a human character in the film’s club scene.  “Solo: A Star Wars Story” opens on May 25.  (h/t Uproxx)"
ARTS & CULTURE,"I couldn't wait to see San Francisco Ballet's latest offering of Romeo and Juliet. As with most companies, SF Ballet artistic director Helgi Tomasson alternates the casting of the principal parts among several dancers, and I was looking forward to seeing Maria Kochetkova and Davit Karapetyan in the leads, as well as the incomparable Pascal Molat in the demanding role of Mercutio. But this is such a fine, deep company -- at the first intermission, talking with my friend Jay Gilman, I said, ""I would gladly come back to see the other casts."" Jay said, ""I would gladly come back to see this cast."" When a company's principal dancers and soloists are this excellent, your choice of casts often comes down to those whose acting ability or personal style/charisma grabs you. My all-time favorite Romeo will have to be Yuri Possokhov, now the company's choreographer in residence. Trained in Moscow and a member of the Bolshoi and Royal Danish Ballets before he came to San Francisco, he had magnificent dancing and acting skills, plus, frankly, major sex appeal. (Please don't think me shallow; I mean -- Romeo.) When I saw him dance his last Romeo, in tears at the end, I looked over at my friend, Ivory, who burst out, ""Does he know I'm single?!"" To tell the truth, I can't remember who danced Juliet that evening. This year, tiny, doll-faced Kochetkova, who is a wonderfully proficient ballerina, danced Juliet so girlishly at first, more Clara in Nutcracker, I wondered how she would handle the transition to sudden love and lust for Romeo. She did, of course, starting with her frank interest in the masked Romeo at her father's ball. By the time she and the handsome Karapetyan performed their gorgeous pas de deux, with all those airy, sensual lifts, in the balcony scene, it was sexual awakening before your very eyes, so to speak. Meantime, you knew the tall and manly Karapetyan, an older ladies man of a Romeo from his flirting with another in the first act, had fallen in love with Juliet's lovely, innocent charm. With its sex and violence, Romeo and Juliet is truly a classic ballet crowd pleaser, at least when done right. To break your heart, it really needs dancers who are adept at physical acting, too -- dancers who can go beyond the surface of the story's emotions and embody a notion of the characters. You want to feel their lust and love, anger and heartbreak, bone-deep pain over separation and (what seems, then is) death. Similarly, all that swordplay between Montagues and Capulets -- particularly between the Capulet hothead Tybalt and Romeo's beloved friend Mercutio, followed by Romeo himself -- should have the audience tense. So thank goodness Tomasson, who choreographed this version of R&J, enlisted actor, teacher, and fight expert Martino Pistone to help develop the ""fight-scene choreography"" and, each time SF Ballet performs this ballet, to train the male dancers in handling those weapons. Set in the Italian Renaissance -- hence all those gorgeous velvets and brocades, flowing sleeves and intricate soft caps -- this production uses weapons of the period: rapiers (long swords with double-edged blades) and daggers. Each cast's Romeo, Tybalt and Mercutio practice together, of course; and if there's a last-minute cast change, Tomasson says it's nerve-inducing because each duo's timing is a bit different. While ballet versions of Shakespeare's inimitable 1597 play have existed since the late 1700s, most productions now are set to the full-length score composed by Sergey Prokofiev in 1935, which certainly encourages an audience's swooning and fear. At the same time, the musical passage during Mercutio's death scene causes it to go on far too long. Though Molat perfectly expressed in movement and mime everything from braggadocio, to careless-seeming flirting, to faltering life, you can never feel the emotions you should when among them is a trace of impatience. Even Romeo's anguish at finding Juliet ""dead"" was overacted and overlong, which kept me from crying my usual buckets of tears. (Only Paris, the wealthy suitor whom Juliet's parents were forcing her to marry, was dispatched quickly, there in the tomb.) But then Juliet awoke and discovered her Romeo, got up the nerve to stab herself, and crept over to die beside him. When, not yet quite dead, he weakly lifted and dropped his arm over her, my evening was complete. While this is the last program of the season (and let's hope SF Ballet brings this beautiful tale of woe back again soon), the company will be performing four short ballets in the city's Stern Grove Festival, for free, this summer. May 9, matinees May 9 and 10: San Francisco Ballet, War Memorial Opera House, 301 Van Ness Ave., S.F.; July 26: short ballets, Stern Grove, 415.865.2000."
POLITICS,"Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt was granted around-the-clock security starting his first day on the job after he personally requested it, new documents reveal. EPA Inspector General Arthur Elkins said in a letter to senators on Monday that Pruitt requested 24/7 protection “once he was confirmed as Administrator.” Don Benton, then a senior White House adviser supervising the EPA, also asked for around-the-clock security for Pruitt for at least his first week on the job, according to emails obtained by The Washington Post. “There will be several Executive Orders signed when [Pruitt] is sworn in that will likely stir the hornets nest and with the security issue in the Atlanta office last week as well as the lady who threatened former administrator [Gina] McCarthy not showing up for court and at large in DC it is best to be on the safe side,” Benton wrote on Feb. 12, 2017.  The EPA in the past has justified Pruitt’s security expenses as necessary because of a sharp uptick in threats against him, including what a spokesman referred to as “an unprecedented amount of death threats.” Pruitt reportedly was “approached at the airport numerous times, to the point of profanities being yelled at him.” The agency hadn’t before revealed that Pruitt’s extensive security began his first day on the job.  Pruitt’s enhanced security detail, three times the size of his predecessor, has cost taxpayers almost $3 million, The Associated Press reported last month. The hefty price, along with Pruitt’s lavish spending on worldwide travel and his ethical lapses, have kept him under a cloud of controversy.  Although President Donald Trump has come to Pruitt’s defense amid calls for his ouster, the White House admitted for the first time last week that the ethical issues have “raised some concerns.”"
POLITICS,"Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) said it’s a “perpetual gut punch” to hear reports that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) now regrets picking her as his 2008 presidential running mate. Palin, in an interview with The Daily Mail published Thursday, said McCain has never expressed any misgivings to her. The ailing senator reportedly makes the admission in his upcoming book and in an HBO documentary, The New York Times reported. “That’s not what Sen. McCain has told me all these years, as he’s apologized to me repeatedly for the people who ran his campaign –- some who now staff MSNBC, the newsroom there, which tells you a lot,” Palin said. She attributed McCain’s statements to his ghostwriters.  “It happens to me also where people speak for me and a bell is rung, and you can’t un-ring the bell,” she said. “I don’t know unless I heard it from Sen. McCain myself.” She added that hearing the claim feels “like a perpetual gut-punch.”  McCain reportedly writes in his book that he planned to choose Joe Lieberman, then an independent senator from Connecticut, as his running mate, but advisers counseled him against it because of Lieberman’s past as a Democrat.  McCain, 81, is ailing from brain cancer and has been reflecting on his career and the state of politics. He reportedly asked that President Donald Trump not attend his funeral and has implored former Vice President Joe Biden to not quit politics. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Well, having art and culture sure was cool while it lasted! President-elect Donald Trump plans to dramatically slash funding for the humanities when he takes office, according to a new report from The Hill. In meetings with White House staff, Trump transition officials have reportedly indicated that the administration will shutter the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, as well as privatize the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The Hill report notes that the floated budget cuts “hew closely to a blueprint published last year by the conservative Heritage Foundation.” It’s previously been reported that the think tank has been enormously influential in shaping Trump’s nascent administration. In the “Blueprint for Balance: A Federal Budget for 2017,” the Foundation devotes one page each to the eliminations of the NEA and the NEH, which is more than enough to paint a chilling picture for supporters of public arts funding. In its argument for closing the NEH, the Heritage blueprint proclaims, “government should not use its coercive power of taxation to compel taxpayers to support cultural organizations and activities.” On a similar note, it states of the NEA, “Taxpayer assistance of the arts is neither necessary nor prudent [...] Taxpayers should not be forced to pay for plays, paintings, pageants, and scholarly journals, regardless of the works’ attraction or merit.” Reached via email, both the NEA and the NEH declined to comment specifically on the report. “We’re not speculating on what policies the president-elect (or the Congress) may or may not choose to pursue,” Victoria Hutter, assistant director of public affairs at the NEA, told HuffPost. “We are not going to speculate on the policies or priorities of the new Administration,” NEH spokeswoman Theola DeBose reiterated. The act forming the NEA and the NEH was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965, in response to a movement to restore due attention and emphasis to the arts in an age driven by scientific innovation and exploration ― an imbalance that hasn’t gone away, as universities today focus on STEM and slash humanities funding. Though the Heritage Foundation blueprint argues that the endowments can and should be replaced by philanthropy, the NEA and NEH serve a unique purpose. Relying solely on individual arts giving and spending can leave humanities institutions and creatives at the whims of the super-wealthy ― think Trump’s foundation purchasing a portrait of the man himself for thousands of dollars, or, more typically, a moneyed New Yorker donating millions to her favorite opera house ― but the NEA and NEH take on initiatives in partnership with state and local organizations to shore up arts and humanities access in underserved communities. Government grants are offered to cultural institutions and individuals who submit outstanding proposals that hold up to objective vetting and review. The NEH has supported the creation of 16 Pulitzer Prize-winning books and Ken Burns’ iconic documentary “The Civil War.” The NEA also helped get the Sundance Film Festival off the ground. In a statement responding to the report, literary human rights organization PEN America denounced the alleged proposed cuts as a sign of a “new Dark Ages,” arguing: “The announcement that this is even under consideration casts a sinister cloud over our vibrant national culture.” Of course, shutting down the NEA and NEH isn’t as simple as a presidential decree issued on Jan. 21. As writer Celeste Pewter pointed out in an extensive Twitter thread, any proposed cuts to various government agencies would depend on Congressional budgets and appropriation: 2) DT can't just wave his arms and go: Ok, this is our budget for the next four year! Bam! Key point from the story. pic.twitter.com/bo5dh0qZRs Much as floods of phone calls from constituents resulted in GOP lawmakers backing down from a secretive push to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics earlier this month, voters opposed to the drastic cuts reported by The Hill can make supporting those budgetary changes deeply uncomfortable for their representatives. For those worried about a possible impending “Dark Ages” of the humanities, repeatedly calling congressional representatives to vocally oppose shuttering the NEA and NEH is a clear and practical next step: It could help save them.  Given Trump’s previously documented lack of interest in books and art that aren’t about himself ― as well as the Heritage Foundation’s power in his transition ― this latest report shouldn’t come as too much of a shock. But the drastic nature of the proposed cuts is nonetheless unsettling, and on the eve of the inauguration, offers a grim vision of what art and culture could face in Trump’s America if the people don’t fight hard to protect them."
ARTS & CULTURE,"It's not that easy for a person to disappear. In today's heavily connected world, it may be possible for someone to go off the grid or take an electronic sabbatical. But if an emergency arises (or someone files a missing person report), chances are pretty good he'll be found. Unless, of course, something terrible has happened. Whenever someone goes missing, there's always a backstory which can explain their disappearance. How a writer will use that event to craft a novel, a stage drama, a screenplay, or an operatic libretto remains to be seen. Of course, that's assuming that the missing person's remains will ever be seen!			 Two missing person mysteries recently took center stage in San Francisco. One was a contemporary drama making its debut as part of the National New Play Network's Rolling World Premiere program (with future productions scheduled at the Cleveland Public Theatre and the Mo'olelo Performing Arts Company in San Diego). The other was a notorious musical comedy flop that was pronounced dead on arrival after its opening night on December 8, 1991. The theatre critic for The New York Times (Frank Rich) ended his review by stating that ""We can look forward to hearing a lot more from Ms. Prince. In the meantime, there is no escaping the unfortunate fact that the liveliest thing in Nick and Nora is a corpse."" Potential ticket buyers quickly said ""Asta la vista!"" * * * * * * * * * * Directed by Giovanna Sardelli, the San Francisco Playhouse presented the world premiere of In A Word (a new play by Lauren Yee) as part of its Sandbox Series. As Yee explains: ""In this play, objects have a life of their own. Objects come up again whether you want them to or not. Words also come up again, and sometimes the characters realize this or not. Time is very fluid.""  Jessica Bates as Fiona in a scene from In A Word (Photo by: Fei Cai)   The action focuses on a couple marking the two-year anniversary of their young son's disappearance. Nothing seems to make sense to the mother, Fiona (Jessica Bates), who is still clutching at straws. With the case about to be closed by the local police, Fiona has even thought it could be helpful to present the detective from the missing persons bureau with a cantaloupe that might have recently had the kidnapper's fingerprints on it. Needless to say, he's more interested in eating the cantaloupe. Fiona's husband, Guy (Cassidy Brown), is trying to get Fiona out the door so they can at least enjoy dinner at a fancy restaurant and start to rebuild their lives. But with his wife's ongoing depression, distraction, and lack of logic, dinner seems a long way off.  Jessica Bates and Cassidy Brown in a scene from In A Word
(Photo by: Fei Cai)  The third (and, by far, most interesting) actor (Greg Ayers) keeps popping up as part of a game of Whac-a-Mole that is playing out in Fiona's mind. At any given moment he might be the photographer who snapped her son's school portrait, the principal (who was also her boss), or the kidnapper who stole her son while her car was parked at a gas station. He could also be the detective working the case, her husband's best friend, or her missing seven-year-old boy, Tristan (who might have Asperger syndrome).
 Jessica Bates and Greg Ayers in a scene from In A Word
(Photo by: Fei Cai)  Despite its relatively short running time (80 minutes), it takes a while for Yee's play to gain momentum as the audience tries to follow what's going on in Fiona's extremely cluttered and confused mind. As a result, a great deal of attention is siphoned off to the actor inhabiting multiple roles, whose versatility at times may seem far more interesting than Yee's script. Thankfully, Yee steers the story to a touching resolution. Working on a unit set designed by Catalina Nino, Sardelli's three-actor ensemble did a fine job of bringing Yee's script to life. Unfortunately, I still can't figure out the symbolism of the tree which haunts Fiona and Guy's home. * * * * * * * * * * Nearly 25 years have passed since Nick & Nora (a musical written and directed by Arthur Laurents with music by Charles Strouse and lyrics by Richard Maltby, Jr.) met a sudden demise on the Great White Way. Based on characters created by Dashiell Hammett for The Thin Man (and with a cast headed by Joanna Gleason, Barry Bostwick, Christine Baranski, Faith Prince, Debra Monk, Remak Ramsay, and Chris Sarandon), the show would seem to have been blessed with many tried and tested Broadway talents. To understand what went wrong, perhaps it's best to follow the money. Nick & Nora was apparently underfunded and, in a misguided effort to save money, the producers decided against an out-of-town tryout (opting instead to run the show through 71 preview performances). Without the perverse appeal of a vehicle like Spider-Man: Turn Off The Dark (which racked up 182 preview performances prior to its opening), the money needed for marketing during Christmas season ran out. Faced with fierce competition for entertainment dollars (and having exhausted advance ticket sales from theatre parties), the producers would have been hard pressed to fill the cavernous 1,611-seat Marquis Theatre during the holidays. With the traditional January box office doldrums on the horizon, a mercy killing was the obvious solution. San Francisco's 42nd Street Moon (which specializes in re-examining ""lost"" musicals) recently revived Nick & Nora in a production directed by Greg MacKellan, with choreography by Staci Arriaga. While the show is nowhere as bad as some of the Broadway stinkers I've seen (Something More! Maggie Flynn, Georgy, Her First Roman, I Had A Ball), it's a weak and fairly mediocre vehicle that lacks the musicality of Jennie, the sophistication of No Strings, or the sentimentality of Here's Love!  Even Bajour was more exciting.   Nora (Brittany Danielle) and Nick (Ryan Drummond) are asked
by Tracy (Allison Rich) to investigate a murder in Nick & Nora
(Photo by: David Allen)   With Dave Dobrusky as music director (and sets and costumes by Hector Zavala), 42nd Street Moon's cast handled the material with aplomb, enabling the crooked bookkeeper, Lorraine Bixby (Nicole Frydman), to rise from the dead (an especially nifty trick for an Easter Sunday matinee) on numerous occasions in an effort to explain why a wealthy, bitchy actress's husband had gone missing. As the famous Nick and Nora Charles, Ryan Drummond and Britanny Danielle were a visually appealing couple (although I doubt the audience cared very much about their relationship or Nora's determination to prove herself as a female detective). Allison Rich scored strongly as the narcissistic Tracy Gardner whose Japanese butler, Yukido (Reuben Uy), proved to be the loyal villain. Megan Stetson drew laughs as Lorraine's lesbian girlfriend, Maria Valdez, who was hoping to break into motion pictures. Justin Gillman (Spider Malloy), Brian Herndon (film director Max Bernheim), William Giammona (as a social-climbing former felon), and Michael Barrett Austin (as Lieutenant Wolfe, with an ""e"") provided sturdy support in smaller roles. Michael Kern Cassidy (as the missing Hollywood producer, Edward J. Connors) and Cindy Goldfield (as his overprotective wife, Lily) brought an added touch of Boston flavor to the proceedings.  Brittany Danielle (Nora Charles), Ryan Drummond (Nick Charles),
Allison Rich (Tracy Gardner), and Nicole Frydman (Lorraine Bixby)
appear in Nick & Nora (Photo by: David Allen)  42nd Street's production of Nick & Nora proves that the show is far from a total dud. It's reasonably entertaining and features some pleasant songs (""Is There Anything Better Than Dancing?"" ""Everybody Wants To Do A Musical,"" ""People Get Hurt,"" ""Men,"" and ""Look Who's Alone Now""). One of the show's bigger problems is that the crucial relationship between Nick and Nora doesn't seem to generate much interest or sympathy (primarily serving as an excuse for the rest of the script's hijinks). Thankfully, Arthur Laurents (a veteran of Hollywood and Broadway) peppered his script with some zingers. To read more of George Heymont go to My Cultural Landscape"
ARTS & CULTURE,"President Donald Trump’s tweets might be polluting the natural environment that is your mind, but they’re finding greater purpose somewhere: specifically, in a subterranean lavender field in New York City. Austrian artist Martin Roth, now based in NYC, is the mad gardener behind an idyllic new art exhibition, which happens to be powered in part by Trump’s 140-character declarations. Nestled inside the Austrian Cultural Forum of Midtown Manhattan, it consists of 200 lavender shrubs that are nurtured by grow lights whose power corresponds with the activities of several social media accounts. That’s right, the strength of the bulbs depends on how frequently accounts like @POTUS, @realDonaldTrump, @PressSec and @KellyannePolls issue a tweet. (Other connected accounts: @foxandfriends, @seanhannity, @tuckercarlson, @breitbartnews, @heritage, @CNN and @washingtonpost.) Motivated by the “heightened anxiety” many have felt in the wake of Trump’s election, the arrangement is meant to turn the chaos of our present political reality into something capable of assuaging our collective terror. “The pace and tenor of the current political discourse, blasted out through social media 24/7 without respite, affects our psyche in a profound way,” Martin told Mashable. “I’m interested in Twitter because it seemed to be the only news getting through. It’s fast and used as a political weapon, but ... it seems overall just to be there to distract us.” Using eight tons of soil, six rows of lavender and a soothing backdrop of nature-adorned wallpaper, Martin has created what appears at first to be place of refuge, a fragrance-filled spot where art lovers can stop to, quite literally, smell the flowers. However, they can’t do so without wondering just how many tweets are flying through the digital ether at any given moment. If the lavender is thriving, so too are POTUS and co.’s statuses. The effect, Hyperallergic’s Claire Voon notes, is amplified by “the windowless, concrete space,” which she describes as “claustrophobic.” Even when the air smells like perfume, something capable of transcending the underground sanctuary is probably amiss ― you just can’t see it. “The total effect is less an immersion into the woods, and more a sojourn in a doomsday bunker of the One-Percent,” Kate Sutton wrote in an essay that appears on the Forum’s website. “Any calm this environment induces is innately tinged by suspicion of its circumstances.” You can visit the not-so-subtle installation until June 21."
POLITICS,"Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) is a longtime investor in a winery that was sued in 2016 for auctioning off a yacht party that allegedly involved cocaine and prostitutes, The Fresno Bee reported.  Alene Anase, a former employee of Alpha Omega Winery, said the company had auctioned a 2015 cruise aboard its yacht for charity. Anase was asked to serve the 25 winning bidders, who were all men, according to court documents the Bee posted online. No owners or investors were on the cruise, the winery told the Bee.  According to the lawsuit: “Plaintiff realized that the men had brought prostitutes, hard liquor, and what appeared to be cocaine onto the Yacht. Plaintiff was extremely disturbed by the presence of the prostitutes, especially because it appeared that some of the girls were too young to consent to sexual activity.” Anase’s lawsuit was eventually settled for an undisclosed amount, according to the Bee. The suit included six allegations, including sexual harassment, emotional distress and retaliation. The men aboard the yacht “consumed large quantities of alcohol and a white substance Plaintiff understood to be cocaine,” the suit alleged, saying that at least one of the men approached Anase for sexual services and stated that she feared being sexually assaulted.  According to the lawsuit, when Anase complained, the company’s marketing director allegedly ordered her to “‘lie low’ and try to do as little as possible in order to avoid harassment.” The suit also claimed that Anase received counseling for psychological trauma, took medication for anxiety and depression, and suffered from panic and sleep problems, all as a result of the cruise. Wine Business reported on the lawsuit in 2016 and said Alpha Omega Winery had continued to auction cruises for charity after the incident.  “We refined our policies for the charitable donation of the yacht immediately upon learning of the incident and before a lawsuit was filed,” winery spokeswoman Kelly Carter told the website at the time.  Robin Baggett, whom the Bee describes as a friend of Nunes, owns Alpha Omega Winery. It’s not clear how big of a stake Nunes has in the business, but the Bee reported that he is one of at least 50 investors, investing between $50,000 and $100,000 after selling his dairy farm in 2006 and earning between $2,501 and $5,000 from his investment in 2016.  The House Intelligence Committee chairman has not spoken much about the winery publicly over the years. However, when Time asked in 2010 what he would be doing if he wasn’t in politics, he said, “I’d be making wine and cheese.”  He did not comment on the yacht allegations, according to the Bee.  The Los Angeles Times said Nunes has three main assets: stakes in two wineries (Phase 2 Cellars and Alpha Omega Winery LLC) and a Bank of America savings account. The three are worth a combined $101,000, the outlet noted. "
ENTERTAINMENT,"Some members of the audience at a “Scarface” reunion in New York Thursday were angered by a question about Michelle Pfeiffer’s weight. Saying he was a parent concerned about body image, Tribeca Film Festival moderator Jesse Kornbluth asked Pfeiffer how much she weighed in the violent cult classic, according to multiple outlets. One audience member shouted, “Why do you want to know?!” Another yelled, “Seriously?” and audible boos followed. Kornbluth tried to regain his footing by saying, “This is not the question you think it is.” Pfeiffer, who portrayed the wife of trigger-happy drug lord Tony Montana (Al Pacino), explained that she was playing a cocaine addict, so she was accelerating her weight loss to fit the story. “Of course, I tried to time it so that as the movie went on I became thinner and thinner and more emaciated,” she said. At the end of the shoot, she added, ” I think I was living on tomato soup and Marlboros.” Pound for pound, this had to be the most awkward moment of the night. Pfeiffer and “Scarface” stars Al Pacino and Steven Bauer, along with director Brian De Palma, had gathered for a 35th-anniversary screening of the movie."
ARTS & CULTURE," Haegue Yang, Courtesy the artist. At Haegue Yang's exhibition at the Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art in Seoul, ""Shooting the Elephant 象 Thinking the Elephant,"" the visitor will encounter installations and sculptures composed of bright brass bells, electric fans, light bulbs, and Venetian blinds, all involved in a dance of movement, light, texture, and sound. At the start of the exhibition, visitors are invited to don garlands of bells, wearable sculptures the artist calls Sonicwears (2013/2015). In one installation, different scents are emitted periodically into the air. Based on these works alone, one could be forgiven for thinking that Yang's work is primarily concerned with the senses: sight, sound, smell, and touch. But this is just one layer of Yang's work, a surface reading, and while no less true, of course, and no less satisfying, a deeper plunge into the work and its references and dialogues reveals a vast ocean of meaning underneath.  Haegue Yang, Shooting the Elephant 象 Thinking the Elephant, installation view. Courtesy Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art. ""Shooting the Elephant 象 Thinking the Elephant,"" on view until May 10, is Haegue Yang's first solo exhibition in her native country of South Korea in five years. Based in Berlin, Yang is perhaps best known for her installations comprised of arrangements of Venetian blinds--a sculptural motif she introduced in a work entitled Series of Vulnerable Arrangements - Blind Room at the São Paulo Bienal in 2006, and continued to use in installations at the Venice Biennale (where she represented South Korea in 2009), dOCUMENTA (13), and numerous other commissions for major art institutions like Haus der Kunst and the Walker Art Center. Venetian blinds--with their binary properties of folding/unfolding, and transparency/privacy--provide a rich visual and sculptural framework, as well as an apt metaphor, for many of the themes Yang is interested in exploring, including issues of barriers, borders, and dispersion.

Courtesy Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art and Greene Naftali, New York. An astute observer of Yang's work in this exhibition will note the overwhelming prevalence of everyday materials--metal stands mounted on casters, like one might encounter in office furniture or clothing racks, umbrellas, artificial plants, cell phone charms, light bulbs, kitchenware, envelopes, chairs and tables--and note how each element reaches for cultural referents to individuality or community life. A group of light sculptures entitled Seoul Guts (2010) loiters in a corner of The Leeum's expansive gallery, each one an intuitive assemblage of everyday materials draped across a mobile garment rack, standing at about the height of an average person; like a person, each sculpture betrays its individual eccentricities, carries itself in a particular way, and seems to hold on to these personal affects as extensions of themselves. VIP's Union (2001/2015), on the other hand, is comprised of borrowed furniture, serving as an artwork and a rest area for visitors to the museum; the oddly matched tables and chairs, lent by local residents and workers of Seoul, form loose groups and alliances within the space, visually approximating the concept of a community.  Haegue Yang, VIP's Union, 2001/2015. Courtesy the artist. Citadella (2011), an installation composed of 186 Venetian blinds suspended in a labyrinthine arrangement of corridors and rooms, invites comparisons to a village or town, albeit a rather mysterious and dark one. It's here that visitors are misted with scents (artificially composed and branded with comfortable, natural names: Mountain Mist, Ocean, Fresh Cut Grass, Rainforest, etc.), while moving spotlights send roving shadows through the slats of the blinds. A video essay projected within the installation, Doubles and Halves - Events with Nameless Neighbors (2009)--documenting poor residents of Ahyun-dong, Seoul, where the artist lived for a time, and homeless people staying in the Biennale park of Venice in the off-season--provides ghost-like inhabitants for the Venetian-blind passageways.  Haegue Yang, Cittadella, 2011. Courtesy of Kukje Gallery, Seoul. Yang's grandest sculptural gestures in The Leeum's Jean Nouvel-designed space are manifested in three towering straw edifices, modeled after a Mayan pyramid, the Indonesian ruin of Borobudur, and the Russian Islamic mosque Lala Tulpan. Collectively titled The Intermediates (2015), a body of work devised specifically for this exhibition, the sculptures pose in an in-between state, between scale model and real building, between the ephemeral and the everlasting, between the natural and the artificial. The figure statues placed between the structures resemble raffia-wrapped shamans--intermediaries between the human and the spirit world, between civilization and nature. The material of straw was chosen because of its ""universality""--in nearly every culture, no matter its geographic location or time period, straw appears as a familiar folk material--but here the straw is all artificial, made of a filmy, flaxen-colored plastic, thwarting any kind of nostalgic sentiment for a shared, primitive past.  Haegue Yang, The Intermediate - Lion Dance on One Leg (left), 2015; The Intermediate - After Borobudur (right), 2015. Courtesy the artist. Lest one imagines Yang's work casts its eyes only on the ancient past and our everyday present, references to art history also come into sight. At the entrance of the museum, suspended high above the viewer, a new work, a modular Venetian-blind structure, invokes Sol Lewitt by reproducing one of his iconic sculptures of repeating cubic forms, enlarged and hung upside down. And Boxing Ballet (2013/2015) replicates the historic, geometric costumes of the Triadic Ballet by Bauhaus painter, sculptor, and choreographer Oskar Schlemmer, their distinctive forms covered by gold bells.  Haegue Yang, Sol LeWitt Upside Down - Structure with Three Towers, Expanded 23 Times, 2015. Courtesy the artist. But where is the eponymous elephant? Nowhere in Yang's exhibition will you find any visual indicator of the great grey beast. Yang's elephant, rather, is literary, drawn from two written works: ""Shooting an Elephant,"" an essay by George Orwell, and The Roots of Heaven (Les Racines du Ciel), a novel by Romain Gary. In both stories, the elephant serves as a metaphor for nature, and humans find themselves in confrontation with it. Both stories, notably, are entwined in the ugly circumstances of colonialism. This virtual ""elephant in the room"" points to another, very important, undercurrent of Yang's work: her ""interest in how colonial history affects and transforms us.""  Haegue Yang, Boxing Ballet, 2013/2015. Courtesy the artist. Yang's installations and sculptures, in their formal qualities, their materials, and their cultural references, echo the vast human sensorium, intellect, and capacity to create. Whether or not the visitor can catch all the references and underlying meanings to the works, however, is not necessarily of importance to the artist. In a recent interview in Ocula, the artist explains, ""My driving interests and motivations are often concrete, but my artistic language is one of abstraction. Abstraction is, for me, a way of thinking and working through collective and individual narratives across different histories, generations and locations. They coincide and overlap, becoming comprehensible on a personal level in linguistically unexplainable ways."" Understanding Yang's work and its myriad references and allusions, then, is not the crucial factor--it's the experience that truly matters. In the end, Yang's work is primarily concerned with expressing what it means to be human, the nuances of which are infinitely varied and discrete.  Haegue Yang, Cittadella, 2011.

ARTS & CULTURE,"The String Quartet was initiated by Joseph Haydn. His pieces were written for, and performed by, the educated amateur, often an aristocrat and his friends and family. It was parlor music in the best sense of that phrase. Mozart joined in the fun, and then Beethoven pushed the medium into the professional realm when his works were finally written for a group of professional musicians.  Since then the genre has been one of great attraction to composers, not only because of the presence of many established quartets, but also because of the nature of the medium itself.  The composition of the group-four string instruments from highest to low- allows a composer to engage in the art of musical conversation without the distraction of color. It is thus a fecund environment in which to work out ideas. This has been true in the early part of last century with the creation of the bodies of quartets of Bartok and Shostakovich, as theirs is a rich addition and extension of the repertoire.  It is no less true of the latter half of the twentieth century, and in the following I recommend a few works I think worthy of your attention.  Stephen Albert, upon hearing that I was writing string quartets, asked how I had the temerity to do so considering the overbearing presence of Bartok's. My response was ""Well, how can you write symphonies after Beethoven and Mahler, or songs after Schubert."" The answer of course is that you just do. I should have also said, ""Why don't you ask your teacher and mentor, George Rochberg?"", who wrote seven of them. Maybe it is time to go back and listen to these, particularly from the third onwards, as this period, the 70's, and these works, mark his break from serialism and his turn to neo-romanticism. They are passionate and playful, as if the composer had found a wonderous new/old playground in which to write. In many respects, they are the pioneering foundation for the quartets of the following composers. George Tsontakis has written six string quartets, the last two recently commissioned and performed by one of my favorite ensembles, The Cypress Quartet.  I look forward to hearing these.  Even if he doesn't write another, his contribution to the genre has been already been huge. I find his intimate music among his best, and that is so with these quartets. In the third and fourth, he shows a suave sense of melody and his harmonic language is personal and true. The fourth is, it must be said at the outset, a work of religious substance. The text of the hymn is the works title, ""Beneath Thy Tenderness of Heart"".  The first movement quotes the hymn and then weaves subtle variations upon it.  The movement does indeed express tenderness, not a quality that is found all that much in 20th century history.  It also displays qualities of affirmation and even purity of spirit, and this is found in its unabashed, and very well handled, mostly tonal universe.  Movement II, marked Scherzo, is less about a joke than about the joyousness of speed and a quick darting free abandon. Yet there are indeed sudden shifts of dynamics and register, and even an obsessiveness of motivic repetition, that provide a droll humor or a slightly charming perversity. Movement III, marked Postlude, The Madonna Weeps, has long sections that start with a smashed major chord, followed by dissolution into an ambiguous atonal world, marked by clear and articulated chords changing ever so slowly. Above those chords a very high violin softly wails, and then at the phrases' conclusions, trails off into the stratosphere. Through the repetition of this phraseology, time seems to cycle back upon itself, containing the state of transcendent despair.   Donald Wheelock wrote his third and fourth quartets in 1988 and 1992 respectively. In the Ciompi Quartet's empathetic performances of twenty years ago they are revealed as impassioned conversations displaying more of this composer's emotional landscape than he usually reveals. They are finely textured, impassioned, and structurally solid. Here his contrapuntal proclivity comes alive, and there is a pervasive sense of dynamism. The music is intense and emotionally gripping. While sometimes spikey, it is not overly so. The fourth, in one movement, is a tour de force. It combines simplicity and complexity in equal measure, moments of severe intensity followed by lush quiescence, rhythmic vibrancy and placid, cantabile melodies. After a long and chaotic journey, it ends quickly and quietly, like a puff of smoke disappearing. All of this takes place within a harmonic field of wide inclusiveness, yet tonally grounded, always focused and sharply heard. Robert Xavier Rodriguez's Meta 4 (1994) was written for the dance, but it does just fine as an independent concert piece. The title is a nice word play on the pervasive presence of things ""4"" in the piece: four players, for movements, a theme of four notes... you get the idea. The first movement- soliloquy and cannon- starts with a tender melody played in unison that is characterized by wide expressive leaps, a reappearing ornamental figure, mostly placed in a high tessitura that is sometimes searing. The canon is more steady, full and luxuriant, at the end effervescing and leaving hardly a trace. The second movement scherzo- in measures of two beats rather than the usual three- is made up of short pizzicato and motivic bursts, as well as slight tempo changes that provide a tongue-in-cheek effect. The third and fourth movements are again more lyrical, like the first, but of differing natures. The former is made of weaving lines of stepwise motion in its first and third parts, with a much more active rhythmic canon trio as the second part.  The latter, a toccata, comes across as a neo-romantic/minimalist hybrid, with steady sixteenth-note motion overlaid with lines of syncopations.  Daniel Godfrey has been writing in a tonal idiom for a long time and it shows. His String Quartets 2 & 3 are lyrical and lush, contained in a mostly narrative structure, but contain just a dose of whimsy and humor, so they never descend into the mundane or trivial.  The pacing is such that the ear can easily trace the transformation of the materials. The sound world is neo-impressionistic, warm and aglow. The Cassats do a lovely job with them. All of the pieces mentioned above are serious works. They lie firmly within, and extend, the tradition. None are ironic and neither do they pander. They require concentrated listening, something that happens less and less in our time. Yet there is still a scene for serious string quartet pieces, as more and more string quartets come on line after graduating from our many conservatories and schools of music. There are still chamber music societies in many cities across the land that frequently hire string quartets. It would be great if they, and the quartets they engage, would present and perform these and other pieces of the very recent past. What if each performance were to include a classic- Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert; a work of the twentieth Century- Bartok, Shostakovich, Rochberg, Ligeti, Corigliano; and finally a newly commissioned work or one from the last twenty years or so? This isn't exactly revolutionary stuff, but wouldn't this make for a much richer experience, for performer and listener alike? What if, what if?"
ENTERTAINMENT,"Whitney Houston fans will soon be treated to “an intimate, unflinching portrait” of the legendary pop diva, who died in 2012, in a new estate-approved documentary.   “Whitney,” which hits theaters this summer, “probes beyond familiar tabloid headlines and sheds new light on the spellbinding trajectory of Houston’s life,” according to a press release sent to HuffPost. (Catch a sneak peek of the film in the trailer above.)  “Using never-before-seen archival footage, exclusive demo recordings, rare performances, audio archives and original interviews with the people who knew her best, Oscar-winning filmmaker Kevin Macdonald unravels the mystery behind ‘The Voice,’ who thrilled millions even as she struggled to make peace with her own troubled past,” the release says.  Macdonald, whose credits include 2006’s “The Last King of Scotland,” told Rolling Stone that “Whitney” is “an intimate family story that reveals a new side to a woman that even her most die-hard fans never knew.” “I approached Whitney’s life like a mystery story; why did someone with so much raw talent and beauty self-destruct so publicly and painfully? I was lucky enough to have the support of Pat Houston and the Whitney Houston estate in this quest,” he said. “They entrusted me with the ‘keys to the vault’ while giving me complete freedom to follow the story wherever it went.” “Whitney” follows an unauthorized documentary, “Whitney: Can I Be Me.” That film, directed by Nick Broomfield, sparked controversy for appearing to confirm longstanding rumors about Houston’s bisexuality by implying she was in a romantic relationship with her childhood friend Robyn Crawford.  Houston’s family, however, denounced “Whitney: Can I Be Me,” which debuted on Showtime last year.   “Whitney” hits theaters July 6.  "

ARTS & CULTURE,"Although there's much to praise in the Young Vic-Joshua Andrews co-production of Tennessee Wiliams's superb A Street Car Named Desire, now transported to St. Ann's Warehouse, the laurels go mostly to the cast. About other prominent aspects, there's much to question. Indeed, the off-kilter impression begins not when the play, directed with obvious confusion by Benedict Andrews, begins. It commences as the patrons enter to be seated on four sides and get a lengthy gander at the set. (FYI: The Young Vic is constructed as theater-in-the-round.) What patrons see, designed by Magda Willi to conjure the dilapidated Elysian Fields enclave in late 1940s New Orleans, is a large steel frame housing a pristine, predominantly white abode looking not unlike a luxury studio in a contemporary Upper East Side Manhattan high-rise. It could be more than one ticket buyer eyed the minimalist flat and thought, ""I wish I could find a place like that."" Certainly, when Blanche DuBois (Gillian Anderson) arrives to visit married younger sister Stella DuBois Kowalski (Vanessa Kirby) and starts deriding the cozy home, spectators have to be wondering why she's carrying on so. And say, what's that cordless landline telephone doing there. Huh? No computer?! Ticket buyers also have to be wondering about Blanche's immaculate appearance. She's gussied up in a tailored suit of the sort many workingwomen might be wearing to Madison Avenue offices this spring. (Victoria Behr is the costume designer.) Blanche surely doesn't look like someone who, as Williams stipulates, has been traveling all day in sweltering heat and has alighted that streetcar named Desire pretty much having slid down her tether nearly to its end but is still able to fall back on her long-mastered, desperate survival tactics. The misconception affects Blanche's earlier scenes as Anderson plays them. Announcing to Stella that their beloved Belle Reve home has been lost, she's aggressively argumentative about the sad development rather than broken and defensive in her wily manner. This goes some way towards making the compulsively dissembling, self-absorbed Blanche into someone even more unsympathetic to audience members than she should be. Before learning further about the performances, however, readers need to be alerted that the set in the round goes literally round. During the first act it moves clockwise, mostly slowly but sometimes more quickly as tension builds. In the second act, it starts going counter-clockwise--as if attempting to reverse the events of the first act. The clinical merry-go-round eventually goes clockwise again and then counter-clockwise and so on and so forth. As it rotates, everyone watching gets to see or not see the actors' fronts or backs, as, for instance, Stella sits on the bathroom toilet while having a chat with Blanche. This, by the way, doesn't appear to be one of Wiliams's stage directions, whereas Blanche crooning ""It's Only a Paper Moon"" (which is about the appeal of illusion, of course) is definitely stipulated by the playwright. Actually, this Blanche honks the old standard. Incidentally, the question during the toilet scene becomes, Is Blanche the kind of person who gabs casually with someone, even a sister, who's responding to nature's call? No, the showily fussy Blanche isn't that kind. Lacking any other recourse, she clings tenaciously to accepted manners. As for songs provided, Williams doesn't request ""You Always Hurt the One You Love,"" which sound designer Paul Arditti (at Andrews's command?) pipes in when the proceedings get underway. That's hardly the most off-putting aural insertion. Between scenes Arditti forces clashing, crashing, deafening music. Even worse, when Blanche is recalling the past and falling prey to it, he floats in eerily cliché music to let viewers who might be slow on the uptake know just how bonkers she's becoming. Luckily, the cast members, also under Andrews's direction, of course, behave for the most part as if they're in circumstances not compromised by the physical attributes provided here. The more Anderson moves into the action the more she relates--or properly loses the ability to relate--to the others. She's extremely good at Blanche's flirtations, a mixture of traditional Southern coquettishness and inborn calculation. She also knows how to pull off a drunk scene. Then, when all Blanche's marbles have rolled away, she real rolls. It may be that no other actor has to confront the memory of a previous performance than an actor succeeding Marlon Brando as the brutish but unfailingly perceptive Stanley. The physically compact, muscular Foster stands up to it solidly. Tattooed according to today's ink esthetics, he's Stanley as not only intuitively smart but noticeably intelligent. That he puts up with Blanche as long as he does becomes a credit to him, although this Stanley's rape is no more acceptable than Williams would allow. ""She's been asking for it"" remains a misguided rationale. Kirby's blond Stella is appealing and absolutely right for its being so natural. She's fallen in love with a man she knows is different from the men she was raised to admire, but she understands that those class differences are only superficial. Williams has written her as a battered wife, but whether she recognizes the situation or how long it will take her to do something about it is up in the air. Kirby's Stella is a woman weighing the pros and cons and continuing to favor the pros. Corey Johnson is an immensely likable Mitch. He confidently depicts Mitch's love for his mother and his deference to Blanche until he learns the truth she's hidden about herself. (In one of Williams's most trenchant lines Blanche insists that she only tells ""what ought to be the truth."") Johnson blends the momma's boy and the man's man elements well. Also making strong impressions are Sarah-Jane Potts and Mark Letheren as the upstairs battling Eunice and Steve Hubbell. Lachele Carl is the Mexican Woman who walks around the revolving set from time to time symbolizing something or other. The argument is being made that modernizing A Streetcar Named Desire is a perfectly reasonable approach to new productions. That may be, but if so, the modernizing displayed here isn't the right modernizing. On the other hand, Andrews makes certain that the last line is, as Williams wrote it, the devastating poker statement: ""This game is seven-card stud""--with that final ""stud"" left hanging in the torpid air as Blanche blank-eyed walks away on the arm of a calming institute doctor. Bravo for that."
POLITICS,"Last week’s school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas, that killed 10 students and teachers isn’t significantly reviving the momentum for gun control that followed the February massacre in Parkland, Florida, new HuffPost/YouGov polling suggests.  Slightly more than half of the public now calls gun violence a very serious problem, down from 60 percent in February. A 56-percent majority say it’s possible to pass new gun laws without violating the Second Amendment, down from a high of 65 percent. And, regardless of how they personally feel about the subject, just 40 percent now think passing new gun laws is politically possible, down from 50 percent. Concern about gun violence and a desire for Congress to take action are now several percentage points higher than they were in April, when most of the post-Parkland wave had already abated, but it’s difficult to say how much of that represents a genuine uptick, rather than the variability inherent in tracking polls. Either way, it’s clear that the energy around crafting new gun policies isn’t near the heights reached earlier this year. Similarly, tracking data from the progressive pollster Civiqs showed voters’ support for gun control spiking after Parkland, but then slowly declining. Santa Fe, it found, at most seemed to modestly stanch that decline. Google Trends, which tracks how often people query the search engine on varying topics, shows that comparatively little attention has been paid to gun issues following the lastest school shooting.  The difference in public opinion following the two school shootings isn’t entirely surprising: It mirrors the difference in how each community responded. Although Americans were shocked by the Parkland massacre, the shift in public opinion it produced didn’t gain steam until the weeks that followed, when the surviving students spearheaded a gun control push. Their advocacy kept the debate over gun laws in the news, even after the immediate details of the shooting had faded. Although student activists nationwide led walkouts earlier this year in protest of gun violence, polling of teens finds that such attitudes aren’t universal among their generation. In largely rural Santa Fe, last week’s shooting didn’t spark the same kind of push for gun control. There were no local protests, and little talk of guns,the Los Angeles Times reported. “I don’t think guns are the problem — I think people are the problem,” a 16-year-old Santa Fe high school student told NBC. “Even if we did more gun laws, people who are sick enough to do something like this are still going to figure out a way to do it. So it doesn’t matter.” Gun restrictions proposed in the wake of the Parkland shooting, meanwhile, remain broadly popular, according to the HuffPost/YouGov poll. Americans, 78 percent to 11 percent, say that they favor strengthening background checks for buying and selling guns. They also say, 64 percent to 22 percent, that they favor raising the age for gun purchases to 21.  A plurality, 43 percent, say President Donald Trump is not doing enough to pass gun laws, while just 6 percent believe he’s done too much.

BUSINESS,"The exposure of rampant sexual harassment is sadly in the news every day. These incidents didn’t just happen. This has been a systemic issue for years that, for many, has not been shown the light of day. While Hollywood is making headlines, sexual harassment, both overt and subtle, has taken place for years in corporate America.  On social media platforms, hundreds of thousands of women are raising their hands and saying #MeToo. Former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson’s newly released book, “Be Fierce: Stop Harassment and Take Your Power Back” is shining a bright light on workplace sexual harassment and identifying the problem not as a “women’s issue” but as a man’s  issue as well, and one that will take the engagement of men to solve. Gender diversity experts are calling the national conversation ignited by the Harvey Weinstein scandal a “watershed moment.”  Women do not go to work looking to be harassed. They want to show up, do valuable work and be treated with dignity and respect in a non-hostile workplace. Most companies and HR departments are ill-equipped to deal with these issues. Fewer than a one-third of cases of sexual harassment are ever reported, and fewer than one-third of those are prosecuted.  While the approach of many men is still choosing secrecy and “not wanting to get involved,” a small but critical mass of men are speaking up and asking, “What can I do?”  In my work with YWomen, I help companies advance women by engaging men in the conversation. Companies that are making the boldest steps to create a gender equitable workplace are often following these four steps: Listen, Learn, Lead and Have the Will to Change. These same strategies can be applied to ensure that your organization is in a place that does not tolerate sexual harassment.  Progressive organizations today are seeking solutions on how to attract, retain and advance women. Many men — I believe up to 30 percent — want to help. The challenge is knowing what to do on a daily basis to demonstrate advocacy.  Listen Genuinely listening to employee issues and concerns is the requisite first step to gaining understanding before diving into “leading.” To understand what is happening (or not happening) in your organization, it is imperative that senior leaders (typically men who comprise more than 85 percent of senior business leaders) ask women about their experiences and really listen to their answers. Carlson’s book reminds us of the stunningly low rate of reporting sexual harassment in particular. According to the EEOC, she writes, 70 percent of women who experience sexual harassment at their jobs don’t report it for fear it will cause negative repercussions, both personally and professionally. There are systemic issues in your company that are prohibiting growth, retention and development of all employees, impeding engagement and affecting your company’s reputation in the marketplace. You don’t know unless you ask. Learn All leaders, especially senior leaders, must deepen their knowledge of workplace harassment. Do you know what legally qualifies as sexual harassment or a hostile work environment? Many leaders may not know that if they witness or are told of an incident of sexual harassment, they have a responsibility to report it, and failure to do so could mean repercussions for them. Leaders and managers need to know that their jobs could be in jeopardy if they choose to ignore a situation or “not get involved.”  Leaders also need to be able to articulate the business case for advancing women. Leaders must understand how advancing women in their organization affects revenue, company reputation and talent acquisition and retention. They should also be learning about unconscious bias and discrimination against women in the workplace, what it looks like to include and advance women and why it is critical to the future of their organization to do so. Lead Leadership starts at the top of organizations with visible, vocal leadership. Think about this: You are only as good as your worst manager. If you have just one manager/leader committing sexual harassment, you need to be prepared to be front-page news. Uber is the perfect example. I don't think Travis Kalanick went to bed knowing he would lose the company he founded as the result of a heinous behavior by a middle manager — and in Uber’s case, HR was also culpable in the cover-up. Have the Will Sadly, we know the  men who tell off-color jokes, treat women as second-class citizens and perpetrate sexual harassment. Too many men are willing to just ignore the situation. It’s time for men to stand up. Having the Will means speaking up and calling out other men. If it personalizes this situation, think about a simple fact,  Picture that thought. And now remember the number from above: One-third of women in the workplace experience some type of harassment. If this isn’t enough for men to be outraged and choose to speak up, then I don’t know what it will take. Simply put, it is time for all men to stand up, speak out and support women in the workplace. Using hashtags such as #MeToo, #IHearYou, #IWillSpeakUp and #HowIWillChange, men can begin to advocate for women in the workplace and ensure that all people can do valuable, meaningful work in a safe environment. In doing so, they are pledging to treat women with respect and challenge other men when they don't. It’s not only our obligation as leaders, it’s our obligation as sons, brothers, fathers and citizens!

ENTERTAINMENT,"Airport sniffer dogs once mistook “The Great British Baking Show” judge Mary Berry’s flour for drugs, which earned her a spell inside a cell. The 83-year-old revealed the encounter, which happened some 25 years ago, in an interview on “The Graham Norton Show,” which aired in the United Kingdom on Friday night. Berry said she was worried about a trip to the U.S. to perform cookery demonstrations, so she weighed out all the ingredients, flour, sugar, and put them all in little plastic bags in advance, according to the Radio Times. But when Berry arrived at the unnamed airport, she said, the sniffer dogs made a beeline for her and she was surrounded by uniformed people who arrested her and jailed her and her assistant in separate cells. When an official asked her if she was going to make money from the packets, she replied, “I do and my fee has already been agreed,’” Berry jokingly added. Berry has been lovingly dubbed a “national treasure” in the U.K. following her role as a judge on “The Great British Bake Off.” The show in the U.S. is called “The Great British Baking Show” and airs on PBS.  The show was broadcast on the BBC, with Mary Berry judging alongside baker Paul Hollywood, for seven series, from 2010 to 2016.

BUSINESS,"  By John Stewart, SVP, DNA (Data & Analysis), DigitasLBi The Ancient Mariner’s mantra has not yet gone out of style.  We are awash in data, however brands still struggle to understand what data is valuable and how to act on what data they currently have.  The data story at CES is never front and center; you really have to delve behind the scenes for it, and that hasn’t changed at CES 2017. Some of the most interesting uses of data at CES 2017 include:  The bane of many brands is linking advertising exposure to an actual purchase, especially if that purchase is at a retail store that is unwilling to capture or share data.  This year at CES there has been an explosion of IOT data - appliances, window shades, and pillows can now be connected to the Internet, allowing brands to link purchases to media exposure once the purchased item has been activated on the web.   Brands can link TV, digital display, search, and online video advertising to a specific purchase using a matchback process, similar to how we measure direct or email today, giving a real advertising ROI and testing playground to determine what messages and media placements best drive conversion.  Eugène, a piece of hardware you use to scan UPC codes of everything you put into the trash, is an amazing source of data.  Not only do consumers love it, as it teaches then what can be recycled and how, but it also gives marketers insight into purchases and consumption at the individual household level.  This can be used to forecast demand, matchback advertising to purchase and better understand consumer behavior – and that’s actual, not reported behavior, which is always better.  What if you want to live off the grid and keep your data all to yourself?  People naturally don’t like being spied on, and many don’t understand the privacy rules in place to protect us.  The recent data breeches from trusted places like Homeland Security and Yahoo! haven’t helped, either.  There was a new product in Eureka Park called eBlocker.  It’s a piece of hardware that plugs into your router and that’s it, it’s installed!   eBlocker then instantly blocks all takers, tracking add, anonymizes your IP.  It can also be configured to allow specific sites to pass data through if you’d like  Data is still often considered a byproduct of a new product, and brands that are sitting on reams of data should be thinking about how to use it.  Not acting on your data now lets a competitor leapfrog you and the gap may be impossible to overcome.  If you aren’t figuring out how to use your data now, you can rest uneasily (even on your Internet-enabled pillow) that someone else will."
BUSINESS,"Harvey. Irma. Maria. In a hyperactive hurricane season, the mere mention of these storms evokes fear, dread -- and regret. But this year feels a little different, maybe because of the proliferation of rip-offs that followed these disasters, from repair fraud to relief scams. And these swindles continue in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico -- and perhaps even in your own neighborhood. ""There are the normal scams that occur after a hurricane that have become tried and true,"" says Daniel Stermer, the mayor of Weston, Fla., and a former prosecutor who handled price gouging claims and other fraud-related crimes. ""They include debris cleanup, storm shutter removal, tree trimming, home repairs, and other things that homeowners need immediately and do not have a frame of reference on whether the price they are being quoted is reasonable or truly price gouging and a scam."" Since this year's storms have been so intense, the scammers are reaching new victims, particularly when it comes to hurricane-related charities. To get the full picture, you have to look at what happened, consider what might happen, and talk to hurricane scam experts. And it quickly becomes clear that even though the storms are past, the worst is not over. The picture remains grim in the states hardest hit by these hurricanes. Bottom line: You can fall for a swindle without being in a state, or even a country, affected by a hurricane. And this year's wave of hurricane scams, like the storms themselves, have been remarkable: Repair scams  “After a storm like Harvey or Irma, beware of contractors who promise to rebuild – especially if they ask for a deposit and say that they can collect the remaining balance from your insurance company,"" says Peter Duncanson, director of operations and safety with ServiceMaster Restore, one of the nation’s largest disaster restoration companies. ""Do your due diligence – and only rely on trusted, professional companies.” As someone who has been taken in by a repair scam in, of all places, the Florida Keys, I agree. My own fence repair cost me thousands of dollars extra after an unlicensed contractor skipped town with my deposit. Repair scams hit you where the hurricane hit you -- your roof, fence, backyard, floors, and ultimately, your wallet. Always work with a licensed and bonded contractor and check references to make sure he or she is legit. Insurance scams  ""Be careful with public adjusters pretending to work for the insurance carrier,"" warns Stacey Giulianti, the chief legal officer and director of Florida Peninsula Insurance Company's Special Investigation Unit. He's overseen numerous hurricane-related scams and notes that public adjusters are for-hire adjusters that represent the insured, but many times gain access to the home by representing themselves as carrier adjusters. ""Many take a large percentage of the insurance proceeds, leaving the policyholder with insufficient funds to repair the dwelling,"" she says. A second, related scam: repair contractors seeking an ""assignment of benefits."" This document often cuts you out of the adjustment process, and allows the repair company to charge whatever it wants, submitting it right to the insurance company, without any knowledge by the homeowner. In the long term it raises insurance for everyone, notes Giulianti. ""Be extremely cautious before providing anyone with any personal information and immediately report suspected fraudulent activity related to recovery, cleanup, and false insurance claims,"" says Stephen Johnson, senior vice president of property and casualty claims for Assurant, the country’s second-largest provider of flood insurance. Fake charity scams  ""Beware of fake charity websites set up to take advantage of those looking to donate for a recent disaster,"" warns Michael Lai, CEO of Sitejabber.com, a ratings site. After every major disaster, fake websites spring up that take advantage of people who want to help, he says. ""For example, after the Haiti earthquake, there were fake Haiti earthquake relief sites. It was simply astounding."" What to do? Look up your charity on a site like Charity Navigator or GuideStar to ensure it's legit. Never send charity money through a wire transfer, Western Union or MoneyGram. A reputable nonprofit never requests money by wire transfer, says Lai. ""If you can, use a credit card or PayPal which will offer fraud protection."" Never give out personal information, such as your social security number, or home address to someone calling to ask for a donation. Criminals posing as officials  This is perhaps the worst scam of all, because it victimizes the victims all over again. Case in point: A Florida utility that posted a scam alert about criminals posing as utility workers and then robbing residents at gunpoint. Subsequent news reports suggested that no one had been robbed, at least yet, but there's some truth that scammers pose as officials in order to gain the trust -- and access the pocketbooks -- of hurricane victims. How do you avoid this scam? Do your homework, say utility officials. ""Ask for proper identification,"" says Nicholas Santillo, the chief security officer for American Water, one of the largest water utilities in the United States. ""Do not open the door to anyone who can't provide a photo ID badge. Thoroughly inspect the identification badge. Check the service person's vehicle. All American Water vehicles have the company's logo clearly displayed on the side."" Even if you're not robbed, you could face other scams, such as solicitation of a prepaid debit card. And remember, utility workers almost always show up by appointment (eventually). Scammers show up unannounced. The latest wave of hurricanes has unleashed a wave of scams on everyone, not just the unfortunate people located in the path of these monster storms. If you don't pay attention, you could fall for one of these scams. Only do business with a licensed contractor, donate to a licensed charity, and deal directly with your insurance company. Otherwise, you could be the next victim. Christopher Elliott specializes in solving unsolvable consumer problems. Contact him with your questions on his advocacy website.

But he also continues to spread his message today, via both words and action. Last year, March: Book Three, a graphic novel co-written by Lewis, was awarded the National Book Award for Young People’s Literature, a feat that he responded to with a speech about being turned away by a public library when he was 16, only to continue his quest to educate himself. Since Trump’s accusations, sales of Lewis’ book have gone up, earning it several of the bestselling slots on Amazon. If that’s not evidence enough of tangible influence, maybe this is: Today, March: Book Three received another award, one that will put the graphic novel in the hands of young readers. Ron Charles reported for The Washington Post that the book was given the Walter Dean Myers Award for Outstanding Children’s Literature, awarded by We Need Diverse Books. As a result, 2,000 copies will be donated to “U.S. schools with limited budgets.” Lewis told Charles: “It is my hope that [the award] will inspire more people to read and to use their pen to inspire another generation to speak up and speak out.” Talk, action, results: Lewis gracefully demonstrates how the three can be interwoven."
POLITICS,"President Donald Trump announced Thursday that the historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will take place on June 12 in Singapore. The revelation follows Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s second visit to Pyongyang to meet with North Korean officials. Trump said Wednesday that a date and site had been set, but declined to reveal the details. The Trump administration has worked for months to bring the reclusive regime to the negotiating table. Enlisting China in helping spearhead the denuclearization dialogue, Trump has successfully set up the first face-to-face meeting between North Korean and American leaders. Kim Jong Un has also met with the leaders of China and South Korea to discuss regional security, resulting in the two Koreas declaring an official end to the Korean war. The highly anticipated meeting between Kim Jong Un and myself will take place in Singapore on June 12th. We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace! Kim expressed support for the “historic meeting,” calling it a first step toward the “building of a good future” on the Korean Peninsula. In another sign that negotiations with the North Koreans are progressing, Pompeo returned to Washington, D.C., early Thursday with the three Americans that had been held captive in North Korea."
ARTS & CULTURE,"On May 15, when the American Civil Liberties Union called for an investigation into the entertainment industry's ""systemic failure"" to hire female directors, the call was heard around the entertainment world. It sparked a lot of talk about the dismal number of women directors in Hollywood and the scarcity of films being produced with strong female leads.  ""There is so much focus on the problem and too little talk about the solution,""
says independent filmmaker, Paige Morrow Kimball.  With only seven percent of women directors at the helm of the 250 top-grossing movies last year and little opportunity for women to play meaty roles after the age of 40, Kimball, a former reality TV producer/director saw a need and answered the call.
My solution is to write films about women, and hire as many women as possible both in front of and behind the camera. I've always had an independent spirit, and now with crowd funding and technology I don't have to wait for a 'yes', I can make it happen. Patience has never been my greatest virtue. With her newest film, Play Date, Kimball wrote a script with three strong female leads and hired mostly women in key positions, including Producer, AD, DP, Production Designer, Editor and more. Play Date is a short film about a seven-year-old girl who discovers a homeless woman in her backyard and invites her inside for a play date, while her parents are too distracted to notice.   With this film Kimball not only created roles for women in front of and behind the camera, but she also tackled the global issue of homelessness. She was inspired to write the script for Play Date when a chance wrong turn led her through L.A.'s famed Skid Row. ""I was headed to a concert at dusk, and was shocked to see dozens of homeless people on the streets setting up their tents for the night,"" says Kimball.  This went on for blocks and blocks and I was upset and ashamed that this was happening a few miles from my home and I had never witnessed it. I went home that night and Play Date poured out of me. Play Date is a short film designed for families to watch together. It raises the issue of the invisibility of homelessness in a magical, entertaining way and also explores the distraction parents face with the rising demands of technology.  As parents, in Los Angeles, we're busy and we don't tend see what is happening right in our back yards. We're starting to see more homeless tents all over L.A. but it's an issue that's tempting to ignore it because if feels so unsolvable. ""When I read the script I was so moved,"" says Terry Walters who got on board as the films lead actress and as a producer. ""It was an opportunity for me to give back, play a meaty role and work with a independent director who is thinking out of the box."" To raise money for the film, Kimball and Walters launched a crowd funding campaign that was designed to give back as well. A percentage of the proceeds were donated to OPCC (Ocean Park Community Center in Santa Monica) and the campaign created waves. The film's transformative message was featured in Forbes Magazine and reached several celebrities who got on board, as it's associate producers and backers, including Calista Flockhart, Mary McDonnell, Jayne Atkinson, Jon Tenney, Rob Morrow and more. The film also resonated with John Maceri, Executive Director at OPCC. Maceri is widely regarded as one of the country's most innovative and effective leaders in housing and services for the most vulnerable in our community and is known for his transformative Ted Talk: Can Homelessness be Solved? ""The film is socially relevant and has so many layers to it,"" says John Maceri of OPCC.  It's a magical realism family film that appeals to a wide range of ages and backgrounds. People leave the screenings wanting to make the world a better place... not an easy thing to do in 15 minutes. OPCC is on board to help develop Play Date out as an educational program to community centers, religious organizations and schools. ""Play Date shows us that every human being has a story, and it asks the question, what can I do to make a difference?"" says Maceri.  ""Rather than trying to fix the problem, we must bring it to light, and start the conversation, especially with future generations,"" says Walters.  You either get depressed talking about it, or ask yourself, 'What small thing can I do to be part of a solution?' We're changing perception from the ground up, and the beauty is we don't need anybody's permission to do it. We can create on our own. Play Date will make it's World Premiere this Saturday June 6 at the Dances With Kidz Film Festival in Los Angeles.  Whether trying to change perception about homelessness or helping raise the numbers of women working in Hollywood, Kimball continues to attempt to create positive change, one film at a time. I made this film for my daughters, who are nine and 12, to show them that they can be anything they want. And they can make a difference, no matter how seemingly small to help make the world a better place.  Paige Morrow Kimball directing Isabella Spencer and Tami Roman

BUSINESS,"The Verizon NY 2016 Annual Report was released at the end of May, 2017 and the IRREGULATORS just put out an analysis: “Follow the Money: Financial Analysis and Implications.” (It part of our ongoing series, Fixing Telecom.) At the core of this, Verizon NY is still the state-based telecommunications utility serving the majority of New York State. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the holding company, Verizon Communications. Meanwhile, AT&T California or AT&T Illinois, (controlled by AT&T) or Verizon Massachusetts or Verizon Pennsylvania are also state-based utilities. Alongside this, there was an ‘evidentiary hearing’ planned for June 26th, 2017 as part of an investigation of the quality of service of Verizon New York’s wireline networks, but also of its business practices. However, as of this writing it appears Verizon has decided it might be time to discuss a settlement. One would suspect the plan is to shut down these proceedings before they get out of hand and to stop further ‘discovery’. Click to read the documents filed. (Some of the issues brought up in this investigation stem from one of our earlier reports published in 2012.) Based on what we uncovered over the last five years, every state and every city in the US should be demanding answers and calling for investigations of the Verizon, AT&T and CenturyLink incumbent state utilities that control the copper and fiber optic wires (even the wires to the cell sites). Moreover, the FCC needs to be taken to court as its accounting rules are the cause of massive financial cross-subsidies that have been going on for over a decade, and the FCC’s plans are to erase the rules instead of fix them. Follow the Money: The Primary Findings Verizon NY’s financials have been manipulated to make local service/the copper wires look unprofitable. Verizon customers received multiple rate increases based on “massive deployment of fiber optics” and ‘losses’. The ‘losses’ were not caused by the local service/wireline business, but through various means. Local Service is paying the majority of all expenses. For example, Local Service is paying 60% of the Corporate Operations expenses. At the same time, Verizon subsidiaries, like Verizon Wireless, are only paying a fraction of the expenses to use the networks. Instead of upgrading the cities or even maintaining the existing infrastructure, in NY a large part of the utility capex was diverted to build out the wireless business. At the same time, “Special Access” services (renamed “Business Data Services”) have a 50+ profit margin, even though they are using the exact same wires as Local Service. Local phone customers in New York, especially low income families and rural areas, all paid extra—about $1,500 and counting, for these cross-subsidies. At issue is not just the ‘landlines’ or the wired network but the impacts on all services and companies that use the wires, from competitors offering service to the cost of wireless service. And, let us stress that while these companies have tried very hard to remove or deny the fact that they are utilities, (like water or electricity), the truth is that these companies control the wires—not only the copper wires but also the fiber optic wires that are used for FiOS or are the wires that go to the cell sites to offer cell phone service or are used for ‘hot spots’. And these are also the wires used for services that are supposed to offer competition to the cable provider or to make sure that there is phone service available so that someone can call E911 in an emergency. Putting this in Perspective The Verizon NY 2016 Annual Report is part of and must be seen in light of what is happening throughout the US and at the FCC. First, New York is the only state we found that requires the incumbents to do an annual report, though some states keep the info and require a FOIA request to obtain it. The FCC has never audited these financial books, even though they are making rules that directly impact customers, cities, etc. FCC’s Corrupted Cost Accounting Rules are to Blame for the Cross-Subsidies. Worse, the FCC’s accounting rules have caused much of this overcharging as they are set to reflect the expenses based on the year 2000, 17 years ago. In 2001, the FCC ‘froze’ the allocation of costs so that every year, regardless of the revenues, the expenses would be applied as if it was the year 2000. This has made Local Service look unprofitable on paper and has placed the majority of expenses into Local Service. Local Service was 65% of the revenues in 2000 and paid 65% of the expense; in 2016 it is only 23% of the revenues but pays 56% of the expenses. This also had the effect of cross-subsidizing all of the other lines of business in multiple ways as Local Service customers are paying the expenses that should be paid by the other Verizon subsidiaries. For the excruciating details of this accounting boondoggle see our reports: “The Hartman Memorandum” and “The History & Rules of Setting Phone Rates in America”. FCC Actions This current FCC is oblivious to the actual markets, financial data or the public interest, it would seem. In fact, the FCC has multiple proceedings underway or recently decided. The FCC’s plan includes: “Shut Off the Copper” — The FCC has a group of proceedings to remove all obligations or regulations and is planning on giving the incumbent phone companies, including Verizon New York, the right to ‘shut off the copper’ as a federal law, preempting state laws. “Business Data Services” (also known as “Special Access”) Deregulation — These services use the same wires that are used for phone service. The FCC has ruled that the incumbents can shut off various classes of these services or not have to rent them at reasonable rates to competitors including the wireless companies. (Sprint and Windstream have already filed an appeal.) Erasing the FCC’s Accounting Rules — The FCC has multiple current proceedings, some already decided, to erase all obligations, such requiring the use of the Uniform System of Accounting (USOA). The FCC has also extended the ‘freeze’ on how the expenses are allocated until 2018 so it can finish removing all rules instead of fixing them, thus immortalizing the harms. “IP Transition” — Rarely mentioned anymore, this is actually a plan to shut off the copper and claim that the ‘old’, “Title II” services should be replaced with new services, even though they use the exact same wires. The other part of the plan is to force customers onto wireless. Net Neutrality, Title II, Privacy — The FCC has decided to kill off Net Neutrality and restrict privacy by letting these few companies control the wires as they see fit, public be damned. The IRREGULATORS filed in some of these current FCC proceedings. State Actions: Besides the current investigation in New York: The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission just required Verizon to fix parts of the copper infrastructure in some areas where the company has not deployed FiOS, fiber to the home. The Illinois State legislature voted to remove the obligations of the incumbent telephone companies to offer service or repair the existing service. With all of these activities one thing is abundantly clear; most of the regulators and politicians have no idea about the actual revenues, expenses and cross-subsidies that are in play. And it is clear that the FCC has never examined the actual impacts of their own distorted accounting rules, but is removing the rules and obligations without basic facts, with the outcome—help the phone companies and harm customers. In fact, the FCC’s ‘shut off the copper’ proceeding never uses the word “utility” in context to the access lines in service, or even mentions how many total lines are in service. Examining the Financials Here are two exhibits detailing the revenues and expenses taken directly from the Verizon New York 2016 Annual Report. (Read “Follow the Money” report for details and caveats.) Verizon New York Revenues and Losses, 2016  (Note: The exhibits are excerpts and not the full accounting.) $5.2 billion in revenues for wireline telecom services in just New York — The wires are still in use and the utility company is still enormous. NOTE: These are not all of the revenues of Verizon in New York; it leaves out revenues from Verizon Online, Verizon Business, Verizon Long Distance or Verizon Wireless, among other Verizon affiliates that use the wireline networks. $1.2 billion of revenue, 23%, are from Local Service. $2.5 billion of revenue (47%), are from “Access” services (83% are “Business Data Services”). 50% EBITDA for Access services. Using the exact same wires for Local Service, somehow Access services had a whopping 50% profit margin in New York, while Local Service lost money. $1.1 billion in losses are shown in the 2016 financial report. The report shows that $2.1 billion dollars was claimed as losses for just Local Service. $1 billion of annual losses for years. Verizon NY claims it keeps losing money (not counting accounting changes) and has been hemorrhaging one billion+ a year since at least 2009. Not paying most taxes. Verizon New York uses these losses for multiple benefits, including not paying many taxes, which also helps the holding company. Breakout of the Revenues and Expenses as a Percentage of the Total But something is seriously amiss. If you examine the percentages of the expenses being charged to Local Service, somehow Local Service is paying the majority of expenses. Local Service was charged 56% of all expenses, including Corporate Operations, Marketing and Construction and Maintenance (Plant). Local Service was charged 60% of Corporate Operations, which can include the corporate jets, or the lawyers to defend rate increases or getting rid of Net Neutrality. Local Service paid 44% of Construction and Maintenance (“Plant”) even though it only generated 23% of revenues. Even the Number of Access Lines has been Manipulated. 2.2 million “POTS”, plain old telephone service, copper-based Verizon NY lines are in service. These are only a fraction of the total lines, copper or fiber, in place. “0” Access lines for $4 billion in revenue. The financial report supplies zero lines for either the Access services or the Nonregulated services, which include revenues from part of the FIOS services. How can $4 billion dollars in revenue have no access lines listed? 7-8 million lines are potentially missing from the “landline”/access line accounting. All of the “interstate” services, like special access or FiOS, all lines rented to competitors and all ‘IP-based’ lines are not included in the NY State or FCC or Verizon accounting. I.e., the majority of Verizon NY access lines in use in 2016 have been hidden from view. Construction Budgets Diverted to Wireless Much of the construction budgets have been diverted to pay for the wireless networks – which has meant that the cities were not properly upgraded and maintained by the utilities. 5,515 cell sites were built from 2010-2013 at a cost estimated to be $2.8 billion and charged to Verizon New York. According to Verizon’s own press statements, this came out of the wireline construction budgets. $6.5-$7.5 billion in revenue was generated by Verizon Wireless, we estimate, in just New York State. Only $69 million was paid to Verizon New York from “Cellco Partners” (Verizon Wireless is a D/B/A) for use of the networks and any construction – which now includes the fiber that was supposed to be used for FiOS, the Fiber to the Home service, but are now wires to the wireless antennas. Verizon NY Estimated Overcharging and Underbilling $1.4 billion was overcharged to Local Service based on revenues, in just 2016. Local Service is profitable if the actual costs were properly assigned. $1.2 billion of expense was not properly allocated to Access services, based on costs. $1,500 per line was overcharged to local phone customers through multiple rate increases due to ‘losses’ and “massive deployment of fiber optics” (from 2006-2015). Prices should have been in steep decline because of major staff cuts and cutbacks in Local Service construction expenses. However, we are told by Verizon, the FCC and State that there is plenty of competition. Isn’t competition supposed to lower prices? Implications  By claiming Local Service loses money and that the wires are not being used, or that the networks are not profitable enough to even upgrade and maintain, Verizon has manipulated every aspect of public policy. National Issue; Federal and State Issue This financial shell game is a state-by-state as well as a national and federal issue as it has been happening in every state and it impacts every city, and it is based on the FCC’s deformed federal accounting rules. This next exhibit supplies the “Corporate Operations” expense from the FCC’s 2007 “ARMIS” reports which covered the state-based telecom utilities, and it is the last available data. In this exhibit we sorted this group to detail the range of Corporation Operations expense added to the Local Service expenses. Conclusion The Verizon NY 2016 Annual Report reveals a massive cross-subsidy scheme that has been in play for over a decade. It also reveals that there are massive holes in the FCC’s current and proposed plans to erase the accounting rules, shut off the copper, or deregulate special access. Instead, the FCC should be investigating these issues, not attempting to cover them up by erasing the accounting rules. This will only immortalize the cross-subsidies.  The current investigation in New York has been underway for over a year, and it is being spearheaded by the Communications Workers of America, CWA.  We applaud their efforts but for us the examination of the cross-subsidies and financial hanky panky was first documented in our report in 2012, which was filed with the NY State PSC and ignored, as were the multiple updates to that research. This new Verizon NY 2016 Annual Report shows that while a settlement in New York may curtail some egregious acts, it is not a cure, especially with the FCC’s current plans.  It is time that every state and every city call for and start investigations and use this as a roadmap for change. And it is time to take the FCC to court over their current and proposed plans."
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — The leaders of a South African group that has referred to apartheid as a “so-called” historical injustice recently toured Washington and met with top members of the U.S. government, including officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development and staffers for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). They even bumped into national security adviser John Bolton.  AfriForum, an Afrikaner rights organization, promotes the idea that white people in South Africa are under attack by that country’s government. It has been trying to spread its message internationally.  During their meetings in Washington, AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel and deputy CEO Ernst Roets handed out copies of Roets’ book Kill the Boer, which pushes the controversial claim that white farmers are being singled out for systematic violence in South Africa. On Wednesday, Kriel and Roets met with USAID officials at the agency’s Washington headquarters. It’s unclear whether the officials were aware of AfriForum’s views prior to the meeting. “USAID meets with a wide variety of organizations to gather perspectives on political, economic, social, and development trends in countries where we operate,” a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, wrote HuffPost. “USAID programmed approximately $258 million in FY 2017 resources in South Africa for programs that strengthen small businesses, create employment, improve job skills, promote basic education, combat gender-based violence, and promote HIV/AIDS care, prevention, and treatment.” A spokeswoman for USAID declined to comment further. Roets would not say whether AfriForum is seeking funding from the development agency.   Also on Wednesday, Kriel and Roets posed for a photo with Bolton at a Fox News studio, according to National Security Council spokesman Robert Palladino. Bolton did not know the AfriForum leaders, Palladino added. But the duo tried their best to make an impression: They gave Bolton a copy of Roets’ book and posted the picture on Twitter. Great turn of events: With a bit of luck @ErnstRoets and I met John Robert Bolton, USA National Security Advisor to @realDonaldTrump. We also gave him a copy of Ernst's new #KillTheBoerBook on #FarmMurders & #ExpropriationWithoutCompensation  in SA. @afriforum #AfriForumUSA . pic.twitter.com/CIEIqmyA3O AfriForum, which describes itself as a civil rights group, was formed in 2006 as an outgrowth of a white trade union. It focuses on the rights of Afrikaners, a South African ethnic group largely descended from Dutch and French Huguenot settlers. The organization has 280,000 dues-paying members, according to Roets.  Although AfriForum does not typically make explicitly racist statements, it often uses misleading or false data to characterize South Africa as a country in which white people are oppressed. When a South African land reform scholar tweeted statistics that undercut its claims about attacks against white farmers, Roets appeared to threaten her in a rant posted last Saturday on YouTube. “Violent crime is a serious problem on farms, as it is in some urban areas in South Africa, but there is no indication that it is anything other than ordinary crime, and it certainly doesn’t justify a narrative of deliberate targeting of whites on the basis of their ethnicity,” said Nic Dawes, a deputy executive director at Human Rights Watch. “AfriForum uses the language of rights in pursuit of an agenda which is really about preserving white privilege in South Africa and elsewhere.” A quarter-century after the end of white-minority rule in South Africa, the country’s white population still owns 72 percent of privately held farmland and a mere 10 percent of South Africans own 90 percent of the nation’s wealth. The post-apartheid government has bought up land for redistribution and assigned it to new owners, on the grounds that many were descended from black South Africans who unjustly lost their property during the colonial era and white rule. But the idea of allowing the government to confiscate land without compensation has gained traction amidst public dissatisfaction with the governing African National Congress party. In February, the South African Parliament called for constitutional reform that might permit such initiatives to boost black land ownership. AfriForum and others have seized on the idea of “land expropriation” as evidence of white South Africans being unjustly persecuted. They also claim that ongoing attacks on white farmers are racially motivated rather than part of the country’s broader problem with violent crime. Roets described the notion of expropriation without compensation to HuffPost as if it were an imminent policy change, rather than a proposal up for debate. Experts on the South African situation say it’s unlikely that commercially vital white-owned farms will actually be seized and suggest the dispute is being exaggerated for political reasons. AfriForum’s leaders traveled to the U.S. — stopping in Texas and Washington, D.C. — to raise awareness about violence against farmers and land expropriation, Roets said. The AfriForum leaders also took their message to the studio of pro-white nationalist Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson and to the halls of Congress, where they met with staffers in Cruz’s office and “at least one” member of the House of Representatives, Roets said. He declined to name the member. We had a very constructive meeting in the office of Senator Ted Cruz today. #AfriForumUSA@afriforum @kalliekriel pic.twitter.com/cGr8lRG5aW In addition, Roets and Kriel tweeted about meetings at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank; the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank; and the International Republican Institute, a democracy promotion nonprofit that receives U.S. government funding. “We agreed that rule of law and property rights are essential components of economic development,” Marian Tupy, a senior policy analyst at Cato, told HuffPost in an email. “Conversely, expropriation without compensation is incompatible with tranquility and prosperity. [The] international community should do what it can to dissuade [the South African] government from embracing catastrophic policies that destroyed Cuba, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.” Asked about AfriForum’s apparently dismissive comment about apartheid being a “so-called” historical injustice, Tupy said there “should be no doubt that apartheid was a historical injustice” ― and then suggested there were similarities between the current South African government and the apartheid regime. “The current policies of [the South African] government are explicitly racist, because not all South African citizens are treated equally before the law (some people are favored over others, as was the case under apartheid),” Tupy wrote. Roets disputes that AfriForum ever questioned whether apartheid was an injustice. In his telling of the story, an AfriForum legal representative used the phrase “so-called ‘historical injustice’” to refer to an argument from the opposing side during a court case over removing Afrikaans street names. The phrase was taken out of context, Roets told HuffPost. Some in Washington appear to be persuaded by Roets’ narrative. “It is my understanding that AfriForum did not refer to ‘so-called’ injustices of apartheid; that we all agree that apartheid was an unjust system; that the words ‘so-called’ were lifted out of context to besmirch the reputation of AfriForum; and that a non-racial society based on individual, not group, identity ought to be the goal in South Africa,” Tupy wrote in an unprompted follow-up email that included Roets on the cc line. But in its complaint laying out the facts in the court case, AfriForum “repeatedly refers to the Municipality’s attempts at correcting ‘so-called ‘historical injustices of the past,’” two judges on the Constitutional Court of South Africa wrote in a 2016 judgment.  Roets has also referred to apartheid as a “woolly concept,” a comment he stands by. “What I mean by that is that it is a term that everyone is talking about, but if you ask people what it means, everyone would give a different answer,” he said. “Racism is also a woolly concept, democracy is also a woolly concept, reconciliation is a woolly concept.” Asked what apartheid meant to him, Roets said it was a “system of categorizing people according to the color of their skin and it was a system that failed miserably.” But he argued that the current South African government is engaged in the same kind of “government social engineering.” Far-right groups in South Africa are working hard to win support abroad. They’ve received help from U.S. and Canadian commentators like Alex Jones, Ann Coulter, Mike Cernovich and Lauren Southern who have pushed their narrative of white persecution. AfriForum’s work has helped “feed the efforts of the conspiracy theorists and hate networks that hope to create a globalized narrative of white victimhood,” Dawes of Human Rights Watch said. “The anti-immigrant and racist sentiment they peddle is too often informing the policy agendas of governments and political parties outside South Africa.” Earlier this year in Australia — a popular destination for the nearly half-million white South Africans who have emigrated since apartheid ended — Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton pledged to issue fast-track visas to white farmers he called “persecuted.” The Australian government backtracked after official complaints from South Africa and a United Nations statement urging Australia to save visas for people in greater need, like the hundreds of refugees it has detained offshore. AfriForum’s visit to the U.S. was a success, Roets said. He appeared happily surprised by his group’s ability to land meetings with American government officials. “We achieved much more than we thought we would — in terms of how we were received, in terms of the people we met with, who we were able to get in touch with,” he said. The Heritage Foundation, the International Republican Institute and Cruz’s office did not respond to requests for comment."
ARTS & CULTURE,"”She’s a woman who knows what she wants ― and knows what she’s doing,” murmurs a sensual voiceover to a “Saturday Night Live” parody ad for an Ivanka Trump fragrance. Now, the perfume’s name ― Complicit ― is enjoying a popularity boost familiar to words associated with President Donald Trump: It’s surging in lookups on Merriam-Webster.com, according to the site’s blog. “Complicit” sits atop the current trending list, above “neophyte,” “incredulous,” “refute,” and “recuse.” The “SNL” spoof ad, starring host Scarlett Johansson as Ivanka Trump, promotes a fictional perfume, Complicit, dubbing it “the fragrance for the woman who could stop all this, but won’t.” The voiceover slyly mocks Ivanka’s brand as an empowered woman and feminist, as well as a glamorous socialite. It’s an image, the spot suggests, that juxtaposes poorly with the visible and reportedly influential role she plays in her father’s campaign and administration. It specifically calls out her failure to distance herself from her father’s campaign after the infamous Access Hollywood tape leaked. The tape featured an audio recording of Trump apparently confessing to grabbing women by their genitals without prior consent. “A feminist, an advocate, a champion for women ― but, like, how?” the voiceover purrs at one point. Answers may vary on that front, but one thing is clear: “Complicit” is an adjective meaning “helping to commit a crime or do wrong in some way.” Just so we all know."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Actor Morgan Freeman spoke out again in the wake of sexual harassment allegations against him, saying Friday that he was “devastated” by the turn of events. Several women accused the Oscar winner of inappropriate behavior, including lewd comments and unwanted touching, according to a CNN investigation. “I am devastated that 80 years of my life is at risk of being undermined, in the blink of an eye, by Thursday’s media reports,” Morgan said in a statement sent to media, according to outlets. “All victims of assault and harassment deserve to be heard. And we need to listen to them. But it is not right to equate horrific incidents of sexual assault with misplaced compliments or humor.” Credit card company Visa and Vancouver transportation company TransLink (in a Visa promotion) suspended campaigns featuring Freeman after the accusations surfaced. In the CNN report, one unidentified woman who worked on the film “Going in Style” in 2015 accused Freeman of repeatedly trying to lift up her skirt and asking her if she was wearing underwear. Freeman initially apologized for unintentionally making anyone feel uncomfortable or disrespected and reiterated those sentiments in part of his statement on Friday. But, he added, “I also want to be clear: I did not create unsafe work environments. I did not assault women. I did not offer employment or advancement in exchange for sex. Any suggestion that I did so is completely false.” A spokesman for Freeman told HuffPost on Saturday: “We have no further comments to make at this time.”"
ENTERTAINMENT,"Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has a new baby girl named Tiana Gia Johnson. The actor, 45, announced the birth of his second daughter with girlfriend Lauren Hashian in an adorable photo posted to Instagram on Monday. “Skin to skin. Our mana,” the proud papa wrote. “Blessed and proud to bring another strong girl into this world.” A post shared by therock (@therock) on Apr 23, 2018 at 10:52am PDT Johnson then described the labor like a true action star. “Tiana Gia Johnson came into this world like a force of nature and Mama @laurenhashianofficial labored and delivered like a true rockstar,” he wrote. Johnson then ended his thought like the lead in a great romantic comedy: “I was raised and surrounded by strong, loving women all my life, but after participating in baby Tia’s delivery, it’s hard to express the new level of love, respect and admiration I have for @laurenhashianofficial and all mamas and women out there.” The couple is already parents to 2-year-old daughter Jasmine Lia. The former wrestler is also a father to 16-year-old Simone Alexandra. In his post, he embraced all the girl power in his life and offered a “word to the wise” to the gentlemen out there. “If you really want to understand the single most powerful and primal moment life will ever offer - watch your child being born,” he wrote. “Its [sic] a life changer and the respect and admiration you have for a woman, will forever be boundless.” The “Ballers” star also made his new bundle of joy the same promise he made to his other daughters ― to “protect, guide and make ya laugh for the rest of my life.” Johnson seemed pretty gung-ho on the whole laughter aspect of the promise, concluding his post with, “Oh and one more thing.. you’re gonna love rollin’ in daddy’s pick up truck.” We’re guessing Tiana may eventually have a good chuckle too when looking back at some moments in her father’s versatile career."
POLITICS,"Brits expressed astonishment Saturday after President Donald Trump blasted London knife fights in his speech boosting gun ownership at the National Rifle Association convention. Britain’s homicide rate is a fraction of America’s. Trump told the NRA convention in Dallas on Friday that a “once very prestigious” London hospital was “like a war zone for horrible stabbing wounds.” He said London has “unbelievably tough gun laws,” adding, “they don’t have guns; they have knives and instead there’s blood all over the floors of this hospital.” He then stabbed the air several times, pretending to hold a knife, as he uttered, “Knives, knives, knives.” London political leaders and physicians condemned Trump’s remarks and called any implication that guns would stem a troubling increase in knife violence outlandish. “To suggest guns are part of the solution is ridiculous,” said surgeon Karim Brohi of the Royal London Hospital in a statement. “Gunshot wounds are at least twice as lethal as knife injuries and more difficult to repair.”    Britain effectively banned handgun ownership after a 1996 school shooting. According to figures from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the murder rate in the U.S. is approximately five times higher than Britain’s. There were 4.9 intentional homicides per 100,000 people in 2015 in the U.S. and .90 per 100,000 in 2014 in Britain, according to the U.N. statistics. “Trump lies on everything,” former British justice secretary Charlie Falconer said before contrasting the nations’ murder rates. He also said such comments hurt relations between the countries.  “Trump makes Londoners dislike him more, and the U.S. dislike London more,” he told The Guardian. “Trump gives the impression he couldn’t give a fig.”  4.88 per 100000 murdered in US per annum, 0.92 per 100000 in UK.  Implication UK has similar murder rate to US except knives not guns obviously false.  Trump lies on everything, but lots of people in US now believe London a knife-armed war zone. https://t.co/4G9JGLeWBg Trauma surgeon Martin Griffiths of the Royal London Hospital complained recently about the increase in knife crime — which rose 21 percent last year in the U.K. — in a BBC Radio interview that was picked up by Breitbart. That was likely the source of Trump’s comments. At least 35 people were fatally stabbed in London by April of this year. But despite the recent spike, London remains safe compared to a number American cities, the BBC recently reported. In 2017, London’s murder rate per 100,000 people was 1.2. New York City’s rate was nearly three times higher. Baltimore’s rate was more than 45 times higher than London’s, according to FBI data. In a tweet Saturday, Griffiths indicated that Trump missed his point about London violence entirely with an animation showing the words “the point” floating over the head of a stick figure. He offered to invite Trump to “my (prestigious) hospital” to meet with London’s police commissioner and mayor to discuss the city’s success in reducing violence.  Happy to invite Mr Trump to my (prestigious) hospital to meet with our mayor and police commissioner to discuss our successes in violence reduction in London @SadiqKhan @metpoliceuk @NHSBartsHealth #WindrushAwards pic.twitter.com/G4vYqTkfbL .@realDonaldTrump disgraceful speech - UK knife crime nowhere near your off-the-scale gun deaths. When you come to London, come and meet our amazing young people, youth workers and NHS workers instead of banquets and pomp: BBC News https://t.co/46vmRqQzMP London comedy writer Robert Webb joked about his “war zone” city in a tweet. Well it’s a beautiful day here in Trump’s war zone. I’ve been to the shop & didn’t get even mildly stabbed. Now we’re nicely stocked up on tinned goods & I won’t have venture out again till Tuesday.

He’s expected to be greeted with protests. On Friday, Trump also managed to disgust the French by acting out the 2015 terror attack at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris. He used his finger as an imaginary gun and said, “They took their time and gunned them down one by one. Boom! Come over here. Boom! Come over here. Boom.” He insisted armed civilians could have stopped the attack that killed a total of 130 people. Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo blasted Trump’s comments as “contemptuous.” Former French president Francois Hollande called his remarks “shameful” and “obscene” in a tweet. Les propos honteux et les simagrées obscènes de Donald Trump en disent long sur ce qu’il pense de la France et de ses valeurs. L’amitié entre nos deux peuples ne sera pas entachée par l’irrespect et l’outrance. Toutes mes pensées vont aux victimes du 13 novembre. France’s Foreign Office said in a statement: “France expresses its firm disapproval of President Trump’s comments about the Paris attacks ... and demands that the memory of the victims be respected. France is proud to be a country where acquiring and carrying firearms is strictly regulated.”  France expresses its firm disapproval of @realDonaldTrump's remarks on the subject of the November 13, 2015 attacks in Paris, and asks that the memory of the victims be respected. https://t.co/bY6o1duBHg"
ARTS & CULTURE,"This has been a week of surreal insights. While struggling to wake up one morning, I learned that the best time and place to suffer a malware attack is in your dreams. Later that day, my neighbor showed me the bullet hole in her front window that resulted from some teenagers shooting 28 rounds while joyriding along a two-block stretch of 18th Street at 1:30 a.m. As part of a New Year's resolution to start using my recumbent exercycle again, I bought myself several seasons of Family Guy DVDs and discovered, to my utter delight, that Seth MacFarlane's writing was much snarkier in the show's first season than I had remembered. Consider the laugh-out-loud moment when Brian pulls up a chair to listen to one of Peter Griffin's rambling, nonsensical alibis and says: ""Bravo, Peter. You're the Spaulding Gray of crap!"" Having finally retired from the field of medical transcription, I've begun digitizing many of the pictures resting in my family's photo albums (some of which date back as far as 1919). One shot, taken in the fall of 1972 (shortly after my arrival in San Francisco), reminded me of the day I was hit with the sad truth about San Francisco's lingering culture clash in the years after hippiedom's heyday. As I applied for work at a temp agency specializing in office jobs, I was told to ""Dress conservative, act conservative, and remember: Power to the people!"" It's a good thing I didn't show my employment counselor this picture!
  Heading out for an evening of fun in San Francisco, Fall 1972  The recent death of David Bowie (a multi-talented, bisexual artist who had a profound impact on fashion and costume design throughout his impressive career) reminds one of the inspirational value to be found in flamboyance and performance art. As Mel Brooks would say: ""If you got it, flaunt it!  David Bowie's striped bodysuit (designed by Kansai
Yamamoto for the singer's 1973 Aladdin Sane tour)  That special, over-the-top kind of dedication to one's art was wildly on display in two recently-viewed films that were made 90 years apart. One was from the heyday of the silent film era (starring one of cinema's greatest matinée idols); the other featured two internationally-famous tango dancers looking back on careers that brought them much more professional than personal satisfaction. * * * * * * * * * * Whether bearing fearsomely masculine names like Captain William Kidd, Edward ""Blackbeard"" Teach, Bartholomew ""Black Bart"" Roberts, and Jean Lafitte or gaining notoriety as fearless women defying traditional gender roles (Ching Shih, Charlotte de Berry, Anne Bonny, Mary Read), historical pirates and buccaneers have inspired numerous narratives describing the fictional exploits of Billy Bones, The Black Corsair, Captain Blood, Captain Jack Sparrow, The Crimson Pirate, and Gertrude ""Gunpower Gertie"" Stubbs. From the 1879 premiere of Gilbert & Sullivan's beloved comic opera entitled The Pirates of Penzance; or, The Slave of Duty to Peter Pan's rowdy adventures in Neverland (where he defeated Captain Hook and a group of comically ineffectual miscreants), pirates have held a steadfast grip on the public's imagination. From such popular pirate-themed films as The Sea Hawk (1940), Long John Silver (1954), and Yellowbeard (1983) to the infamous Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, it should surprise no one that the popularity of pirate costumes and pirate customs inspired the creation of International Talk Like a Pirate Day in 1995. And, in all honesty, who could resist a pirate comedy sketch like this one? These days, few people spend their time wondering what pirate-themed movies were like back when no one could be heard shouting words like ""Avast"" ""Matey"" and ""Aaargh!""  Poster art for The Black Pirate  In December, the San Francisco Silent Film Festival launched its special event entitled A Day of Silents with a screening of 1926's The Black Pirate, starring Douglas Fairbanks as a nobleman intent on avenging his father's death by disguising himself as a pirate. As Fairbanks biographer Jeffrey Vance wrote in his program note: ""Fairbanks is resplendent as the bold buccaneer and buoyed by a production brimming with rip-roaring adventure and spiced with exceptional stunts and swordplay, including the celebrated 'sliding down the sails' sequence, arguably the most famous set piece of the entire Fairbanks treasure chest.""  In a city whose annual calendar is filled with all kinds of film festivals, it's rare to encounter a credit claiming that a film is being ""co-presented by the California Film Institute and the 826 Valencia Pirate Supply Store."" But that was part of the charm of the event. Directed by Albert Parker and shot in Two-Color Technicolor, The Black Pirate includes many stereotypical portrayals of pirates as crude, disfigured illiterates who are all too willing to let the mysterious Black Pirate show them what can be accomplished with brains. Whether swinging through the air on a rope or brandishing a sword, the athletic Fairbanks cuts a powerful figure onscreen without any need for steroids or CGI enhancements to bolster his image. His romantic scenes with Billie Dove's Princess Isobel are corny and coy, yet exquisitely cinematic. Parker made good use of supporting actors Anders Randolf as the Pirate Captain, Sam De Grasse as the Pirate Lieutenant, Donald Crisp as MacTavish, and Charles Stevens (one of Geronimo's grandchildren) as the Powder Man. However, there was never any doubt that the entire film (which packs a tremendous amount of action into 94 minutes) was carefully tailored as a showcase for the acting and athletic skills of Douglas Fairbanks. Following a brief introduction by Tracey Goessel (the author of The First King of Hollywood: The Life of Douglas Fairbanks), the screening was given a rousing accompaniment by the Alloy Orchestra. Here's the trailer: * * * * * * * * * * A fascinating documentary screened at the 2016 Berlin and Beyond Film Festival is German Kral's poignant Our Last Tango, which looks back on the careers of internationally renowned tango stars María Nieves Rego (81) and Juan Carlos Copes (84), who met in Buenos Aires when they were 14 and 17 years old. During the course of a professional partnership that lasted for nearly 50 years they starred in 1985's Tango Argentino on Broadway.  A younger dancer portrays Maria Nieves
in a scene from Our Last Tango  While their intense passions for each other ran a deep and stormy course over the years they performed together in public, their personal feelings were always overshadowed by their passion for the tango itself. Although Juan was a vain klutz when they first met, he projected the kind of masculine charm that made women swoon. Less sure of herself (but with better musical instincts), Maria quickly sensed the potential to gain a lifestyle for herself that her older sister could not envision.  Dancers from Buenos Aires rehearsing in Our Last Tango  There were problems, of course. As they head into their final years (Juan still teaches tango to younger dancers), they get to discuss the highs and lows of their personal and professional lives within a curious cinematic framework. Maria is acting as a consultant to a group of young dancers and choreographers specializing in tango who are trying to recreate the ""Copes"" style that Juan created and made famous.  A rehearsal scene from Our Last Tango  As she discusses her career with younger women, Maria explains why (especially for a dancer) there are prime years for bearing children, stressing that, in the long run, raising a family is more important than a career. Having fallen in and out of love with Juan, she is adamant that a woman should treat a man as a disposable item who can be used, abandoned, and replaced with another.  A performance scene from Our Last Tango  Kral slyly mixes archival footage of Juan and Maria in their prime with choreographed rehearsals and performances by the young dancers (some of whom are impersonating Juan and Maria) and interviews with the film's aging protagonists. Underlying it all is a great score filled with tango music. Here's the trailer: To read more of George Heymont go to My Cultural Landscape"
ARTS & CULTURE,"Since its debut in 2014, “Transparent” has brought marginalized stories to the center ― most notably, stories of queerness, transness and gender fluidity. In a talk last week at The Paley Center, creator Jill Soloway, who identifies as gender nonbinary, reiterated her show’s standing goal of “centering otherness” and allowing “queer people, trans people, women and people of color” to be protagonists in their own narratives. Through Maura, Davina, Shea, Ali and Sarah, viewers get to know human beings who are trans, queer and questioning; who are strong, courageous and loving, but can be selfish, destructive and imperfect, too.  Yet with the character of Josh, played by Jay Duplass, “Transparent” also chips away at the monolithic idea of what straight, cisgender male sexuality is. And while Hollywood surely isn’t lacking in stories revolving around white men, nuanced representations of their uncertainty, vulnerability and trauma when it comes to sex are far more rare.  Duplass describes his character, the middle Pfefferman child, as a “playboy who cries his ass off.” Internet vernacular might dub him a fuckboy, or his more sensitive sidekick, the softboy. Yet Josh’s tangled knot of emotional needs and sexual desires indicate there’s more brewing within him than shallow portrayals of a flailing womanizer suggest. With Josh, “Transparent” refuses to frame heterosexuality as the standard, simple and straightforward foil to queerness’ other. Instead, the show provides each of its characters with a fluid and ever-evolving network of desires and fears. “I think men are taught that they’re supposed to have sex with as many people as they can,” Duplass told HuffPost over the phone. “He’s learning from society what a man should be and sort of flip-flopping around the typical narratives we’re supposed to buy into.” Warning: Spoilers below for viewers still watching “Transparent” Season 3! As Josh, Duplass hopes to show that although cis, white men hold immense privilege and power, their identities are not by default established or “normal.” “I want to help every single human being be more fully themselves,” Duplass said. “If boys are allowed to cry we’d probably have a lot less war in this world. Let your boys cry, please.” And this sentiment of de-centering the straight, cis experience extends beyond what viewers see on TV. “Transparent” is as trans-inclusive backstage as onscreen, with over 50 trans cast and crew members and additional trans extras. In a rare turn, white men like Duplass were a minority on the show’s set. “I didn’t realize for a while that I was in the minority as a straight, white, cis male on set,” he said. “But I never felt otherized because, although Jill is creating an environment where trans people are put at the center, they’re not doing it to the detriment of anyone else. Because of the scene that Jill sets, we all just feel like we’re humans there to unfold ourselves and see what comes about.” Josh grew up differently than many men in America, in part because, as a kid, he was surrounded by spirited and curious women. “At the root, Josh was raised in a house full of strong women,” Duplass said. “The one person in his house he thought was a man turned out to also be a woman. It all sort of begins with this question of — what does a man do, how does a man behave? And him not having a proper role model for it.”  Josh’s first sexual experience, and seemingly his most formative one, was an affair with his babysitter, Rita, which began when Josh was 14 and Rita was 20 and persisted for years in secret. At first, Duplass hypothesized, teenage Josh was thrilled to be hooking up with a hot older woman. “In his mind, it made him the coolest kid in school,” Duplass said. Only later did he come to question the power dynamics behind the relationship and whether it is even possible for a 14-year-old boy to give consent. Legally, it’s not. “This season Josh comes to realize he was pretty much owned by Rita on some level,” Duplass said. “It started out as the thing that made him cool and, 20 years later, it’s the thing that’s imprisoning him, even though she’s deceased.” (Rita jumped to her death in a shopping mall at the end of Season 3.) In response to his adolescent relationship’s crooked power dynamics, Duplass surmises, adult Josh seeks out sexual exchanges that he can control ― he pursues music groupies who unflinchingly adore him and young women who look up to him. “What it really comes down to for Josh is that there has always been a clear power structure in his relationships, whether he is on bottom or he is on top,” Duplass said. “The Rabbi is the first time he has an age-appropriate partner and a relationship that did not have a power dynamic immediately built in.”  In the first episode of Season 4, Josh attends a sex and love addiction meeting with his sisters Sarah and Ali. An unnamed man in the circle, wearing a baseball cap and dog tag necklace, shares his story. “I’ve been thinking about my past, all the people I’ve been with and all the sex I had when I was young,” he said. “And it was mainly because people wanted to have sex with me. I wasn’t even really wanting it, but I felt like obliged to do so. And it wasn’t that I didn’t know how to say no. I felt like if my body is responding, it means yes. The thing that just occurred to me, which is going to sound weird, but it feels like a revelation: that maybe an erection is not consent.”  The revelation is radical, especially to Josh. “That’s brilliant,” he immediately responds. Just as “Transparent” chips away at hackneyed understandings of queer sexuality, so too it overturns tired notions of masculinity. Regardless of how characters identify their gender and sexuality, their wants and needs are depicted as complicated, amorphous, unfinished and in flux. There is no “normal,” and there is no “different.” We’re all, basically, beautiful messes.  Josh’s main narrative arc in Season 4 probes his relationship with Rita, specifically the question of whether or not Josh was molested. Her memory haunts his subconscious and her image follows him throughout his daily life. “So now, you’re a victim,” her ghost taunts as Josh prepares to enter the addiction meeting. It’s all happening, of course, in Josh’s mind. “The word molested, it doesn’t sit right with him. I don’t think he felt coerced at any point to have sex,” Duplass explained. “To him, the word molested is a box to be checked. It’s part of our binary culture, the way we name things.” In his adult life, Josh struggles to maintain a healthy, vulnerable, romantic relationship, though, as Duplass sees it, he fiercely yearns for one. Josh’s experience as a straight, cis man is in no way comparable to the discrimination and oppression characters like Maura face on a daily basis. However, the forces that endanger and minimize Maura’s experience might benefit Josh superficially, but not emotionally.  “I think every element of our culture deserves the ‘Transparent’ treatment, which I see more broadly as destroying the binary ― a reductive, medical checkbox rendering of humanity,” Duplass said. “Essentially binary means either/or, black or white. It pits people against each other. I think we can all be more unified and celebrated in our own ways if we just let go of the boxes that need to be checked and celebrate the complexity of the human spectrum.”  “Transparent” is available for streaming on Amazon starting Sept. 22. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"While some people continue to think of Ronald Reagan as the man who could do no wrong, those who remember his administration's participation in arms trading and union busting have a less favorable image of the 40th President of the United States. Few, however, will deny that under Reagan's watch, Americans began to experience a steady and calculated dumbing down of the educational system which resulted in surging waves of anti-intellectualism. While it may not be fair to equate brains with beauty, the sorry results speak for themselves. Those of us who read Jonathan Swift's legendary 1726 satire entitled Gulliver's Travels may recall a tribe of creatures named the Yahoos. According to Wikipedia: Swift describes them as being filthy and with unpleasant habits, resembling human beings far too closely for the liking of protagonist Lemuel Gulliver... The Yahoos are primitive creatures obsessed with 'pretty stones' they find by digging in mud, thus representing the distasteful materialism and ignorant elitism Swift encountered in Britain. Hence the term 'yahoo' has come to mean 'a crude, brutish or obscenely coarse person.' Joanne B. Freeman recently published an Op-Ed piece in The New York Times entitled The Long History of Political Idiocy. In a post entitled Willfully Ignorant Howler Monkeys on Daily Kos, diarist Sninkypoo wrote: There's no political will on the right to act with intellectual honesty and take immediate, urgent, war effort-style action on climate change. All the vast majority of politicians (left and right) want to do is get along to go along, appeal to their base, take Big Daddy Oil's money, and get reelected. Today's American politics are crippled by a combination of media-induced fear, appalling ignorance, self-hating anti-intellectualism and a strategy of aiming to please an audience that represents the lowest common denominator. As a result, our society thrives on idiotic campaign stunts like these pathetic attempts to create a viral video. A curious by-product of these ""shit-for-brains"" shenanigans is that when genuinely smart people who possess fierce and formidable intellects (Barney Frank, Bill Nye, Elizabeth Warren, Barack Obama) speak rationally, some listeners can't help but feel intimidated, insecure, irate, and impotent. Why?  Because when a person with a large and precise vocabulary can explain complex issues in reasonably simple terms, the ease and grace with which they do so makes the knuckle draggers quake in their designer shoes. It also tends to let the hot air out of pompous buffoons like Chris ""the national teachers union deserves a punch in the face"" Christie, Rick ""Oops"" Perry, and Rick (""the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the by-product of anal sex"") Santorum. John Scalzi's stunning article, Straight White Male: The Lowest Difficulty Setting There Is, offers a brilliant and beautifully written perspective on a problem currently plaguing American society. Just listen to what everyone's favorite astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson, had to say during a recent appearance in Sydney, Australia as he discussed racism and scientific illiteracy! With Republican debates filling the stage with stooges who equate their preening narcissism with wisdom, it seems as if intelligent discourse has become an endangered phenomenon. Thankfully, two new documentaries do a smashing job of reminding viewers what it's like when fearless, impassioned intellectuals not only have the courage of their convictions, but don't hesitate to speak their minds. * * * * * * * * * * Larry Kramer has been called many things (abrasive, loudmouthed, fear-mongering, obnoxious, divisive, hysterical, and dangerous) over the course of his long and prolific career as a writer and activist, but no one has ever dared to call him dull or stupid. Born on June 25, 1935 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, 2015 has been a banner year for one of the LGBT community's most lauded elders.  Larry Kramer at his 80th birthday celebration  Considering his long history of health problems (an AIDS diagnosis, a liver transplant), turning 80 was a milestone Kramer couldn't always be confident that he would reach. There has never been any doubt, however, about his achievements as a writer and public scold.  David Webster and Larry Kramer  Larry Kramer: In Love & Anger opens with its protagonist's famous ""Plague"" speech. From there on, its powerful sweep offers a crash course in how Kramer's response to the AIDS crisis helped to change the way new medical treatments were made available to the public by the National Institutes of Health. It also shows how ACT-UP's infamous ""die-ins"" (including a protest at St. Patrick's Cathedral) succeeded in drawing media attention to a spurned segment of the population who, as they faced death, had nothing left to lose. While the documentary shows Kramer in robust health and, later in life, as a frail senior citizen, it teaches viewers what can happen when one fiercely intelligent man (who is not willing to take ""no"" for an answer) speaks truth to power. Here's the trailer: * * * * * * * * * * If one ventures into the political wars that now dominate cable television, it often seems as if the level of discourse has sunk to that of a professional wrestling match. People (especially when the screen is divided up among various pundits) are so busy talking over each other's voices that they can't be bothered to listen to what's actually being said. From the morally reprehensible Mike Huckabee to the perverse insanity of Ann Coulter; from the preening narcissism of Donald Trump to the clumsy cluelessness of Jeb! Bush, today's political news scene has deteriorated into a toxic sideshow in which the most reliable truth tellers have been comedians like Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Bill Maher, Lewis Black, and John Fugelsang. A fascinating new documentary by Robert Gordon and Morgan Neville looks back at how the personal and political rancor shared by two intellectuals snobs helped to develop the antagonistic formats that have become so familiar to today's television viewers.  Poster art for Best of Enemies  Back in 1968, when there were only three major networks (no cable), ABC's ratings were in the toilet. Faced with the challenges of covering that year's Republican National Convention in Miami Beach and the Democratic National Convention in Chicago (which was ruled with an iron fist by Mayor Richard J. Daley), ABC's corporate executives hit on a novel idea. Why not get two political commentators to debate each other on air during the conventions? Their final choice was bound to be an incendiary pairing. William F. Buckley, Jr. initially grabbed the public's attention in 1951 with the publication of his first book (God and Man at Yale) when he was only 25 years old. Having founded National Review magazine in 1955, Buckley would eventually write more than 50 books (including several espionage novels). A conservative Christian with a monstrous ego, his sneering condescension was impossible to ignore. In 1948, Gore Vidal's depiction of a homosexual relationship between characters in his third novel (The City and the Pillar) shocked many readers. His love of history and politics led to the creation of such plays as The Best Man (1960), Romulus (1962), and An Evening With Richard Nixon and.... (1972).  His historical novels (including Julian, Burr, 1876, The Golden Age, and Lincoln) stand in sharp contrast to his wildly imaginative 1968 satire, Myra Breckenridge. As filmmaker Robert Gordon notes: I was a kid during their 1968 tête-à-tête offensives. Bill Buckley's Firing Line was broadcast on Sunday mornings, what we watched when there were no cartoons and only preachers.  A master of the medium,  he engaged children with his mannerisms and adults with his ideas. Vidal was a man of the left, his historical novels lining all modern home libraries; apart from the movement but also a part of it, he was the nation's historian, and also its augur.  Decades later, in 2010, my friend Tom Graves obtained a bootlegged copy of their 1968 debates and he screened them at a museum. The audience stayed long after the last image, parsing the performances and the issues.    Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley, Jr. get made up for a
television appearance in a scene from The Best of Enemies No one today speaks like these men, but their confrontations ring so contemporary. In the focused light of the 1968 national television camera, the seeds are planted for our present media landscape, when the spectacle trumps the content of argument.  Each side today, like these two men, sees the other as malignant, promulgating views catastrophic for America; strident partisanship is virile patriotism and compromise is castration. These Vidal-Buckley debates forecast the present state of civic discourse, when heated and abbreviated by camera lights and corporate sponsors.  William F. Buckley, Jr. and Gore Vidal
in a scene from The Best of Enemies I was intimidated to enter the world of Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley. A great part of this film's initial attraction was the depth and breadth of these two huge characters, and of their luxurious language.  Their sense of theater makes their knowledge entertaining, and their enmity sizzles like a fireworks fuse. Their East Coast WASP confidence, their easy command of the classics, the masterful rhetoric -- it makes a southern boy feel so unschooled. No matter what a viewer's age may be, watching Best of Enemies offers a fascinating display of two tart-tongued elitists debating each other with fangs bared and no love lost between them. Think of it as a cage match in which each contestant must rely on his cultural literacy, searing wit, and huge vocabulary in order to win. By an odd coincidence, this documentary about the Buckley-Gore debates was released at the same time as Jen Lancaster's fourth novel (The Best of Enemies).

BUSINESS,"More than a year has passed since Chipotle Mexican Grill was hit with a series of food safety scares, but the fast-casual chain has yet to bounce back from its problems. In 2015, Chipotle faced a series of outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, including an E. coli outbreak that spread across nine states, a salmonella outbreak in Minnesota and two separate instances of norovirus. The crisis scared customers away and prompted big changes in the company’s approach to food safety in its restaurants. But many customers haven’t returned. In response to still-disappointing sales in the company’s most recent quarter, Chipotle executives claimed in a conference call with investors last month that its struggles have more to do with customer-service issues — long lines, messy dining rooms, ingredient shortages — than with lingering concerns over the safety of its food, according to a Washington Post report. A new HuffPost/YouGov poll complicates that narrative. The poll, conducted from Dec. 21-22, found that just 36 percent of respondents said they were confident that the food served at Chipotle is safe to eat, while 24 percent of respondents said they were not confident in the food’s safety. Another 40 percent said they were unsure. The lack of confidence in the safety of Chipotle’s food outpaced the 14 percent of respondents who said they were not confident that the food served in most restaurants is safe to eat. When respondents were specifically asked if they believed Chipotle was either safer or less safe to eat at than most other restaurants, 21 percent of respondents said they believed eating at Chipotle was less safe. That number remained consistent even when the sample was narrowed to include just respondents who say they are customers of the chain, 20 percent of whom also agreed that the food at Chipotle is less safe than food at other restaurants. These findings suggest that a significant number of Chipotle customers still have concerns connected to the company’s food safety scares. In a statement provided to HuffPost, Chipotle chief marketing and development officer Mark Crumpacker disputed that assessment, stating that the company’s extensive internal research has shown that brand trust and admiration have essentially recovered to pre-crisis levels. The lagging sales, Crumpacker reiterated, are due to customers’ less frequent visits — not an outright avoidance. The company believes subpar customer experiences at some of the chain’s locations is to blame. “The bottom line here is that there are many intertwined and complex reasons why we have not fully recovered our sales,” Crumpacker added, “but the main reason is that our customers are not yet as frequent as they once were, not because they are concerned about food safety.” For his part, food safety expert and frequent Chipotle critic Doug Powell said he believes the company is “grappling” as it places blame for its slow recovery away from its food safety struggles. “I’m not sure they’re focusing on the basics,” Powell, a former Kansas State University food safety professor and the publisher and editor of Barfblog, told HuffPost. “Whether it’s food safety or employee retention or whatever it is.” Though the cause of Chipotle’s slow rebound might be debatable, the chain’s feeble sales numbers are not. The restaurant’s sales have continued their sag over the past four quarters and shares of the stock tumbled 6 percent last month when Chipotle CEO and founder Steve Ells, who was named sole CEO of the restaurant in December, admitted he was “nervous” about whether the chain will achieve a previously forecast uptick in sales in 2017. Shares of the stock have since rebounded, but the chain’s outlook still remains uncertain. The company is set to announce its fourth quarter and full year 2016 sales numbers on Feb. 2.

BUSINESS,"Since September is Intergeneration Month, take time to appreciate the richness that comes with the collaboration of wise and young minds. Intergenerational Month is a global movement celebrating the benefits of relationships between adults aged 60+ and young people. It also raises awareness about societal changes that create the need for mindfully uniting generations. Each generation has its own vocabulary, preferred resources, and behavioral norms. Now that the number of Millennials has surpassed the Baby Boomers as the United State’s largest living population, it behooves business professionals of all generations to consider these tips for a seamless intergenerational workplace. Dear Millennials, Use Social Media… Wisely. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat―your social media expertise is important. Don’t refrain from using these platforms; they are the communication of the future. Do be cautious about content. Even if your personal instagram account is set to private, consider omitting your surname and creating a second, more polished account to connect with colleagues. Potential employers look at social media; depending on the position or license, passwords can be requested. Speak with Eloquence. Millennials are often criticized and disqualified for their casual vocabulary. In the office, watch your diction. Trade the “W.T.F.” or “O.M.G.” uttered around friends with a more sophisticated “Oh my!” or “Goodness!” Reflect on your word choice. You don’t want to be called “entitled”; Baby Boomers don’t want to be called “outdated.” Respect formal office culture. You may prefer to be addressed by your first name, but don’t assume the same goes for your colleagues. Address senior colleagues by their last name, until they invite you to do otherwise. Respect Success & Proven Methods. While your idea of information sharing encompasses texting, Snapchat, and Google drive, keep an open mind. Your experienced colleagues may use a variety of communication methods, including phone calls, email, and may occasionally prefer reading paper documents to analyze layout. If you and a colleague’s ideas on communication methods clash, step back and observe. Humility and respect make an impact in business, especially with Boomers. Avoid assuming that you are always right and newer technology’s always better. Before explaining why you prefer your method, seek to understand the other positions first. Remember, it isn’t about you - it’s about business. Your coworkers have excellent reasons for their approach. Be a team player. Find a compromise. Dear Baby Boomers, Test the Waters of Social Media. Many Boomers already use various social media accounts, but if you haven’t started, begin with LinkedIn―a social media platform designed for business professionals. Consider creating Facebook and Twitter accounts for modern information sharing. 70% of millennials get their news from Facebook. Consider asking a younger coworker for insight on trending hashtags or Moments on Twitter. Listen―to Others and to Yourself. It may be challenging when a colleague 20 years your junior is using terms with which you’re unfamiliar. Remember that each generation develops their own set of terms and phrases reflecting modern culture and technology. Pay attention to both these new words and your own terminology. Avoid calling coworkers “sweetheart” and saying phrases such as, “you wouldn’t remember this, but…” This terminology may make your colleague feel uncomfortable. Keep an Open Mind. Age diversity in the workplace fosters collaboration of seasoned experts and dynamic alternative-thinkers. Avoid judging a colleague’s work or ideas based on their age. Those new to the business world may arrive with revolutionary ideas, so be open to conversing about change. As more millennials enter the workforce and more baby boomers choose to postpone retirement, encourage yourself to throw away age-based stereotypes and to continue seeking new perspectives.

ARTS & CULTURE,"The greatest technology for a creative person is neither an app nor a device, it is paper. As we begin the new year, I wanted to share this analog system with you which I created called The Creativity Notebook, so that it can transform your world the way it has mine. As a working artist and mother, I am constantly searching for different methods to increase my productivity and to enhance my life. I love technology. I’m a longtime subscriber to Lifehacker, use Trello and I couldn’t function without Google Docs. But when it comes to capturing ideas, lists and making appointments on a device, I risk falling into the black hole of news, email or social updates that we all do. I tried and found every form of note-taking, list-tracking app a productivity killer and a time waster. An artist’s greatest asset is uninterrupted time. I had to invent a system that would give me more and enhance the creative process, not detract from it. There is no creativity without productivity. The connection between paper and creativity is well-documented. I tried other “analog” systems but found them overwrought. I needed something simple, inspiring and action-oriented all in one. As a painter, entrepreneur and founding arts editor of this online newspaper, it is essential that I stay organized. I started with a sketchbook and this is how The Creativity Notebook was born. The Creativity Notebook: The Front Half The first half of the Creativity Notebook is a simple Segregated Notes and Action Items section with thoughts/notes/sketches on the left and the action items on the right. When either side is full, migrate only the uncompleted tasks only to the righthand side of the next spread. The tactile experience of re-writing incomplete tasks reinforces their need to get done. This working method catapulted my productivity to a whole new level. People always ask me “When do you find the time?” This is how. The Creativity Notebook also becomes an incredible chronological file because, if somebody asks, “What was it that we discussed in that meeting months ago?” I only need to flip backwards to find the notes in my handy notebook. Incorporating a Datebook The back half of the Creativity Notebook is a 52 week calendar section. It involves a simple binder brass clip as a toggle and art by either me or you.  The binder clip is essential component.  By putting the datebook on the back, only past dates and future blank note pages are under the clip. All relevant notes and future dates are always accessible outside the clip. All I have to do is move the clip to the right and exactly on the current date. It is the perfect combination — a datebook, a notebook, a sketchbook and an idea book all in one. I experimented with every kind of paper notebook and found that certain subtleties make huge differences. Unlined/Uncoated Paper I want no borders to hem my ideas in so it had to be unlined. Furthermore, the texture of uncoated paper reunites me with a more primitive self and connects me to everyone who has ever held a writing instrument on parchment throughout time. It feels organic and real. The binding must not just lie flat but block out one side altogether. Creative Notebooks need to have the functionality that enables pure focus. Different Art for Every Week Because of our sensitivity to visual input, I created suggestive art that still has usable margins as a key feature. Just seeing a color, line, poem, quote or a shape of any kind differentiates each week. Associating different art with every week creates visual scaffolding and anchors the pleasure of planning. In the past, when I bought art-centric datebook from museum shops, I was limited to one artist’s work which I couldn’t write on, no margins to participate in with paper too smooth and too thick. Such books are also too heavy to carry around in order for it to function in lieu of a device. Unlike the Week-at-a-Glance system, where the week is spread across two pages, I needed a vertical structure stacked day structure with the morning activities under the sun and evening activities under the moon to make it easier to avoid over planning too many evenings in a row. Downtime is essential for creative minds.  This subtle difference made a huge impact on how I created uninterrupted time and a rhythms in my week.  One year I tried no art and two vertically structured weeks side by side and instead of making me more productive, the lack of art stressed me out and space for each week.  It only reinforced the need for art. I developed The Creativity Notebook over several years to heighten my productivity, inspire me creatively and as a tool to avoid reaching for my device all throughout the day. It has truly changed my life. I’m excited about presenting it to the public for the first time. Yes, it means that everywhere you go, you will carry around a notebook that has all your thoughts, drawings, tasks and calendar in one place. You already carry keys, a wallet and a piece of metal and glass that is known and scientifically-proven to yank you away from your thoughts. Based on the people who I have already given it to, I know you will treasure as it is your own work of art.   I am currently offering two editions which are handcrafted in my studio in Venice, California: Signed Limited Artist Edition of 100. Each book has a 52 week spread, Calendars for 2017–19 and approximately 50 spreads for the segregated note systems. All notebooks measure 5.5 x 8 inches, 120 plus pages.   I have been beta-testing it with numerous artists, writers and entrepreneurs in California and they all tell me how it has streamlined so much of what they do and they treasure it.  I would love to share this revolutionary new application with you. TheCreativityNotebook.com — - Kimberly Brooks is a painter.

BUSINESS,"Six months after acquiring Whole Foods, Amazon (AMZN) is working on reorganizing Whole Foods shelves by first adding Amazon private label products and, soon, it may add popular consumer packaged goods like Coca-Cola. Behind the scenes, this is causing internal debate and disagreements, Yahoo Finance has learned. When asked if Whole Foods will add “consumer packaged goods like Coca-Cola,” Whole Foods spokesperson Brooke Buchanan said, “As you know, we have really high-quality standards, and those products that you just mentioned don’t meet those quality standards. If there were new products that actually do meet our quality standards, then there’s always that consideration.” Amazon declined to comment. In June, Whole Foods CEO John Mackey called the marriage with Amazon, “love at first sight.” And the two appear to be in a happy union, with one big announcement after another: price cuts on staples; Amazon Echo devices debuting in stores; and recent free delivery on Whole Foods products for Prime members. But the honeymoon may be over as Amazon and Whole Foods butt heads over what to stock store shelves with. Would adding Coke sacrifice the healthy, organic image Whole Foods has long held dear? Whole Foods has been known for its strict rules on sourcing products, requiring foods “free of artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats,” according to its website. That rules out Coca-Cola, the household product with artificial preservatives in the secret recipe, and even its healthier diet version. Amazon’s plan to change Whole Foods’ shelves is a key effort of the e-commerce giant’s initiative to make Whole Foods profitable. Whole Foods same-store sales had been falling for eight consecutive quarters before being bought by Amazon. After Amazon’s takeover, Whole Foods reported a 4.4% increase in sales for the quarter ending Sept. 24, 2017 from a year earlier — the biggest in two years. While Whole Foods gained an almost cult-like following, it has also been criticized for its limited store offerings, even as retailers like Walmart and Costco have started to sell more organic produce. Whole Foods owns just a 4% share in the total U.S. grocery market, a far cry from Walmart’s 25% and Kroger’s 10%, according to a Susquehanna analyst note last June. Then Amazon came. As a consumer-centric company, Amazon is leveraging Whole Foods to satisfy customer needs. That has become more urgent after Amazon provides free delivery of Whole Foods groceries for Prime members, who have a large appetite for packaged goods like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo snacks. “Whole Foods has proved a specialty retailer focusing only on organic food can’t scale and be profitable,” says Brittain Ladd, a retail and supply chain consultant. “Amazon doesn’t want to maintain the status quo. They can’t see people go elsewhere simply because these highly-popular products are not available in Whole Foods.” Amazon could add private label products as soon as March, but the plan of bringing in consumer-packaged goods still faces obstacles from Whole Foods, according to sources familiar with the matter. “If that does ever happen, it will upset a lot of team members and customers,” a longtime Whole Foods store employee in Austin told Yahoo Finance. “That’s what makes Whole Foods Market different from our competitors.” But food makers have already started providing healthy alternatives of its products for the Whole Foods. Last year, Bloomberg reported PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay developed organic Doritos marketed under the name “Simply,” which meet all the criteria needed to be sold in Whole Foods. Industry experts said Whole Foods will eventually benefit from larger store selections, since many packaged goods have higher margins and a strong customer base. “It’s painful, but Whole Foods needs to be put out of the comfort zone,” Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail told Yahoo Finance. “There are retailers that can provide high-quality organic food while offer packaged goods, and Amazon is helping Whole Foods in that direction.” Do you think Whole Foods should carry more consumer packaged goods?

BUSINESS,"Andrew Luccock pays about $1,700 per month for health insurance for his family of 5 — and still expects to pay more than $25,000 out-of-pocket this year for medical care. That will total around $45,000 for premiums and uncovered expenses in 2018 – on top of a similar outlay last year. “I’m angry. I feel trapped,” the 58-year-old insurance broker form Portland, Ore., tells Yahoo Finance. “I have enough cash flow coming in, but I keeping thinking, how does a normal person pay for this?” Congress fought some epic battles over health care during the last year — and in the end did precisely nothing to help a slice of Americans struggling with soaring health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. The Trump administration, meanwhile, killed a subsidy associated with the Affordable Care Act, raising costs even more for those already facing the sharpest increases. The most crushing price hikes are hitting people who don’t get insurance from an employer or government program, and purchase it individually on the so-called non-group market. These over-the-barrel consumers tend to be small-business owners or independent contractors, and the steepest premiums hit those between 50 and 64. For people getting insurance through an employer, premiums rose just 3 percent in 2017 on average, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. But premiums for individual policies rose a whopping 20 percent, and premium increases in 2018 may very well surpass last year’s. That’s happening for a couple of reasons. First, many insurers participating in the marketplaces set up under the Affordable Care Act set premiums too low when the law first went into effect in 2014. They’ve since adjusted upward, with sharp hikes in premiums for some customers. There are rules limiting premium increases under Obamacare itself, and big employers have negotiating leverage that helps keep a lid on the premiums their workers pay. But purchasers in the non-group market have hardly any leverage, so insurers have shifted the biggest price hikes there. President Trump’s decision last October to end “cost-sharing reduction” payments to insurers probably pushed premiums up even more, since insurers had to find additional ways to offset rising costs. Again, raising premiums on individual policy purchasers is the path of least resistance. Complete data for 2018 isn’t available yet, but Kaiser found likely premium increases ranging from 17 percent for a low-cost plan offering modest coverage to 32 percent for a medium-priced plan that covers more. Obamacare, as the ACA is known, provides subsidies for lower-income people buying insurance through an exchange, so they don’t feel the full sting of higher premiums. But people who earn too much to qualify for subsidies have no such protection, and end up bearing the full brunt of all the price hikes insurers are loading onto individual purchasers. There are about 10 million Americans covered by plans purchased on the individual market without ACA subsidies. Yahoo Finance surveyed more than 1,400 readers on their insurance costs from Jan. 12 – 15, and found more pain among people purchasing individual policies than those covered by any other source. More than 58 percent of people buying individual coverage said the cost was unaffordable or a major hardship, compared with just 43 percent overall. And 91 percent of those purchasing an individual policy said premiums went up this year, compared with just 78 percent of all respondents. Luccock, who buys insurance on the individual market, started seeing substantial price hikes in 2017, after his prior insurer pulled out of Oregon, unable to turn a sufficient profit. Monthly premiums rose from $1,050 per month to $1,350 under the new insurer, and then to $1,700 for 2018. Luccock’s 23-year-old son injured his back in 2016, requiring two medical procedures last year. But insurance would only pay for one, forcing Luccock to pay more than $40,000 out of pocket for the other. He paid half upfront last year, with the rest due this year. Since Luccock is an insurance broker who understands how the market works, he’s contemplating alternatives to traditional insurance. “I’m thinking I could put $4,000 or $5,000 a month into an investment account and eventually be able to cover most medical expenses myself,” Luccock says. “In the worst case, if something terrible happened, I’d just go bankrupt. How crazy is it for somebody like me to even contemplate self-insuring?” Others are giving up on insurance altogether. Mark Viator, a retired statistician living in Crofton, Md., had been buying insurance on the individual market since he left a government job in 2005. But with his premiums due to rise 40 percent from 2016 to 2017, he decided to go without. “That’s just an astonishing rate of growth,” he says. “That stunned me. For me, it’s the costs being out of control.” Viator, 61, has a condition that will require some orthopedic work on his hand, but he figures he’ll negotiate a cash price with doctors — and otherwise simply wait it out until he qualifies for Medicare in 4 years. Brian, a 60-year-old business owner who lives near Ft. Lauderdale, is also looking ahead to the moment he qualifies for Medicare — but with a lot more trepidation. His wife suffers from multiple sclerosis and requires costly medication, so going without insurance isn’t an option. Monthly premiums for the two of them have risen from about $1,800 per month in 2014 to $3,140 per month this year — a 74 percent increase during that time, or 19 percent per year. Including deductibles, the cost of insurance is about $31,000 per year. “That’s a crazy amount of money,” says Brian, who asked that we not use his last name. Paying that much for insurance leaves less to put into retirement funds or invest back in his business, and fellow business owners he knows face the same crunch. “We don’t have any buying power as a group,” Brian says. “We feel like we’re underheard and underrepresented. Nobody talks about it any more.” The big fight in Congress last year wasn’t about solving the problem of runaway costs that millions of Americans face. That battle was strictly about killing Obamacare, which would have checked a Republican wish-list item but also would have axed insurance for millions, while doing little to rein in costs. Three Republican-led efforts to kill Obamcare failed. Obamacare is, in fact, partly to blame for the predicament individual insurance buyers face. By establishing minimum coverage levels and phasing out subsidies at certain income levels, the 2010 law left an island of consumers in the individual market uniquely vulnerable to rising costs. But the law also did a lot of good, and repealing it outright would leave 20 million people or so without insurance. The Trump administration made two changes last year that will probably affect insurance and medical costs in the future — but not favorably. The tax cuts President Trump signed in December included a repeal of the individual mandate requiring all Americans who can afford health insurance to purchase it. That will save money for people who choose not to buy insurance, provided they don’t get sick or hurt. But it will probably push premiums even higher for individual insurance purchasers, because there will be fewer healthy people in the insurance pool and a larger portion of sick people requiring costly care. Inevitably, those hikes in premiums and out-of-pocket costs will flow to the individual market. Trump also plans to allow the sale of “association health plans,” which tend to offer stripped-down benefits at a lower cost than typical plans. That could lower costs for some, but these plans are controversial because they’ve been associated with fraud in the past. They could also siphon off healthy consumers from broader insurance pools, which, again, would push rates higher for those who remain. There are better ways to address spiraling costs. The U.S. system is riddled with middlemen and incentives that reward the amount of care provided, rather than the effectiveness of care. There are many sound ideas for how to better control costs, if Congress were interested in real solutions. The government could even provide last-resort catastrophic care to those who can’t afford a traditional policy but want minimal coverage in case of disaster—an idea once backed by conservative icon Milton Friedman, but rejected now by conservatives seemingly opposed to any government role in anything. For the time being, meanwhile, health reform in the United States is more likely to go backward than forward. Confidential tip line: rickjnewman@yahoo.com. Encrypted communication available.

ARTS & CULTURE,"
 Czech writer Milan Kundera poses in a garden in Prague in 1973. (AFP/AFP/Getty Images)  What do we make of a bad book, written late-career, by an acclaimed author?  With a whiff of schadenfreude, some revel in the literary hero’s fall from grace. Others avert their eyes, saddened that a great artist failed to move them as he or she once did. In either case, the book is more than a book. It has become intertwined with the writer’s cultural legacy and personal history. Milan Kundera’s new novel, The Festival of Insignificance, is one of these late-career bad books. With a startling relish, writers from The New York Times and The Guardian have denounced the slim hundred-pager as out-of-touch, sexist, and, worst of all, banal. Praise, when it comes, remains glancing. A New Republic piece calls it “more bagatelle than concerto, more ramble through the park than expedition to scale lofty peaks,” while an LA Times review recommends we read the book as mere “epilogue.”  In a sense, they’re right. The Festival of Insignificance is a far cry from Kundera’s classic The Unbearable Lightness of Being, which combined lyrical excellence and philosophical weight to great effect in 1984. The new book, on the other hand, tracks five trifling characters as they play pranks, tell anecdotes about Stalin, and ruminate on navels. When a failed actor speaks ""Pakistani"" to feed his performance bug, the ploy strikes as quirky rather than profound. “Insignificance, my friend, is the essence of existence,” summarizes a character at the book’s end.  For fiction, it’s a thesis told in too few words. Yet there’s good reason to ponder Kundera’s book. Not destined to be a masterpiece, it nevertheless remains ripe for a different sort of analysis: one that fits the “bagatelle” into Kundera’s literary narrative, recognizing that an “epilogue” cannot be understood without the preceding text. His, after all, is a knotted history. It began with the ardently anti-communist The Joke in 1967, shed its political bent after The Unbearable Lightness of Being, then switched languages from Czech to French after 1990 -- a decade after Kundera had emigrated to France.   If a shallow late-novel recalls and complicates those decades of depth, is it really so shallow? It’s disappointing that so few of the reviews have dug into the philosophical meat of The Festival of Insignificance -- because it diverges so drastically from earlier Kundera works. Compare, for instance, its title with that of The Unbearable Lightness of Being. The 1984 classic tracked the motifs of lightness and heaviness, complicating the assumption that heavy things -- tragedies, heartache, angst -- were negative. Heaviness was painful, yes, but it also lent meaning to existence. It’s difficult to lapse into nihilism when there are pressing issues like political catastrophe to attend to. Lightness, the characters found out, was the truly awful condition. Though it seemed attractive to float serenely through the world without care, ease turned quickly to apathy, then became unbearable.  Then we have The Festival of Insignificance: a complete embrace of the lightness Kundera once seemed to reject. Life, the new characters contend, is insignificant, so we might as well make it a spectacle. Instead of forging meaning through layered memories, relationships, and objects, these Parisians find solace in what Hegel called “unendliche Wohlgemutheit” -- an infinite good mood in which even the worst atrocities seem hilarious.  Back in The Joke, humor was no laughing matter. When the protagonist quips wittily, “Optimism is the opium of the people,” he spells his doom in a repressive communist regime. But fast forward 50 years in Kundera’s oeuvre, and the stakes are reversed. In the latest book, Stalin becomes the excuse for a joke about urination; instead of leaving us vulnerable to totalitarianism, laughter dances above it. These are fascinating departures, almost complete reversals. Why, we must ask, has a novelist of ideas so radically changed his own? Perhaps it is a question of nationality. Did Kundera discover lightness when he left behind his homeland, opting for the very life of garden strolls and party antics that consume the insufferable Parisians in the new novel? When Kundera rejected his Czech heritage -- asking that all his works be reclassified as French Literature -- was he breaking with his homeland’s political gravitas? Or perhaps it is a matter of age. Has Kundera arrived -- after a lifetime of grappling with heaviness, identity, and meaning -- at the conclusion that insignificance is our best foundation for life? “We’ve known for a long time that it was no longer possible to overturn this world, nor reshape it, nor head off its dangerous headlong rush,” ruminates one of the characters in The Festival of Insignificance, “There’s been only one possible resistance: to not take it seriously.” Time can breed cynicism, and Kundera seems to have arrived at humor as the only option in a jaded world.   These modes of reading are a far cry from normal review protocol, which tends to judge each book on its own, isolated terms. But Kundera’s late novel cannot help but drum up associations with the past 50 years. Readers and critics will inevitably contextualize it with political and personal details, and that’s not necessarily a problem. In a recent NPR piece, Saeed Jones explored the question of how to view Toni Morrison’s Gold Help the Children, a late-career novel much like Kundera’s. Morrison’s new work is similarly sparse and pared down -- as if she’s withholding the full, thundering force that captivated readers in Beloved or Paradise. Yet, Jones points out, the book still means volumes to us. It interlocks with the thematics of beauty, slavery, and mother-daughter relations Morrison has spent a life-time exploring -- so each passage calls up layers of symbolic meaning. An image that would flow quickly from our minds if penned by another author is instead captured and savored because we have a Morrison foundation to receive it.  The Festival of Insignificance operates in a similar vein. Its lightness is heavy with the weight of previous Kundera books, so a Stalin reference blooms with additional meaning -- because it’s been set so strikingly against previous portrayals of communism. This is a very different model for thinking of literature; it rests less on the individual merit of a book and more on how it connects to a broader network of meaning. Academics sometimes call this “intertextuality”: examining the relationships between texts, delving into the network’s depth. If that seems to be letting authors off too easily -- letting them sit on their laurels and produce paltry works -- we would do well to revisit The Unbearable Lightness of Being. One of the novel’s central preoccupations, after all, is the formation of meaning through layered memories:   ""Each time the same object would give rise to a new meaning, though all former meanings would resonate (like an echo, like a parade of echoes) together with the new one. Each new experience would resound, each time enriching the harmony."" If we take Kundera to be the object, even a banal “new experience” will summon all those old echoes. The harmony resounds just a bit more richly, and The Festival of Insignificance becomes a parade of echoes. It’s a perfect metaphor for reading novels of this sort -- and a fact Kundera seems to have known all along. In a few weeks, Harper Lee will release Go Set a Watchman, a book that will inevitably fail to live up to its predecessor but that need not be written off. Broadening our mindset -- fitting the novel into a larger textual legacy -- may not redeem it. But that mindset can, at least, provide a stimulating exercise, a more productive and respectful way to think about the late works of the greats.  For then they will become, like the reunion of two lovers in Kundera’s famed novel, “a recapitulation of time, a hymn to their common past, a sentimental summary of an unsentimental story that was disappearing in the distance.”"
ENTERTAINMENT,"No matter how much time you spend watching Netflix every week, the streaming service wants you to watch more.  One way the company is doing this is by spending billions on acquiring and creating the best shows and movies out there. That’s great and offers real cultural value. Another way Netflix does this is by using extremely complex algorithms and subtle marketing features to trick you into watching more... and more... and more. That’s not so great if you value your free time and don’t want to waste your precious hours on this planet watching subpar shows and movies. You’re almost definitely well aware that Netflix programs episodes to autostart when the previous episode finishes, thus increasing the chance you get locked into an unintentional binge. That’s the kind of obvious product choice that you can spot and avoid if you want to. Yet there are a few other tricks the company employs that you might not have noticed yet. Netflix is also very open about these “tricks.” The company documents product rollouts extensively on various company blogs you can read for yourself.  The Streamline mission is to help you make better and more intentional choices of what to stream, rather than waste your time with mediocre content. Hopefully, becoming aware of these subtle tricks will help you. In any case, read about the tricks below. And if you want to stay informed about the best things that are joining Netflix on a weekly basis (because Streamline does, in fact, love Netflix), make sure to subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.  This is part of Streamline, HuffPost’s weekly recommendation service for streaming shows and movies. Every Saturday, Streamline ranks the best shows to watch online, including a focus on Netflix.    Back in the early days of the Netflix streaming platform, the service would show you the actual promotional posters for the various shows and movies it offered. Later, Netflix decided those recommendations would be better with custom pictures. This initial customization decision fixed a couple of problems: Netflix could start using horizontal photos that allow for bigger typeface and design variance. The images could also show character faces more clearly than just hoping the movie posters were good. There are a lot of bad movie posters out there or at least plenty that don’t look great as small images on a television, laptop or smartphone screen. So this move by Netflix made sense. In December 2017, Netflix announced that the customization would get fancier, by offering different promotional images to users based on that specific user’s tastes. As seen in the example photo above provided in Netflix’s announcement, the service will try to make you think a show or movie is just like the other shows and movies you like. The photo example focuses on variants of comedy fandom. If you’re a fan of classic comedies and there’s a famous comedian in a particular project, Netflix will show you a picture of that person. If you’re more a fan of romantic comedies, then Netflix will show you two characters from the project that might be in love. For an important Netflix Original rollout like the latest season of “Stranger Things,” Netflix made many different custom images to appeal to different users. You can see a few of them in the image at the very top of this article. On Feb. 7, Netflix announced that the company now uses an algorithm to comb through shows and movies to find the perfect promotional stills given different marketing requirements. Basically, this Netflix algorithm will find stills of character close-ups in some sort of emotional moment. And then eventually another Netflix algorithm decides which characters to market to you (such as the famous comedian or the couple from the example before). Presumably the algorithms will just get more and more powerful until every show and movie on your homepage looks like something you’d want to check out.  This is far from a Netflix specific trick. Marketing designers have long used font choices to distinguish products from each other.  But given Netflix’s extremely large catalogue of original shows and movies, it’s worth noting how the company uses font to make everything seem unique. Back in March, the data visualization website Venngage explored the connection between Netflix’s font choices and user psychology. The Venngage team essentially pulled a ton of data on Netflix font selections and then showed that Netflix is putting nuanced care into this design element. Pretty much every Netflix show has its own original font. Even a blockbuster like “Avatar” famously just used the maligned font “Papyrus.” Although the use of customized fonts might seem like a small thing, Netflix’s special attention here exemplifies that the company is trying to use every advantage it can to get you to click on more content. The decorative “Glow” font or the handwritten “Love” font or the mystical “Ozark” font might have been the final push you needed to click on those shows. Those rows of recommendations on your Netflix homepage are way, way, way more customized than you probably thought. And the company is constantly experimenting with what to recommend to you. Netflix explained the case for the “rows” concept in 2015. Understanding this technique is a good starting point for comprehending the homepage customization in general. The Netflix announcement from 2015 described it well, so here’s the relevant paragraph: By presenting coherent groups of videos in a row, providing a meaningful name for each row, and presenting rows in a useful order, members can quickly decide whether a whole set of videos in a row is likely to contain something that they are interested in watching. This allows members to either dive deeper and look for more videos in the theme or to skip them and look at another row. This would not be the case if, for example, the page contained a large, unorganized collection of relevant videos. So “rows” are Netflix’s organizing principal. And as you can guess, customization can easily be achieved by showing an “action” fan a row of action movies. As you’ve probably noticed, Netflix tends to offer genre rows that are far more specific than “action” though. So a user could get a “Cerebral TV Shows” row or “Irreverent Rant Stand-Up Comedy.” (There’s even secret codes you can use to find these lists, as pointed out by The Daily Dot.) But the Netflix customization gets far more nuanced than even that. One such way is a process Netflix explained in 2017 as “interleaving.”  Basically this process allows for a more scalpel-esque approach to gathering data on what you want to watch. Instead of just gathering the data that you’re watching a “Cerebral TV Show,” Netflix is running multiple tests within that given row. This is definitely confusing, so here’s an attempt at a simplified example: While you see one row of content on the homepage with one label (such as “Top Picks” for you) the Netflix algorithm has actually hidden various, even more nuanced rows of options in the same row. Therefore, it seems that multiple subsets of, say, the “Cerebral TV Show” concept are actually in that row you perceive to be just one thing. And then if you consistently choose one particular secret subset, the whole row will shift to giving you more from that particular algorithmic recommendation. Long story short: The algorithm is very far past a simple “user likes action movies / show more action movies” setup. If you thought you could use this row to choose something that would be a part of the zeitgeist, you’ll likely be disappointed. Netflix rolled out a “Trending Now” row in 2015. At the time, the company explained that the name isn’t exactly true. Instead of just presenting the shows and movies that are actually trending the most at any given moment, Netflix is still customizing for you personally. This is just one more way to get you to keep watching things in your own rabbit hole of personal taste. And the “Trending Now” row only makes you think that you’re connecting to a larger community. Of course, there still is some truth to the “Trending” moniker. For example, as holiday-themed shows and movies gain steam around the respective holidays, these titles tend to appear in this row. The row is basically a snapshot of what you’re most likely to want to watch right now. The answer to that will be different from user to user. But occasionally when megahits like “Stranger Things” debut a new season, the tastes of many users will align.  This is perhaps the most hated feature about Netflix’s homepage. “Current favorite console game: navigating Netflix without triggering autoplay promos,” director Rian Johnson (“Star Wars: The Last Jedi”) tweeted back in March. That tweet got over 31,000 likes. But Netflix clearly has some data that autoplaying trailers are causing you to watch more shows and movies, and so this terrible feature persists. The autoplaying trailers on the homepage debuted back in 2016. These don’t tend to happen on a desktop and were originally designed for Netflix homepages on Roku, video game consoles and smart TVs. This distinction is important because, on these platforms, the cursor is always selected on some show or movie by default. And then after about a second, the trailer begins on the selected item. On a desktop with a mouse cursor, nothing in particular is ever selected and therefore the autoplaying would be all over the place. The rollout announcement explained that these videos were just one more way that Netflix could try and convince you to watch something new. (A video in the announcement (embedded above) had the promotional tagline, “So you can browse less... and watch more.”) The goal is to explicitly trick you to “watch more.” Don’t weigh your options. Don’t get off the couch and do something else. Keep watching Netflix. I’m including this one as a bonus as it’s more just something I’ve noticed than a “trick” with hard evidence. But the marketing department at Netflix is phenomenal. And marketing that makes bad things seem like good things is arguably the most impressive trick of all. Netflix clearly spends considerable resources in the promotional phase to make sure the Netflix Originals all look like they could be amazing. It’s usually fairly easy to discern from a trailer or poster if a movie or show is going to be trash, but Netflix has a knack for making just about every single trailer and poster compelling. There have been countless posters for Netflix Originals that have been beautiful works of art and then the actual content has been bad. (See the “Mute” example above as that movie earned a 15% on Rotten Tomatoes.) You really can’t tell whether something is actually going to be worth your time from any Netflix promotional material. I, for one, keep getting excited about Netflix projects I shouldn’t be caring about at all. I just hope I can someday figure out how to stop getting tricked by Netflix. Until then, I’ll just keep streaming and hoping I’m getting Netflix’s best."
ARTS & CULTURE,"From a reporter who’s dedicated her career to documenting segregation in America’s education system, to one of the first computer scientists to hack an automobile, to an artist who doubles as a counter-surveillance researcher, this year’s roster of MacArthur Fellows celebrates yet another year of exceptional human achievement. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation announced the latest recipients of its annual MacArthur Fellowship ― frequently referred to as the “Genius Grant” ― early Wednesday morning. Nikole Hannah-Jones, Stefan Savage and Trevor Paglen are but three members of an impressive class of 2017 fellows, newly endowed with a $625,000 check and an accolade previously attached to icons like Susan Sontag, astrophysicist Joseph Taylor and musical tour de force Lin-Manuel Miranda. The MacArthur Foundation began doling out grants in 1981 in an effort to identify and extol high-achieving individuals in a wide range of disciplines. (The 2017 list of grantees counts a painter, immunologist, human rights strategist, urban planner and novelist among its two dozen-deep roster.) The once-$50,000 award has since ballooned into the six-figure, “no strings attached” grant we know today. There are no restrictions governing what recipients do with their fellowship bounty. This year, the fellows include nine women, 14 men and one gender-non-conforming individual, ranging in age from 33 to 63. See the entire list of new “geniuses” below. For more MacArthur Fellowship coverage, check out our interviews with grantees Rhiannon Giddens and Viet Thanh Nguyen. Jesmyn Ward is a 40-year-old fiction writer based in New Orleans, Louisiana, whose stories bring black, marginalized communities to the center. Her three novels, including Salvage the Bones (2011) and Sing, Unburied, Sing (2017), address brutal and often ignored realities including poverty, racism, addiction and incarceration with honesty, affection and rigor.  Gabriel Victora is a 40-year-old immunologist working in New York City. He adapted and perfected cellular imaging methods to better visualize the process through which adaptive immunity develops. His analysis of B cells yielded “the most definitive evidence to date that affinity maturation of antibodies occurs in a manner akin to Darwinian evolution,” a previously hypothesized but not ultimately proven conclusion that will benefit the creation of new and more potent vaccines.  Tyshawn Sorey is a 37-year-old multi-instrumentalist, composer, performer and conductor in Middletown, Connecticut. His singular practice straddles the line between improvisation and composition, collapsing boundaries between genres and traditions including Western classical, American and Ethiopian creative expressions, resulting in experimental, avant-garde arrangements that test the limits of musical performance.  Yuval Sharon is a 37-year-old director and producer of opera whose unorthodox performances ― often immersive and itinerant ― challenge the predominant understanding of what opera can be. His 2014 piece Hopscotch: A Mobile Opera for 24 Cars, took place in and around Los Angeles, with audience members commuting in limousines as singers and musicians emerged at various locations ― and within the vehicles themselves ― to tell a dynamic story within a living city.  Stefan Savage is a 48-year-old computer scientist whose interdisciplinary techniques address cybersecurity in the age of “smart” devices. Based in LaJolla, California, Savage recently demonstrated how an automobile could be hacked remotely and began working with car manufacturers to reduce security threats. His research in internet-related crimes, and the technological and cultural blindspots that enable them, prove critical in today’s constantly evolving technology landscape.  Damon Rich is a 42-year-old designer and urban planner whose strategies uproot the systems of oppression and discrimination embedded in cities’ layouts through predicaments like division, gentrification and environmental injustice. The Newark, New Jersey-based planner is known for his clever and sometimes witty approach to the field, as evidenced in his 2009 book Red Lines Housing Crisis Learning Center, which used the Queens Museum’s 1,000-square-foot representation of New York City to visualize the foreclosure crisis. His work invites citizens who are often disenfranchised to the forefront of conversations about urban design, bringing democracy to the city space. Derek Peterson is a 46-year-old historian and professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he studies and preserves East African texts, specifically in Gikuyu and Swahili, to challenge predominant narratives regarding colonialism and nationalism in Africa. Peterson’s research incorporates an unrivaled array of written materials, ranging from diaries and religious pamphlets to syllabi and dictionaries, which speak to the interplay of motivations, perspectives, traditions and contexts at play in these often overlooked materials.  Betsy Levy Paluck is a 39-year-old research psychologist at Princeton University concerned with destructive patterns of human behavior, including discrimination, bullying and ethnic conflict. Paluck’s field research, which has taken her from American high schools to post-conflict Rwanda, determined that, as the MacArthur Foundation describes, “to change behavior, it is more important to target individuals’ perceptions of social norms than their personal beliefs.” Trevor Paglen is a 43-year-old, Berlin-based conceptual artist and geographer who uses public records and declassified documents as artistic materials, exposing the alarming grip military and corporate power possess in today’s climate of mass surveillance. His practice includes the establishing of “limit telephotography,” which uses high-power telescopes and cameras to photograph secret prisons and military bases. Kate Orff is a 45-year-old landscape architect and founding principal of SCAPE, a Manhattan-based urban design studio that believes in urban landscapes’ ability to revive ecosystems, adapt to the difficulties posed by climate change and connect individuals. Orff collaborates with ecologists, engineers, educators, artists and community members to draw attention to the natural histories of specific regions, whether through infrastructure initiatives or podcast tours.  Viet Thanh Nguyen is a 45-year-old writer, cultural critic and University of Southern California professor who uses fiction to provide a “voice to the voiceless,” specifically by humanizing underrepresented minorities. His 2015 novel The Sympathizer is a spy thriller told from the perspective of a communist double agent in and after the Vietnam War. His stories offer alternative understandings of well-trodden American war stories, where marginalized voices are often obscured and erased.  Rami Nashashibi is a 45-year-old community leader and the executive director of the Inner-City Muslim Action Network (IMAN). The organization, based in Chicago’s South Side, works to provide health and wellness services, community organizing, criminal justice reform, arts enrichment and other services to low income residents. His Muslim Run Corner Store Campaign brought a wider selection of healthy foods to overlooked neighborhoods and eased racial tensions between the predominately Arab immigrant store owners and black patrons.  Taylor Mac is a 44-year-old, New York-based theater artist ― and at times a playwright, performance artist, actor and all three at once. Mac, who uses the gender pronoun judy, breaks down distinctions between highbrow and lowbrow art to toy with cultural assumptions about gender, performance and identity. judy’s 24-hour piece “A 24-Decade History of Popular Music” (2014–2016), explores the history of American popular music through a queer lens, highlighting the instances in which pop culture innovations have emerged as weapons against intolerance and injustice. Cristina Jiménez Moreta is a 33-year-old social justice organizer, as well as the co-founder and the executive director of United We Dream, a nationwide network dedicated to helping immigrant families based in Washington, D.C. Moreta came to the United States from Ecuador as a 13-year-old undocumented immigrant. She has since worked to put young people at the forefront of a strategic effort to challenge the stigmas undocumented youth face and enact the policy changes necessary to protect them from deportation and offer a pathway to citizenship.  Rhiannon Giddens is a 40-year-old singer, instrumentalist, songwriter, musical historian and activist based in Greensboro, North Carolina. Having trained as an opera singer before mastering the fiddle and five-string banjo, Giddens illuminates the overlooked influence of African-American artists to genres like folk and country. “I’m really interested in shining a light on those aspects of musical history that have been traditionally neglected and left behind,” she told the MacArthur Foundation. “Because I feel that our current situation can be explained by what’s going on culturally in years past that hasn’t been addressed.”  Nikole Hannah-Jones is a 41-year-old investigative journalist for The New York Times Magazine who often explores the effects of segregation on the American education system. Her work, including the 2016 article “Choosing a School for My Daughter in a Segregated City”, combines historical research and political analysis with first-person accounts, bringing the persistent reality of systemic racism and its pernicious effect on children and communities into sharp focus. Jason De León is an anthropologist at the University of Michigan who combines ethnographic analysis, forensic science and archaeological research in his work studying migration from Latin America to the United States. His 2015 book The Land of Open Graves: Living and Dying on the Migrant Trail, investigates the approximately 300 people a year who die attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, often with no identification or belongings on their person. The work explores who they are, how they die and what happens to them afterward.  Emmanuel Candès is a 47-year-old applied mathematician and statistician at Stanford University. His research, as explained by The MacArthur Foundation, “focuses on reconstructing high-resolution images from small numbers of random measurements, as well as recovering the missing entries in massive data tables.” Candès compared the technique, which is applicable in fields from diagnostic healthcare to radar imaging, to inferring a customer’s Netflix preferences from the limited assortment of movies she views and rates. Dawoud Bey is a 63-year-old photographer and educator who creates deeply engaging portraits of individuals from overlooked communities and reimagines how cultural institutions can better serve the communities in which they are based. In 2013, the Chicago-based artist created “The Birmingham Project,” a photo series paying tribute to the six children killed in the 1963 bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church and its aftermath in Birmingham, Alabama. His more recent series, “Harlem Redux,” explores the transformative effects of gentrification on the historic black neighborhood.   Regina Barzilay is a 46-year-old computational linguist at the department of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. Barzilay develops machine learning methods that enable machines to interpret human language and perform useful tasks. “One day machines can communicate with us in the same way we communicate with each other,” she told the MacArthur Foundation. Barzilay is currently exploring how machine learning can apply to the field of oncology, specifically in identifying trends that affect early diagnosis, treatment and disease prevention. Annie Baker is a 36-year-old playwright, based in New York, known for upending expectations of what kinds of people, language and situations are worthy of theatrical interpretation. Her 2009 production “Circle Mirror Transformation” takes place in a community acting class, in which five budding actors participate in exercises that illuminate elements of their interior selves. In 2010′s “The Aliens,” three amateur songwriters get high next to a dumpster, communicating primarily not through language but physical tics and cues.  Greg Asbed is a human rights strategist and a co-founder of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers and Fair Food Program (CIW) in Immokalee, Florida. For decades, the CIW has fought to improve conditions for low-wage workers and provide protections from sexual assault, wage theft and other abuses in the workplace. With his approach, dubbed worker-driven social responsibility (WSR), which has already spread from crop industries in Florida to the dairy industry in Vermont and garment industry in Bangladesh, he hopes to transform workplaces around the world.  Sunil Amrith is a 38-year-old historian in the department of South Asian studies at Harvard University. He studies migration in South and Southeast Asia, particularly in relation to the movement of people and goods across the Bay of Bengal, which has occurred for centuries and continues to impact culture to this day. His 2013 book Crossing the Bay of Bengal examines how climate and environment shape the lives of ordinary Indians, and his upcoming work will delve into how climate change ― specifically monsoons ― continue to alter South and Southeast Asian history. Njideka Akunyili Crosby is a 32-year-old figurative painter, born in Nigeria and based in Los Angeles, whose work combines techniques, media and subjects to visualize the hybrid reality of the immigrant experience. Crosby’s multimedia paintings invite viewers into her own intimate world, introducing them to her home and her family, to capture the global story of existing in between boundaries, cultures and traditions. At once accessible and incredibly dense, Crosby’s images offer textured representations of spaces, people and lives that fold in multiple perspectives and defy simple categorization.   Check out the 2016 class of MacArthur Fellows here."
ARTS & CULTURE,"  Snøhetta expansion of the new SFMOMA. Photo: © Iwan Baan, courtesy SFMOMA. Art + Tech: Strategies for the Digital Age at the #newSFMOMA ""I am the love child of people who love art and people who love tech,"" announces a sultry voice in my ear. This is how the new SFMOMA mobile app defines itself. Combining geolocating technology with immersive audio tours, the iOS app claims to represent ""a new breed of museum app experience,"" and is one of the forward-looking methods through which San Francisco Museum of Modern Art is distinguishing its new identity, and inaugurating its new building. To anyone who has observed the changes occurring in the San Francisco Bay Area in the wake of the tech boom, the fact that SFMOMA is embracing a new core of digital engagement strategies as one of the primary identifying features in its re-launch should come as no surprise. Charles Schwab, the Chair of SFMOMA's Board of Trustees, announced it at the press preview as ""a museum for the age of sharing.""  The new SFMOMA, view from Yerba Buena Gardens. Photo: © Henrik Kam, courtesy SFMOMA.. SFMOMA, which re-opens to the public on May 14, 2016, has been closed for nearly three years. The museum didn't disappear entirely during this time; it went ""On The Go,"" mounting exhibitions and staging events at other venues. Yet while the museum was undergoing the construction of a $305 million expansion, adding 100,000 square feet of gallery space to its building and a distinctive new entity to the San Francisco skyline, the city around it was undergoing massive changes, too. In 2013, the construction cranes over SFMOMA joined the multitude of others building up the downtown landscape with new luxury apartment buildings in a seismic socioeconomic and cultural shift already in process, as an influx of wealth from the burgeoning Silicon Valley-based tech industry threatened the vibrant mix and unique character of the city. San Francisco was becoming ""Googlized, stripped of artists, minorities, and the non-rich,"" as one observer put it at the time.

Personally, after spending a few years away from San Francisco, the transformation is startling--in appearance and in culture. Relentless development and gentrification has taken root all over the city. On my Uber ride over to SFMOMA's press preview I shared the car with two other passengers who never once looked up from their phones. How does one engage this new kind of audience?  German Art after 1960: The Fisher Collection exhibition at SFMOMA. Photo: © Iwan Baan, courtesy SFMOMA. The new SFMOMA is optimistic it can reach out to a digital-driven public. ""Digital tools can strengthen the connection between art and people,"" SFMOMA Director Neal Benezra stated, as he introduced the museum's digital program, which includes interactive media installed in various interpretive galleries and other displays. The centerpiece of the program is the app, which detects the viewer's location in the museum, triggering audio programming related to the artwork the viewer is standing next to, or simply identifying where the nearest bathroom is. (No human interaction necessary.) The technology allows for an audio tour experience that is seamless and immersive. Notable and unexpected voices guide the viewer through unique and personal takes of the museum: Avery Trufelman of the architecture radio program 99% Invisible leads a tour of the new architectural features of the building; high-wire walker Philippe Petit leads a tour encouraging the viewer to run through the museum; a German woman leads the viewer on an emotional journey through the galleries of Anselm Kiefer and Gerhard Richter. In addition, there are hundreds of individual recorded responses to the artwork on view, with commentary by artists, composers, comedians, and many others. ""We saw that audio tours have this great potential,"" Erica Gangsei, head of SFMOMA's Interpretive Media department, explained to me, ""it's like having your favorite podcast in your ear.""

Along with the complementary digital content and interpretation, new media art infuses many of SFMOMA's inaugural exhibitions, with video and screen-based works by Matthew Barney, Rivane Neuenschwander, and Owen Kydd among the painting, sculpture, and photography sections. The seventh floor of the new building contains the Media Arts galleries, where the museum demonstrates its longstanding dedication to time-based media, sound- and computer-based artwork with an exhibition, Film as Place, featuring an early video installation by Beryl Korot, a film by Jananne Al-Ani, and Julia Scher's Predictive Engineering (1993-2016), an installation of surveillance cameras and video feeds.  Laura Hyunjhee Kim at SFMOMA. Courtesy of the artist. Photo: Jenny Sharaf. It was in Scher's surveillance installation where I encountered a group of local artists, documenting themselves interacting with the artwork. San Francisco-based new media artist Laura Hyunjhee Kim was wearing a wolf mask and making noises into a microphone connected to the surveillance installation, while Oakland-based artist and electronic musician Ricardo Saavedra recorded the proceedings along with San Francisco-based artists Jenny Sharaf and Cara Rose DeFabio. As Kim explained to me, the artists were invited to the museum's press preview day to ""document something special and spontaneous at SFMOMA geared towards the social media audience.""  As an artist whose practice is deeply involved in digital technology, and as a resident of San Francisco, Laura Hyunjhee Kim has first-hand experience with both sides of the tech boom in the Bay Area.  It is something that has prompted the closures of art spaces and the mass relocation of many artists out of the Bay Area, while also providing fodder and inspiration for her work. It provides a somewhat strange and isolating environment. ""I sometimes do forget that I live in a socio-cultural tech bubble,"" she admits. While there have been detrimental effects to the local arts community due to the influx of tech capital, Kim has also seen how it has brought the remaining artists together and ""fueled the arts community to be more creative and experimental utilizing alternative spaces.""

While artists keep their tenuous hold on the city, a wave of new commercial art spaces has accompanied the imminent re-opening of SFMOMA. As SFMOMA looks to the tech community as a source of new potential patrons and museum-goers, commercial galleries are also chasing tech-industry wealth: Gagosian and John Berggruen are opening new galleries adjacent to the museum; Pace recently opened up a gallery right in the heart of Silicon Valley's Palo Alto; and Minnesota Street Project aims to create a vital urban center of commercial galleries and studio space in the Dogpatch district. ""In theory, more commercial art and spaces that sell art is great!"" says Kim, ""However, how many of the artists residing within the city benefit from this? It is not for everyone."" A sustainable art ecology is an elusive but important goal in the Bay Area, one perhaps only achieved through the cooperation of people who love art, and people who love tech.

ENTERTAINMENT,"Winter Olympics skating star Adam Rippon took his skills to the ballroom Monday on the “Dancing With The Stars” premiere ― and the transition was no problem. Rippon and partner Jenna Johnson earned the highest score of the night (24) with a vogueing cha cha to RuPaul’s “Sissy That Walk.” “You were born to do this show,” panelist Carrie Ann Inaba told the bronze medalist afterward. Can’t say we disagree. Check out their routine here: Among others advancing in the athletes-only competition were Tonya Harding (getting crowd support from Allison Janney, who won an Oscar for playing Harding’s mom in the movie, “I, Tonya”) and basketball great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Let’s remember that the NBA Hall of Famer is 71 years old and well over 7 feet tall. Respect. Snowboarder Jamie Anderson and retired baseball player Johnny Damon got the heave-ho."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Imagine walking into a seemingly abandoned house on a desolate, urban block, and finding it covered wall-to-ceiling in dahlias, roses, hydrangeas and sunflowers. A florist in Detroit will make that vision a reality this fall.  Lisa Waud, proprietor of Pot & Box, will create the ""Flower House"" during a four-day span in October. She and a group of florists will transform the 17 rooms, including porches, of a vacant duplex with countless American-grown flowers. Photo of the Flower House by Heather Saunders. The installation will be open to the public for just a weekend. Then, it will wilt and the house will be deconstructed, leaving no trace of the Flower House -- except for a flower farm that will be cultivated on the properties in coming years.  Photo of the Flower House by Heather Saunders. The idea took root when Waud saw photos of a 2012 Christian Dior fashion show that used a backdrop created from one million flowers.  “I’m joking that I knew something was going to happen, because I didn’t think, ‘How did they do that?’” Waud told The Huffington Post. “I thought, ‘How can I do that? I have to do that.’” She was particularly moved by one photograph of a model taking in her surroundings.   “The look on her face, looking around at these flowers, was just in disbelief at how beautiful, how massive it is,” Waud said. “I want it be that kind of breathtaking experience.” Photo of the Flower House by Heather Saunders. Waud was left to figure out how she could create a similar transportive environment. She eventually settled on using a copious local ""resource"" -- abandoned houses -- and in September purchased two adjacent properties for $250 each from the city of Hamtramck, a small enclave within Detroit’s borders. She believes the houses haven’t been lived in for a decade.  One, which has a two-room commercial storefront, will be used for a preview in May so florists can test ideas and introduce their vision to potential partners. Photo of house next to the Flower House by Heather Saunders. The specifics of the installation still need to be nailed down, but Waud can picture the broad strokes. She named the large-scale work of Christo and Jeanne Claude as an inspiration during a recent interview on a floral podcast.  “I want each room to just feel kind of absurd,” she explained to HuffPost. “I don’t want it to feel wedding-y; a lot of us revert to that because that’s what we do for our work. I want it to feel contemporary.” Photo of the Flower House by Heather Saunders. Waud thinks of her houses as more lifelike than a blank canvas, saying they feel ""lonely"" and ""a little sad."" She hopes “they might enjoy” the experience of being used again. “I’m really fascinated with the kind of the juxtaposition of these old houses that haven’t seen much activity, and then getting this kind of flurry of color and life and people,” she said. “It touches on abandoned house reuse in Detroit and thinking about not just reusing the buildings and the land, but what can happen on the way.” Photo at the Flower House site by Heather Saunders. During the Flower House’s brief bloom, there are five slots open for private events. In May, applications will be available for those openings, as well as several remaining rooms in need of designers.  Waud says the project will rely heavily on flower donations, and will also hold a crowdfunding campaign in spring to cover the costs of other supplies.

ENTERTAINMENT,"Movies about talking animals are typically innocuous, if not entirely forgettable (except, of course, if your name is Paddington), but “Show Dogs,” which hit theaters on Friday, has sparked criticism from parents and advocacy groups. The film follows Max, a police dog (voiced by Ludacris) that infiltrates the world of elite dog shows alongside a human FBI agent (Will Arnett) to recover a kidnapped panda.  Some viewers have taken issue with multiple moments in the film when the canine’s genitals are touched in preparation for the final show ― first by Arnett’s character and later by judges, even though he’s clearly uncomfortable.  In these scenes, Max is told to go to a “zen place” while the inspection occurs, which, according to the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, sends “a troubling message that grooms children for sexual abuse.” The nonprofit group released a statement condemning the messaging of the film, which is rated PG, given the age group of its intended viewers.  “Disturbingly, these are similar tactics child abusers use when grooming children — telling them to pretend they are somewhere else, and that they will get a reward for withstanding their discomfort,” Dawn Hawkins, the group’s executive director, said in a statement. “Children’s movies must be held to a higher standard, and must teach children bodily autonomy, the ability to say ‘no’ and safety, not confusing messages endorsing unwanted genital touching.” The NCOSE has called on the filmmakers and studio to halt the distribution of the film until it’s recut without the objectionable scenes.  Concerned parents have also taken to social media to share their reactions to the film and warn others about the scenes in question. Some have called on the actors to speak up about the issue.  I'm sure many people will feel that #parents are being too over-the-top about skipping #ShowDogs, but kids soak in what they see. When I preach that their body is theirs alone, why would I sit & laugh at a movie implying it's OK/funny to ""grin and bare"" inappropriate touching? Please do not take your children to see #showdogs movie. It teaches children that touching of privates is okay and to go to a ""zen place"" when it happens. Child sex abuse is real. This is not okay. #showdogsmovie @arnettwill Is the #Metoo movement going to have rallies and call for a boycott of @ShowDogsMov? Do they not care about children who are victims of pedophilia, or children who could be because #ShowDogs tells kids to accept being inappropriately touched? In response, Global Road Entertainment, the studio behind the film, has defended the scenes as a commonplace practice in these kinds of competitions.  “The dog show judging in this film is depicted completely accurately as done at shows around the world, and was performed by professional and highly respected dog show judges,” it said in a statement to CNN. “Global Roads Entertainment and the filmmakers are saddened and apologize to any parent who feels the scene sends a message other than a comedic moment in the film, with no hidden or ulterior meaning, but respect their right to react to any piece of content.” A writer for the film, Max Botkin, however, has since spoken out about the backlash, seemingly siding with concerned parties over the material.  “I absolutely condemn any suggestion or act of non-consensual touching in any form, as well as disassociation as a coping mechanism for abuse of any kind,” he said in a statement. “I understand and empathize with the parents’ and groups’ concerns regarding the message the movie may impart.” UPDATE: In response to the backlash, Global Roads Entertainment has decided to recut the film without the controversial scenes for a nationwide release this weekend.  “Responding to concerns raised by moviegoers and some specific organizations, Global Road Entertainment has decided to remove two scenes from the film Show Dogs that some have deemed not appropriate for children,” the studio said in a statement to Entertainment Weekly. “The company takes these matters very seriously and remains committed to providing quality entertainment for the intended audiences based on the film’s rating. We apologize to anybody who feels the original version of Show Dogs sent an inappropriate message. The revised version of the film will be available for viewing nationwide starting this weekend.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,"  Ishiuchi Miyako, Frida by Ishiuchi #34, 2012-2015. © Ishiuchi Miyako. Courtesy Michael Hoppen Gallery. Of all the important artists of the modern era, Frida Kahlo's work is perhaps the most inseparable from her biography and her unique physical appearance. Her life and art are presently interpreted in three exhibitions--in New York, London, and Mexico City--through the objects she surrounded herself with or used to adorn her body. By studying Kahlo's personal effects and the environment she immersed herself in, can we learn anything new about the artist we know so well? Do these objects reveal something about her daily reality that her stoic visage belies? Followers of the Kahlo-cult won't be disappointed with these three exhibitions of her artifacts, which aim to deepen our understanding of her relationship to life and death, pain and beauty, and her enduring love of Mexico.  A reimagined version of Kahlo's garden at the Casa Azul (Blue House), ""FRIDA KAHLO: Art, Garden, Life,"" installation view, 2015. Courtesy of the New York Botanical Garden. Photo: Ivo M. Vermeulen. ""Frida Kahlo: Art, Garden, Life,"" curated by art historian Adriana Zavala at the New York Botanical Garden, celebrates Kahlo's love of nature in this summer blockbuster exhibition. Walls painted an intense azure blue complemented with accents of terra cotta evoke Kahlo's lifelong home, known as the Casa Azul, in the Coyoacán suburb of Mexico City. In the Garden's conservatory, cacti, succulents, and colorful marigolds take center stage on a brightly painted pyramid, a scale model of the one at Casa Azul that Diego Rivera used to display his collection of pre-Columbian sculpture. Calla lilies, sunflowers, ivy, palms, and other types of flowers and plants that Kahlo painted, and pinned in her plaited hair, appear in abundance. In a small gallery in the library of the Botanical Garden, fourteen of Kahlo's paintings and works on paper are also on display, focusing in particular on her still life paintings, which abound with melons, citrus, cactus fruits, and sometimes birds or other animals.  ""FRIDA KAHLO: Art, Garden, Life,"" installation view, 2015. Courtesy of the New York Botanical Garden. Photo: Robert Benson. ""Art, Garden, Life"" is verdant and succulent, an unabashed celebration of Kahlo's iconic art and likeness, and of Mexican culture in general. ""Frida al Fresco"" evenings bring live music, cocktails, and Mexican dining to the Botanical Garden; ""Frida's Flora and Fauna"" leads children and families on a scavenger hunt for botanical specimens; and ""Cooking with Frida"" demonstrations teach visitors how to prepare Mexican cuisine. Kahlo felt an intense connection to Mexico--in the years she spent abroad in the United States and France, she complained bitterly of homesickness--and particularly to the Casa Azul, whose surroundings and lush plant life loom in the background of many of her paintings.  An evocation of Frida Kahlo's studio overlooking her garden, ""FRIDA KAHLO: Art, Garden, Life,"" installation view, 2015. Courtesy of the New York Botanical Garden. Photo: Ivo M. Vermeulen. Frida Kahlo began and ended her life within the confines of the Casa Azul. It was at Casa Azul--as Kahlo lay convalescing from the traumatic trolley accident she endured at the age of 18 that would haunt her for the rest of her life--where she first began to paint. It was at Casa Azul where she and Rivera entertained countless Mexican and international artists, poets, and intellectuals. And it was at Casa Azul where Kahlo died, in 1954, at the age of 47. Her ashes rest in an urn in one of the rooms on the upper floor. After Kahlo's death, Rivera placed her personal belongings--her clothes, jewelry, medical supplies, and other items--out of view, in a bathroom of the Casa Azul, which was to stay sealed until 15 years after his death. Rivera died in 1957. The room, however, remained shut until 2004.  Ishiuchi Miyako, Frida by Ishiuchi #2, 2012-2015. © Ishiuchi Miyako. Courtesy Michael Hoppen Gallery. At Casa Azul, now the Frida Kahlo Museum, the items that were locked away for so many years are now on display in a long-term exhibition entitled ""Appearances Can Be Deceiving: Frida Kahlo's Wardrobe."" Her many Tehuana dresses bear witness to her fierce sense of Mexicanidad, while invoking, as curator Circe Henestrosa argues, the image of the powerful women of the matriarchal Tehuantepec region. The long skirts also benefitted Kahlo in that they disguised her infirmities: her withered right leg, the result of a bout of polio she contracted at the age of six; and the effects of that devastating traffic accident, wherein her spine was broken in three places, her uterus pierced through, and her foot crushed. The lasting trauma from the accident would prevent Kahlo from ever bearing children, and forced her to wear orthopedic braces and corsets to support her spine, particularly later in life as she became increasingly weak. These corsets and prosthetics, along with her dresses, costumes, jewelry, and other items displayed throughout five rooms of the museum, demonstrate how Kahlo went about constructing her identity. The exhibition's title originates from a drawing by Kahlo showing her frail, buttressed body, disguised by the voluminous folds of her skirts and shawls.  Ishiuchi Miyako, Frida by Ishiuchi #36, 2012-2015. © Ishiuchi Miyako. Courtesy Michael Hoppen Gallery. The objects, prosthetics, and adornments through which Kahlo transformed herself hold a striking power. Japanese artist Ishiuchi Miyako, invited by Henestrosa to document Kahlo's secret wardrobe when it was opened at last, captured these objects in an extraordinary series of photographs, on view now at Michael Hoppen Gallery in London. Ishiuchi's photographs have garnered an immense response from a worldwide audience. These photographs, simply styled and elegant, seem to translate so effectively the character of Frida Kahlo--her shimmering vitality, her independence, her coquettish style, and her resilience in the face of pain and trauma. The prosthetic leg she had fashioned, after her right leg was amputated near the end of her life, reveals a defiant pair of jingle bells. A wretched old cast she wore over her torso, embellished with circular mirrors, illustrations, and a prominent hammer and sickle symbol, demonstrates her allegiance to Communism as well as a healthy dose of surrealism.  Ishiuchi Miyako, Frida by Ishiuchi #100, 2012-2015. © Ishiuchi Miyako. Courtesy Michael Hoppen Gallery. Ishiuchi Miyako is adept at conveying through photography the inherent memory of objects. In previous projects, Mother's (2000-2005) and Hiroshima (2007-ongoing), Ishiuchi takes as her subject worn garments evoking absent bodies, some of them victims of the horrific nuclear attacks of World War II. While Ishiuchi knew very little about Frida Kahlo before documenting her wardrobe, she came to be acquainted with the artist through the traces left behind on her personal belongings. The remarkable, magnetic energy of these items is vibrantly clear in her photographs, from the abundant, heavy folds of Kahlo's Tehuana skirts, to the delicate, moth-eaten fabric of a swimming costume. In one photograph, a pair of long black gloves stretches slender fingers outwards, grasping and ghostly.  Ishiuchi Miyako, Frida by Ishiuchi #86, 2012-2015. © Ishiuchi Miyako. Courtesy Michael Hoppen Gallery. Although interpreting an artist's work through her life and personal items gives us an incomplete view--appearances can be deceiving--these displays of Kahlo's relics and passions reveal facets of her constructed identity, and show that her love of life, nature, and Mexico, and her battle with disability, death, and trauma, were intrinsically and vitally connected.

ENTERTAINMENT,"Reason No. 3489543 to stan Ariana Grande: The pop star typically isn’t one to clap back or respond to rumors on social media, but a tweet from a fan must’ve seriously rubbed her the wrong way. On Wednesday, Grande, who recently split with rapper Mac Miller, issued a lengthy response to a follower who called the celebrity breakup “heartbreaking,” given Miller’s legal troubles of late.  Days after their split, Miller was charged with DUI and hit and run after police said he struck a power pole and fled the scene in California’s San Fernando Valley. According to TMZ, the rapper blew twice the legal limit when authorities arrested him later at this home.  “Mac Miller totalling his G wagon and getting a DUI after Ariana Grande dumped him for another dude after he poured his heart out on a ten song album to her called the divine feminine is just the most heartbreaking thing happening in Hollywood,” the fan wrote on Twitter.  Cue Grande with the classiest comeback we’ve seen in a while.  pic.twitter.com/1GPM6smsBu “How absurd that you minimize female self-respect and self-worth by saying someone should stay in a toxic relationship because he wrote an album about them, which btw isn’t the case,” she wrote. “I am not a babysitter or a mother and no woman should feel that they need to be.” The “No Tears Left To Cry” singer went onto note that she’s been taking care of Miller for years, but never revealed “how hard or scary” things became.  “Shaming/blaming women for a man’s inability to keep his shit together is a very major problem. let’s please stop doing that,” she added. “I will continue to pray from the bottom of my heart that he figures it all out and that any other women in this position does as well.” The fan later issued a lengthy apology to Grande, explaining that he never intended to blame her for Miller’s “shortcomings.” Grande responded in kind, thanking him for “hearing” her. thank you for hearing me, i appreciate your response v much. ☁️ sending u love. Grande this month addressed reports that she and Miller had split, calling “The Way” collaborator “one of my best friends in the whole world.” “I respect and adore him endlessly and am grateful to have him in my life in any form, at all times regardless of how our relationship changes or what the universe holds for each of us,” she wrote on social media alongside a picture of the couple in happier times.  After Miller’s arrest, Grande shared a cryptic tweet on social media, writing, “pls take care of yourself.” She’s since been linked to “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson, and the two may or may not have matching tattoos. "
POLITICS,"President Donald Trump did his best to explain why the U.S. needs lax gun control laws by re-enacting the November 2015 terror attacks in Paris during a speech Friday before the National Rifle Association. So the president reenacted the Bataclan shooting during his speech at the NRA convention... pic.twitter.com/ypBaddy7qK “So let’s talk about guns, shall we?” Trump said to the NRA crowd in Dallas. France has strict gun control laws, the president said, and that’s why terrorists were able to kill 130 people and injure hundreds more on Nov. 13 three years ago. “We all remember more than 130 people,” Trump said of the attacks. “Two hundred and fifty people had horrible, horrible wounds. I mean, they never mention that, but they died in a restaurant and various other close-proximity places.” The majority of those killed were shot at the Bataclan theater during a rock concert. In case people have forgotten the carnage of that day, Trump then used finger guns to really drive his point home. “They took their time and gunned them down one-by-one,” Trump claimed about the terrorists’ shooting style. “Boom. Come over here. Boom. Come over here. Boom.” Trump also brought up the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead earlier this year. He called for the arming of teachers as a way to prevent more such tragedies. Meanwhile, guns were banned at the NRA event because the Secret Service thinks that’s a better way to protect the president. The worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history ― last October in Las Vegas when 58 people were killed and more than 800 more were injured ― did not come up in Trump’s remarks. The culprit was a U.S. citizen who was able to stockpile an arsenal of guns and ammo that he then unleashed on a music festival crowd from a high position at the Mandalay Bay Hotel. The millions of Americans affected by gun violence ― not to mention the Parisians who were slaughtered in 2015 ― deserve more empathy than Trump showed on Friday. But few should be surprised by his lack of it."
ARTS & CULTURE,"How could photos of cute dogs swimming get any better? When they’re shelter dogs learning pool safety, duh. Photographer and animal advocate Seth Casteel released a new set of photos this week from from a January swimming lesson he held with dogs up for adoption at animal rescue group spcaLA. TV network Z Living took their own photos of the lesson to promote Casteel’s new show, “Finding Fido,”  which focuses on “matchmaking” people with adoptable dogs. Though Casteel does swim with dogs on the show, this particular lesson isn’t featured in the series. Casteel, who has been photographing pets since around 2007, rocketed to fame in 2012, when his captivating shots of dogs swimming underwater went viral online. Through taking photos of dogs in the water, Casteel came to realize that though most dogs instinctively know how to “doggie paddle” when they get in the water, many canines still need some instruction in water safety. In particular, dogs can be confused by swimming pools, since they’re more difficult to exit than say, a lake. “The dog has to understand that it’s not a natural body of water,” Casteel told The Huffington Post. “They see a pool and they don’t get it … they can’t just swim to the side and get out. They have to find the exit.” Casteel also works with dogs who may not be used to swimming to get them more comfortable with the water. “I love to see when a dog makes that transition, from ‘What’s going on?’ to, ‘Hey, we’re having fun,’” he said. At his lesson for spcaLA, he also enlisted the help of Ricochet, an acclaimed surfing therapy dog. Ricochet’s calm and confident nature made her the perfect “role model” for dogs who might have felt a bit bewildered by the water at first, Casteel said. Three of the dogs who participated in the spcaLA swim lesson have already been adopted, but three of them — Cloud, Salem and Harrod — are still looking for homes. You can find more information about those dogs and spcaLA here. NOTE: This post was updated to reflect the fact that this particular swimming lesson does not appear in “Finding Fido.”"
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s newest lawyer said Tuesday that his previous lawyer Michael Cohen knows nothing damaging about Trump and therefore is of little value to federal prosecutors investigating him. “He possesses no incriminating information about the president,” Rudy Giuliani told HuffPost, adding that any charges that may be filed against Cohen are unfortunate for him but would not affect Trump. “It’s of no consequence to the president.” Giuliani said he nevertheless feels bad for Cohen and others, such as former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, for the “storm trooper tactics” prosecutors and the FBI have used when carrying out search warrants against them. Cohen is under investigation by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. Manafort is accused of money laundering and making false statements by the office of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence agencies. Giuliani, who was once the U.S. attorney for the same office investigating Cohen and later became New York’s mayor, acknowledged using predawn raids to execute search warrants — such as the one he claimed was used for Manafort — but never against white-collar suspects. “I did that in organized crime cases. I did that in terrorism cases. I did that in murder cases,” Giuliani said. “I didn’t do that with respectable people.” (In a court filing last month, Mueller’s office described the warrant as having authorized a search between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., which it said it complied with.) He scoffed at the notion that the investigation into Manafort was a counterintelligence investigation, not a run-of-the-mill fraud probe. “In your dreams,” he said. Cohen, after inquiring about the topic of questions from HuffPost, did not respond to follow-up queries. He remains at the center of an investigation of how a porn star, Stormy Daniels, received $130,000 to remain quiet about an affair she said she had with Trump a decade ago. The payment came just days before the 2016 presidential election but was never reported as a campaign expense by Cohen or Trump. That payment has spawned a string of contradictory statements from Cohen, Trump and, in the past week, Giuliani. Cohen originally claimed that he paid Daniels using his own money to protect Trump’s reputation. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One last month that he did not know where the money had come from and suggested asking Cohen, whom Trump described as his lawyer. But in a Fox News interview last week, Giuliani revealed that Trump repaid Cohen, arguing that it therefore could not have been a campaign finance violation. Trump followed up with series of tweets, in which he said the money came from a monthly retainer he paid Cohen. Giuliani then told NBC News that Trump may not have known at the time of the payments to Cohen what the money was for, and in a subsequent interview with ABC News, Giuliani said Cohen may have similarly paid off other women too, although Giuliani said he did not have knowledge of that. Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Daniels who is suing Trump to break the 2016 hush agreement, said he finds Giuliani’s comments about Cohen perplexing. “Michael Cohen served as the personal attorney for Donald Trump for upwards of 12 years,” Avenatti said. “The idea that nothing improper that he did in that time period could blow back on Mr. Trump is absurd.” Giuliani said he is pushing to wrap up the Russia probe by figuring out how best to have Trump respond to Mueller’s questions. Giuliani said a May 17 date he mentioned earlier was not a hard deadline for that decision but a goal. “We need some sort of deadline for this. It’s gone on forever,” he said. “It’s hurting the country.” He said the only reason that Mueller was even appointed special counsel was that former FBI Director James Comey “illegally leaked” memos he wrote to a friend, making the whole investigation suspect, in Giuliani’s view. “Memos he writes are FBI property,” he said of Comey. Trump fired Comey a year ago. The White House at first claimed that the reason was his improper conduct during an investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. But Trump soon told NBC News and top Russian diplomats visiting the Oval Office that he fired Comey because of the Russia investigation. Because Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself from that investigation, Comey’s firing led Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to appoint Mueller as a special counsel. Giuliani said Tuesday that Trump was too busy for any extended interviews with Mueller’s investigators, given important negotiations regarding North Korea, Iran and China. “The president is pretty darned tied up right now,” Giuliani said. On a broader level, notwithstanding the recent conflicting statements about Cohen and Daniels, Giuliani said he will have a much better relationship with Trump than his previous lawyers, some of whom were reportedly frustrated by his unwillingness to follow their advice. “They didn’t know him for 30 years like I do. They didn’t help him get elected,” Giuliani said. “I know how to deal with him, and he knows how to deal with me.”   CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that the raid of Manafort’s home took place before dawn. Mueller’s office said in a court filing last month that it complied with a warrant that authorized a search between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m."
ENTERTAINMENT,"“Glee” star Kevin McHale declared that the newly released Ariana Grande song is “gayer” than he is.  The actor, who starred on the musical series as Artie Abrams for six seasons, publicly addressed his sexuality for the first time amid rumors that he’s dating actor Austin McKenzie. ″#NoTearsLeftToCry is gayer than me and I ACCEPT. Ty @ArianaGrande,” he wrote on Twitter Friday in one of several tweets praising the pop star.  #NoTearsLeftToCry is gayer than me and I ACCEPT. Ty @ArianaGrande. He also requested that Grande drop a remix of the song featuring Janet Jackson, which, for the record, we are fully on board with.  McHale has stoked speculation for months with photos of himself and McKenzie on Instagram. Earlier in the week, he seemed to confirm their romance, and shared a photo of himself and McKenzie cuddling together with hashtag #mycoachella in the caption.  A post shared by Kevin McHale (@kevinmchale) on Apr 13, 2018 at 10:09pm PDT The two starred co-starred together in ABC’s eight-part miniseries “When We Rise,” chronicling the gay rights movement over the past 45 years. McHale played AIDS activist Bobbi Campbell."
ENTERTAINMENT,"If you’re using Hulu this May, it will probably be for “The Handmaid’s Tale” and the many new movies the service is adding this month. The second season of “The Handmaid’s Tale” premiered April 25 and will have new episodes on a weekly basis through May. Hulu adds only one other original show this month (“All Night”) so “Handmaid’s” will likely take up your attention. You’ll be able to choose from quite a few movies, though, including “I, Tonya” from last year and popular series like the “Rocky,” “Matrix” and “Nightmare on Elm Street” movies. That said, “I, Tonya” doesn’t join until May 31, so you’ll have to wait a few weeks. Many movies are also leaving Hulu this month, but not too many notable ones. It’s a shame that “Fred: The Movie,” “Fred: Night of the Living Fred” and “Fred 3: Camp Fred” are all disappearing, but you had your chance with those Criterion Collection shoo-ins.    Check out the full list of arrivals and departures below.

ARTS & CULTURE,"In 1986, Adrian Piper began handing out small cards in bars when, after repeated rebuffs, individuals continued to make unwelcome advances. “Dear Friend,” they read. “I am not here to pick anyone up, or to be picked up. I am here alone because I want to be here, ALONE.” Existing as both a work of art and as a practical defense, Piper’s cards foreshadow the types of actions many artists and activists have used since to combat such unwanted attention. While the term street harassment was barely in the general lexicon when Piper created My Calling (Card) #2 (for Bars and Discos), today it is common parlance. With the founding of organizations like Stop Street Harassment and Hollaback! in the past decade and an explosion of media attention around the term in the last year in particular, awareness of the peril of simply walking-while-female is arguably at an all time high. (See: Tatyana Fazlalizadeh’s Stop Telling Women to Smile wheat pastes; Hollaback!’s viral video “10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman”—more on that later; or Jessica Williams’s catcalling segment on the Daily Show.)

ENTERTAINMENT,"“Hi, it’s Helen,” I heard when I picked up the phone Friday afternoon, her pleasant voice a welcome replacement for a publicist’s typical humdrum introduction. I immediately understood this conversation would be between myself and Ms. Helen Hunt, who could navigate my questions herself, thank you very much. For over four decades, Hunt has affected audiences with her warm smile and natural charisma, appearing in everything from the late 1970s sci-fi series “The Bionic Woman” to Louis C.K.’s controversial and critically panned “I Love You, Daddy” last year. She won multiple Emmys for her role as Jamie Buchman in the long-running ’90s TV series “Mad About You” and took home an Oscar for “As Good As It Gets” in ’97. She starred in the films “What Women Want,” “Pay It Forward,” “Cast Away” and “Bobby,” to name just a few, before taking a step off screen to focus on writing and directing. Her two projects, “Then She Found Me” and “Ride,” solidified Hunt as a blossoming filmmaker, giving her the opportunity to direct episodes of television series’ like “Revenge,” “House of Lies,” “Feud,” “This Is Us” and “Splitting Up Together.”  But, at 54, Hunt seems eager to get back on our screens and uncover the kinds of roles she’s long been craving. As an actress who’s witnessed decades of Hollywood ups and downs, she has strong opinions about her industry and the parts she wants to inhabit in it. Currently, she can be seen in “The Miracle Season,” based on the true story of Iowa City’s West High School 2011-12 volleyball team. The squad, after the tragic death of its star player, attempts to conjure up the strength to make it to the state championship alongside tough-love coach Kathy Bresnahan (Hunt). On the phone, sans publicist, we spoke about the movie, the changes she’s experienced in her ever-changing workplace and, of course, those “Mad About You” revival contracts.  You’re a busy woman these days. I suddenly got busy after not being busy! I can’t start this conversation off without mentioning the supposed deals you and Paul Reiser closed for a “Mad About You” reboot. Is it a go?  We closed this thing with Sony, who is our studio, which means that’s great, but there’s nowhere to do it yet. I read somewhere, “They’re being coy.” There’s no being coy, nobody’s bought it yet, you know what I’m saying? I mean, at all. [There’s] nothing I’m even hiding. So our enthusiasm is clear, but we don’t have any home for it yet. And we don’t know if we will or if we’ll have one that everybody likes. Seems like it is marching steadily toward “I hope it happens.” The show is now going to be run by a spectacular writer, Peter Tolan from “Rescue Me” and “Murphy Brown,” with me and Paul by his side. Danny Jacobson (the show’s co-creator) will come back and consult, and that’s great. But we’re really excited that we have Paul and me as the guardians of what it was, and Peter Tolan with new, fresh, smart enthusiasm, who’s going to be doing a lot of the writing. The cocktail of what it was and something brand new is what has made me excited about it. I can’t think of anyone better than Peter Tolan to be that kind of new breath-of-life into it. He’s a big element. His sensibility combined with our comfy-with-each-other thing is exciting to me. To come back with a different spin on it, a different showrunner and possibly a new network must be thrilling. Yes. I honestly can’t high-five yet because no one may want to buy it or, more possibly, how ever those deals get made might not ever get made. But the prospect of doing it went from seeming absurd to seeming really exciting. I’ve always been interested with this show: What is it like to love someone over time? That’s been the thing that hooked me into doing it in the first place. It’s one thing to love somebody after a year and it’s another thing to love somebody after seven years. To check in on what’s the grace and the grit of loving someone after 20 years? That’s a pretty terrific prospect, and with a great new writer and my dear friend who I love acting with. If it happens, I’d be super excited, but I don’t know if it’s going to happen. I really hope it does, especially with the many platforms out there now aside from the networks who could be interested. Right, right. That’s in the hands of who knows what, but I’m open to any place that’s interested in the things we’re interested in. You and Paul were, in a way, trailblazers for successful TV stars ― even earning yourself huge pay raises in the final season of “Mad About You.” (They each got a $750k raise, to $1 million an episode.) Those days are gone [laughs]. But we see these stars now, like Ellen Pompeo, for instance, making a ton of money to remain on hit shows while fighting for what they deserve. Do you see yourself as a pioneer in that world? It would be hard for me to use that word, but I was very aware that I had, thanks to Paul, been invited into an incredibly generous job in every way. Luckily, I knew enough, even in Season 2 and 3, to say to myself once a day, “This isn’t going to last forever, remember that.” Getting to work on 11-page scenes with a scene partner you love working with about something you care about [is amazing]. We didn’t have jerks on the show. There was nobody that made it a drag. It was a particularly lovely group, and Paul and I have remained really great friends, so coming back to all of that would be like, “You’re kidding?” Even though we see a lot of solid roles for women and female-led shows and films, they’re still hard to come by. Are you excited to have the chance to maybe reprise Jamie Buchman and then take on even more roles? Yes. I’m about to go work on something that just so happens would be great. I’m very fired up about my acting at the moment and excited about possibilities that are in front of me and behind me with this movie that’s out, which I’m really proud of. Yes, let’s talk “The Miracle Season.” After taking a few years to focus on directing, what about this character, coach Kathy Bresnahan, resonated with you?   I had worked with the director Sean McNamara before on “Soul Surfer,” so I knew he was a lovely guy and a terrific filmmaker. That’s step one. And I knew that there was a wonderful part in there and I just went ahead and started working on it, and I had the help of the real woman I played. It wasn’t until I was standing on the volleyball court dressed like her, surrounded by these 20-something-year-old women that I thought, “Oh my God. I’m standing exactly where I should be.” In a circle of women, reminding them and myself what their value is. That they can remind themselves of what that value is rather than looking to somebody else, a man in particular, to give it to them. That I could be encouraging and loving with them and still be a fierce leader. It wasn’t until I was playing the part that I realized that. And then, when the movie came out, I went, not only am I standing in a circle of women, which is where I like to be, but I’m standing in a circle of women at a time when that’s, I think, the hope of how to work through this. I have never had an experience of partnering with women around my work or in my friendships when there has been anything other than fierce solidarity. Whatever that myth is about women being competitive with each other, I have never experienced it. We’re now in these Me Too and Time’s Up movements. Do you find that this film fits nicely within this particular moment? I do. I mean, there’s a lot of other stories to tell: There’s anger to write about and healing ― or the impossibility of healing to write about. A lot is going to come out of this forever. I heard [the writer and activist] Alice Walker speak once and she said the most important thing [she’d] done in [her] life was be in a circle with other women and talk. So when I look at the clips from this movie or watch this movie, there they are; standing in a circle, reminding each other and fortifying each other. There’s no movie I’d rather be in today. It’s a true story about this slightly unlikeable, tough coach who happens to be a woman. That’s a role we usually see played by men, so what was the experience portraying Kathy like for you?   I love sports movies. I mean, I wanted to be Kurt Russell in “Miracle” then, so this was my chance. It was a dream come true. I made a sports movie called “Ride” and I did “Soul Surfer,” so this is a genre that I adore and this one had this giant piece of heartbreak and soul in the middle of it. It made it the perfect movie for me. Having a young daughter and being in a movie like “Miracle Season,” are you excited for her to see it. Well, has she seen any of your iconic roles? “Twister,” I hope! She has not seen “Twister.” I suggested it actually and it hasn’t been on the top of her list. She’s not only seen “Miracle Season,” she’s in “Miracle Season.” She has two scenes at the beginning that I had nothing to do with ― she auditioned and she got the part. She’s the younger sister of Erin Moriarty’s love interest. Being on the set surrounded by these wonderful actors-turned-volleyball-players and volleyball-players-turned-actors, they all just treated her like they were her aunties and it was a pretty amazing summer we spent. Could you see her getting into the business? You started young, so… Yeah! It will be utterly and totally up to her.  Over this press cycle, you’ve talked about your fear of “sucking” as an actor. [Laughs] It’s just more a motivator. I didn’t see how healing the movie might be to be in or what it might mean to people at the time it came out, I was just busy doing my work. There’s a famous line from a play where an actress says, “You have no idea what it feels like to be acting when you know it’s bad.” And I quote that to young actors a lot and say, “That’s what makes you do a lot of homework before you start a film.” Do I know who this person is? Do I know what my part in the story is? Am I serving what the writer wrote? Just to avoid feeling like you’re not doing a good job. Looking at past roles that maybe could’ve happened for you, I stumbled across a rumor that you were considered for “Basic Instinct” [before Sharon Stone was cast]. I don’t ever remember being talked about for “Basic Instinct” for one second. Were there any roles you turned down because you felt you couldn’t serve a character or honor the storyteller’s work? There are. I never want to mention parts I’ve turned down. The roles I’ve succeeded in, many of them were turned down by other people, so I don’t want to put my sticky fingers on someone else’s work. But I certainly turned movies down and regretted it; I turned movies down and said, “Thank God! Why did I agonize for three weeks?” You just make the best decisions you can, you know? You went on to win Emmys for “Mad About You” and an Oscar for “As Good As It Gets.” Then you appeared in movies like “What Women Want.” When you look back on that movie, for example, do you still feel like it would have the same success today? I don’t know, they’re remaking it, I think? That’s what I heard. But the movies I look back on that are the most meaningful to me are probably the two that I wrote and directed, just because they came from the very deepest parts of me ― one is called “Then She Found Me” and the other was called “Ride.” And then I was in this movie “The Sessions” a handful of years ago and I feel really proud of that movie. I would like it if younger people saw that movie because in this time of being flooded with sexualized violence and porn, you can’t go anywhere now without seeing it or hearing about it. This was a movie about healthy sex, healthy sexuality and I think it was kind of singular and shocking in a quiet way. I’m very proud to leave that behind ― not that I’m going anywhere soon, but I’m proud that that’s something I was in and helped to make. A beautiful movie which got an enormous response at Sundance in 2012. It did, that was wild. Were you expecting that kind of reception for the movie and your role in it, which earned you an Oscar nomination? No, no, no. I had no idea, but I did sit down and there were, whatever there are, 2,000 people in that auditorium or something, and I had never been to Sundance and right before it started I was like, “I’m about to be vulnerable in every way in front of all of these people.” It was a very quiet screening but there was laughing, which was good, and when it was over, they stood up and they didn’t stop. And I said, “Whoa, this has made some sort of impact on people.” That was really exciting. I can tell when I read something ― especially when I watch something, even one episode of a show I otherwise like ― it will have that sick, frankly, feel to it that deals with sex. So to have a movie that was this intimate, and only feel its honest approach and desire to show what sex can be, I thought was quite remarkable in front of 2,000 people. It was ahead of the curve we’re seeing now with filmmakers taking bigger risks with their female leads. Women not just playing stereotypes. How does it feel now versus a decade or so ago in terms of the treatment of women in Hollywood and the roles you’re being presented with? It’s never been one thing. I can’t say now’s the time when it’s great. Certainly, there’s great parts on television for women for sure, but I don’t know how to say this time is different from before in terms of parts. It’s just all about writers. You just have to nurture and pay [laughs] writers because everybody, men included, are searching for a story and a good writer, and when it comes along, hope they’re smart enough to grab it. Is that why you decided to write, direct and produce your own movies? To make the content you wanted to see? Yeah. Also, writing is step one and discovering the courage to do that was something I wanted to try. When you direct something you wrote, it’s more like getting another chance to rewrite it. You’re rewriting it with the production design, the music and how you’re photographing it. I guess I wanted to experience getting as close to the bone as possible with creating a story. And starring in it. Do you always have yourself in mind for these characters? No, I think it’s, in general, a really bad idea [laughs], in terms of people taking the movie seriously and in terms of enjoying the job of writing and directing it. In these cases [“Then She Found Me,” “Ride”], both practically and creatively, it ended up being the right move. But I don’t recommend it necessarily. I imagine it’s difficult to direct yourself. It is definitely difficult. It’s also terrific, because on a small movie where time is an issue, you have one person who sees the movie the way you do and is willing to work long hours and change in the van and do whatever it takes to get the movie made. It sets a tone for we’re all going to dig in and get this movie made, even with the amount of time and money that we have. But it’s a very different experience; very immersive, to say the least. Women directors, in general, have to push even harder to helm projects and fight for budgets. Are you seeing more female directors get a chance to make movies in the men’s club? It’s all about money. People have to hire women, #JustHire. Hire women, people of color, women of color ― that is how this is changing and it will stop changing if people stop doing that. The pressure that people are feeling to hire not only white men has to remain in order for things to change. You’ve been directing a lot in the television world with “Feud,” “This Is Us” and “Splitting Up Together,” among other shows. Have you seen a shift there in terms of female directors? We’ll see at the end of the year when the directors guild tells us how many [there are]. It was a year or two ago we thought it was getting better and it got like 1 percent worse, so let’s hope. That’s my takeaway too; it seems like there’s more diversity in terms of directors on TV. One thing we all can do ― almost every time I direct I have a mentee with me, a woman, usually. Ryan Murphy really has been doing it for a few years now. He has a mentee program where every time you direct you have a woman or a person of color following you around. He really is in it for the long haul in helping to make sure they’re actually hired to direct. He deserves a ton of credit, I think. He definitely pushed this before anyone else. And the way he’s pushing it is, again, with money. He’s hiring people. At the Oscars this year, Frances McDormand brought up the inclusion rider, which requires a certain level of diversity among a film’s cast and crew. I think it’s fantastic. It comes back to the same thing: hire people.  Are you going to focus on directing as you have been doing or are we going to see you more on screen this year? At the moment I have some acting and some directing on my plate, so I’m really excited about that. And some writing! I’m working hard and enjoying never having to choose between those things. I’ve never been comfortable saying, “I’m more of a comedic actress than a dramatic actress! I prefer this screen over that screen!” I just want to be a part of telling good stories, and today I’m getting to do that. That’s great news. “The Miracle Season” is in theaters now. "
ARTS & CULTURE," Nuclear fallout is, very fortunately, a foreign concept for many of us. The idea of an exclusion zone is just that: an idea -- not something we've ever had to deal with first-hand. Urbex and 500px Prime photographer Iain Bolton, however, has seen it first hand. In photos uploaded just a couple of months ago, he offers us a haunting glimpse into the town of Pripyat, the nuclear city established in February of 1970 to support a nearby power plant you might have heard of... It was called Chernobyl.  Pripyat is, to put it lightly, a wasteland. Once a town of nearly 50,000 residents with schools, hospitals, pools, and performance halls, it was transformed into its current state almost overnight after the Chernobyl disaster on April 26, 1986. Now, the only people who wander the city's once-bustling grounds are those who, like Iain, are brave enough to walk inside the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Fortunately for those of us who would prefer to stay far away, Urbex photographers like Iain go there for us, returning with photos that are equal parts haunting and haunted. Scroll down to see them all for yourself.              All of the photos above are available to license through the 500px Prime marketplace -- in fact, several are exclusive to 500px -- along with many of Iain's other gritty urban exploration photographs.

ENTERTAINMENT,"Jack Osbourne’s wife has filed for divorce just months after giving birth to the couple’s third child. On Friday, Lisa Stelly Osbourne filed the documents in court, according to The Blast. The two tied the knot in 2012 in Hawaii and have three girls together. The youngest, Minnie Theodora, was born in February, according to Page Six. The others are Pearl Clementine, 5, and Andy Rose, 2. The breakup comes just days after Jack Osbourne posted a Mother’s Day tribute to his wife on Instagram, which can be seen below. Still, it may have been inevitable, according to Entertainment Tonight, which quotes a source who said the couple has had problems since the beginning. “We all kind of thought it would go this way,” the source said, according to ET, though things seemed to get better after they had the children. “They seemed so happy.”  Sources told Page Six that the couple has been fighting badly for about nine months and that Jack Osbourne has been staying with other family members. A representative for Jack Osbourne did not immediately respond to a request for comment. This is a developing story. A post shared by Jack Osbourne (@jackosbourne) on May 13, 2018 at 10:07am PDT"
ARTS & CULTURE," For centuries, the mountain has been an important symbol to the spirituality of mankind. Often referred to as the Holy or Sacred Mountain, in many cultures its peaks were worshiped as Earth's closest steeple to heaven and other celestial dimensions. In Greece, the mighty Mount Olympus was central to Greek mythology being home to the Gods and Goddesses and where Zeus defeated the Titans. According to the Torah and the Old Testament in the Bible, Mount Sinai in Egypt was where Moses received the Ten Commandments and Tibet's Mount Kailash is believed by Buddhists to possess a mystical power that can absolve a lifetime of sins for any human.
Photo by James Good A portal into a sacred world, high above the miasma of city life, stands the tetrahedral Mount Baldy. With an elevation of 10,064 feet, it is the summit of the San Gabriel Mountains and the highest point in Los Angeles County. Sitting atop this majestic mountain is 5 Points Gathering, an intimate 3-stage transformational music festival that is family friendly and boasts yoga, healthy living, bass music, vendors, installations and live art.  Taking place on the weekend of July 3rd-5th, 2015, amenities and attractions include tent bungalow camping upgrades, showers, Around the Tree live art installation, Yucca Roots Village, and Circuit Trees by Erica Halpern. One of the most unique aspects of this event is the Sugar Pine Chairlift which is the only way to access the gathering areas, assuring that attendees are truly peaking by being taken to the highest point of the mountain. Riding the chairlift up through the verdant forest to arrive at 5 Points Gathering is a sacred experience, like climbing a mountain to arrive at a holy temple of enlightenment. Though one of the smaller, more intimate festivals, 5 Points still offers a lineup of stellar performers. The Friday house and bass lineup includes Christian Martin, Ruff Hauser, Cameron St. Denis, Worthy, Oscure, and many more. The Saturday future bass lineup includes Sugarpill, Goldrush, Jobot, Henry Pope, Kompozart, AfroQBen, Orphic, Lou E. Bagels, J-Mart, and Bass Tribe of San Diego, just to name a few. In addition to the announced lineup, rumors of surprise guests are yet to be announced.  The 360-degree view of the breathtaking San Gabriel Mountains is a reminder that this is, as are all transformational music festivals, a leave-no-trace event. We are blessed with the gift of celebrating on this sacred landscape so it is our mission to bless the land back with our love, gratitude and respect. In addition to offering the land our blessings, we must also offer each other these blessings as it is the kinship between people that makes this event special. Being so small, 5 Points Gathering is about creating a community where we are all connected and respected. So let us gather upon the sacred Mount Baldy where we will touch the cosmos and let the supernatural powers of music, art and human beings move and shake us.  Website: http://5pointsgathering.com/

ARTS & CULTURE,"Does President Donald Trump read books? He says yes, he “like[s] reading books.” Other evidence suggests no. During interviews on the campaign trail and post-election, he’s never been able to name a book other than the Bible, his own works, and All Quiet on the Western Front unless said other book is directly in front of him.  Still, let us posit that President Trump will read entire books during his term in office. In that case, there’s good news: He need not rely on his own ghostwriters’ output, nor commemorative books sent to him by CNN, for material. The experts are stepping in. The executive director of the National Book Foundation, Lisa Lucas, offered Time’s Sarah Begley a few reading recommendations for the new POTUS. Appropriately, she suggested books that have recently been honored by her organization, which administers the prestigious National Book Awards: Claudia Rankine’s Citizen; John Lewis, Andrew Aydin and Nate Powell’s March; Arlie Russell Hochschild’s Strangers in Their Own Land; and Ibram X. Kendi’s Stamped From the Beginning. All of the books she recommended, whether in poetry (Citizen), graphic memoir for young readers (March), or nonfiction, explore marginalized American peoples. Strangers in Their Own Land is a sociological examination of the white working poor in Louisiana, which seeks to understand why people who need government assistance turn to Tea Party ideologies that reject big government. The others focus on the struggles of black Americans and the long history of American racism. Though Lucas may be one of the most qualified citizens to suggests useful reads to President Trump, she’s not alone. In December, Elle’s Sarah M. Broom listed a handful of titles he would benefit from reading, a syllabus which also focused on racial education told through an assortment of fiction and nonfiction. She suggests Impounded: Dorothea Lange and the Censored Images of Japanese American Internment, noting the parallels to Trump’s controversially proposed Muslim registry. Other recs: W.G. Sebald’s The Emigrants and the first issue of the Marvel series “Black Panther” by Ta-Nehisi Coates, Brian Stelfreeze and Laura Martin. An NPR piece by Annie Tomlinson and Vincent Ialenti took a more nuclear approach, compiling scientific reads that would help our new president navigate the current military industrial complex he now oversees. (Their recommendations have comforting titles such as Whole World on Fire by Lynn Eden and Wizards of Armageddon by Fred Kaplan.) All available evidence suggests that Trump will not go out of his way to read any of these books, and that even if a book is given to him, he will read “passages, I read areas, chapters, I don’t have the time,” as he told Megyn Kelly in an interview last year, when pressed on the last full book he read. He is, of course, busy with other activities. As Politico reported on Sunday, a source close to the president revealed that “He gets bored and likes to watch TV.” That can only mean one thing. Cable pundits, it’s time to drop everything and start marathon read-alouds from Edward E. Baptist’s The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism. Do it for America."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Steven Spielberg is directing his attention toward the DC Universe. The “Ready Player One” director has agreed to produce and possibly direct a movie based on the World War II-era character “Blackhawk” for Warner Brothers. The series debuted in 1941, according to The Hollywood Reporter, but isn’t well known to today’s audiences. Still, it fits in Spielberg’s World War II wheelhouse, since it’s about an international squadron of Nazi-fighting pilots led by a man named Blackhawk. There is no release date for “Blackhawk” but “Jurassic Park” screenwriter David Koepp will write the script, according to Polygon.com. Warner Brothers has not made it clear whether “Blackhawk” will interact with Superman or Wonder Woman in the DC Universe. In the meantime, Spielberg has other projects in the pipeline, including “Indiana Jones 5” and “West Side Story,” according to Variety. "
BUSINESS,"The video couldn’t have been released at a worse time. About a year ago, Travis Kalanick, then CEO of Uber, was defending himself in a meeting with company executives, insisting that the ride-hailing startup’s wounds were primarily a public relations problem and certainly not his fault. Then, as Bloomberg tells it, one of the execs beckoned Kalanick out into the hall. Joined by a third employee, they watched a newly published video, captured by a dashcam, of the CEO cursing out an Uber driver who’d had the audacity to tell him the company’s fare structure was bankrupting drivers. The video ends as Kalanick exits the car with a curse and a slammed door. Back in the hallway, here’s what happened next, per Bloomberg:  As the clip ended, the three stood in stunned silence. Kalanick seemed to understand that his behavior required some form of contrition. According to a person who was there, he literally got down on his hands and knees and began squirming on the floor. “This is bad,” he muttered. “I’m terrible.” The anecdote is one part of a longer Bloomberg story about the end of Kalanick’s tenure at Uber, with a particular focus on the decisions that led to his forced resignation last June. Among those poor choices was Kalanick’s followup with the driver in the video, Fawzi Kamel. He met with Kamel for an apology just days after the video’s release, but what was supposed to be a brief five-minute meeting turned into an hour-long affair as Kalanick rehashed many of the issues that had triggered his first intemperate response. Then, to the concern of other Uber executives, he tried to make it up to Kamel by offering him stock in the company. Wayne Ting, Uber’s San Francisco manager at the time, told Bloomberg that Kalanick’s behavior stemmed from a lack of self-control. On counsel from Uber’s lawyers, Kalanick decided instead to pay Kamel $200,000 from his own personal account. Things aren’t all bad for the former CEO, however. With the official close of Uber’s massive investment deal with SoftBank on Thursday, the 41-year-old is now officially a billionaire. Read Bloomberg’s full feature on Kalanick here."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Whether or not you consider yourself an avid reader, there is something undeniably magical about entering a library. Perhaps it’s the cloak of silence blanketing the space, which amplifies the sound of every flipping page and muffled whisper. Maybe it’s the majestic architecture that transforms the public spaces into literary temples, or the subconscious feeling that an infinite wealth of knowledge is at your fingertips.  If perchance you are not in the immediate vicinity of a hall of books, worry not; Thomas R. Schiff will bring the library to you. The photographer’s series “The Library Exhibition” features a selection of 360-degree, panoramic photographs that mimic the feeling of entering an expansive library space. And the best part is, there’s no library card necessary.  Schiff, who has previously photographed modernist homes and cathedral ceilings with the same panoramic style, captured the image of 38 libraries around the country, from Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello library to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale. Because Schiff captures the spaces before the libraries open to the public, few people are seen roaming the book-laden halls, allowing the eye to focus on the myriad architectural details and structural differences.  The photographs come together to show the history of the library in America, a space traditionally designated for community and learning. There have been, however, significant changes to the library model over time. For example, prior to the late 18th century, libraries were spaces reserved for the elites; not until Benjamin Franklin opened the first American lending library in 1790 were the spaces open to the public.  Are such ideological shifts evident in the buildings’ stained-glass windows, winding staircases, and looming chandeliers? Take a brief tour through Schiff’s favorite libraries and come to your own conclusion.  Thomas R. Schiff’s “The Library Exhibition” is on view from March 15 until April 20 at Aperture Gallery, New York."

POLITICS,"Stormy Daniels’ attorney Michael Avenatti posted photos Sunday on Twitter showing Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen getting into an elevator at Trump Tower with a man appearing to be a Qatari banker accused in a lawsuit affidavit of boasting that he bribed Washington politicians. Avenatti said Cohen was in the building shortly after the presidential election meeting with a group of Qataris, including Ahmed al-Rumaihi, an official of  Qatar’s national wealth fund. The photos of Cohen appear to be screengrabs of a video posted on C-Span from the “Trump Tower Cam” dated December 12, 2016. A group of men — including the man who appears to be al-Rumaihi — can be seen getting into an elevator with Cohen. Cohen pats one of the men on the back as the group enters the elevator. In a tweet, Avenatti linked to the video (up top) showing the men entering the elevator (just after 7:42:30) and most of them leaving (shortly after 9:08:15). This is a clip of the video showing the group of men with Cohen: Why did the men meet, Avenatti asked in his tweet, adding: “and why did Mr. Al-Rumaihi later brag about bribing administration officials according to a sworn declaration filed in court?” Why was Ahmed Al-Rumaihi meeting with Michael Cohen and Michael Flynn in December 2016 and why did Mr. Al-Rumaihi later brag about bribing administration officials according to a sworn declaration filed in court? Al-Rumaihi was accused last month of trade libel and contractual interference in a $1.2 billion lawsuit filed by rapper Ice Cube and business partner Jeff Kwatinetz. The suit accuses Al-Rumaihi and other investors of failing to pay funds promised to the partners’ BIG3 basketball league. An affidavit filed last week in California Superior Court in Los Angeles accused Al-Rumaihi of plotting to use the promised investment to influence former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. “After making partial payment to the BIG3, there were numerous occasions during the 2017 season where Mr. Al-Ruhmaihi would bring up Mr. Bannon’s name to me and comment about Mr. Bannon’s political positions, his views on the blockade, the Trump administration’s position toward Qatar, and he persistently inquired about wanting to meet with Mr. Bannon,” Kwatinetz stated in the affidavit. “Mr. Al-Rumaihi requested I set up a meeting between him, the Qatari government, and Steven Bannon, and to tell Steve Bannon that Qatar would underwrite all of his political efforts in return for his support.” Kwatinetz, who is a friend of Bannon’s, said that he rejected the offer because he considered it a bribe. He stated that he did not tell Bannon of the conversation. Kwatinetz said in the affidavit that “Al-Rumaihi laughed and [said] that I shouldn’t be naive, that so many Washington politicians take our money.”  Avenatti also tweeted a photo in the lobby of Trump Tower the same day of the apparent meeting of Cohen talking with Michael Flynn. But that photo appeared to be a screen grab from a different YouTube video of the lobby. Flynn is not seen with the man who appears to be al-Rumaihi or the group he is with. Trump fired Flynn as his national security adviser after Flynn lied about his contacts with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Avenatti’s tweets. Avenatti indicated that the photos and information he posted Sunday were payback for the “refusal of various” unspecified “parties to come clean” and to “stop with the personal attacks.” Although he didn’t specify who he was talking about, the attorney taunted: “Keep pushing us.” Warning ignored. So here it goes.December 12, 2016 - Trump Tower. Details to follow... pic.twitter.com/aEuuhRHB4a And to be clear - by “warning ignored” I am referring to the refusal of various parties to come clean and the failure of various parties and news outlets to stop with the personal attacks on our side.

POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― Civil rights groups contend a new Senate bill that is supposed to crack down on sexual harassers in Congress is full of problems and lets lawmakers off the hook too easily. The bill, which quietly sailed through the Senate on Thursday, makes some needed updates to the Congressional Accountability Act, a decades-old law that set up the process for handling workplace complaints about harassment and discrimination on Capitol Hill. It eliminates rules forcing people claiming sexual harassment to undergo counseling, mandatory arbitration and an absurd 30-day “cooling off” period before taking a complaint to court. But the American Civil Liberties Union has “grave concerns” that the bill is still too weak to be effective. It narrowly defines sexual harassment as actions that are “severe or pervasive” and requires that such harassment be “unwanted” (suggesting an alleged harasser could defend himself by claiming “she wanted it”). It lets lawmakers hide past discrimination settlements they’ve paid for with taxpayer money. It does not provide legal representation to accusers, a measure that was included in a similar House-passed bill. “Members of Congress should be held accountable for their discriminatory conduct, but instead this bill appears to provide numerous opportunities to evade responsibility, while also failing to offer Senate professional staff the same kind of legal counsel and support that members of Congress receive,” said Vania Leveille, the ACLU’s senior legislative counsel. The ACLU, the National Women’s Law Center and other groups outlined their concerns in a Wednesday letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). Read the letter here:  Letter from civil rights groups on Senate sexual harassment bill on Scribd The Senate has had a much harder time overhauling sexual harassment policy than the House, which unanimously passed its bill in early February. Why? Some anonymous male GOP senators did not like a provision in the House bill requiring lawmakers to pay out-of-pocket when they settle a lawsuit accusing them of sexual harassment or discrimination. After three months of inaction, Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) finally hashed out the current Senate bill this week. It passed Thursday on a voice vote. Lead negotiators of the House bill also said the Senate plan does little to hold harassers accountable. “Democrats and Republicans on the House side are disappointed,” Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) said Thursday on CNN.  “The House passed a very strong bill that protects the victim,” she said. “Hopefully we can iron out some of those differences, because in the end, the balance of power has always been with the harasser and the institution. We want to equalize that so that the victim has protections as well.” Aides to Blunt and Klobuchar did respond to a request for comment. The next step is likely a conference committee, which involves select lawmakers from the House and Senate going into a room and trying to agree on a final bill. House and Senate leaders will have to name those negotiators."
BUSINESS,"By Ankur Banerjee (Reuters) - U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp <CI.N> said on Thursday it would buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co <ESRX.O> for about $54 billion, the latest deal in the sector aimed at tackling soaring healthcare costs. The move follows the $69 billion merger of insurer Aetna Inc <AET.N> and drugstore chain CVS Health Corp <CVS.N> announced last December, and highlights a sector-wide trend toward deals between companies that do not have directly overlapping operations. The deals seek to lower healthcare costs by bringing under one roof pharmacy and medical claims, and give the combined entities greater leverage in price negotiations with drugmakers. Cigna’s offer consists of $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of stock of the combined company for each Express Scripts share, amounting to $96.03 per share. That represents a premium of nearly 31 percent to Express Scripts’ Wednesday closing price. Express Scripts shares were up 18.6 percent at $87.10, while Cigna shares were down 4.25 percent at $186. The transaction is valued at $67 billion, including about $15 billion in Express Scripts’ debt, the company said. Pharmacy benefit managers administer prescription drug programs for health insurers, self-insured companies and government agencies, negotiating deals with drug manufacturers, working with pharmacies and processing claims. The CVS-Aetna deal was seen pressuring rival insurers, drugmakers, PBMs and retail pharmacies to consider mergers or switching partners to try to keep up with the potential healthcare cost savings or increase in profit margins. The wave of consolidation in the sector also comes in the backdrop of a shifting landscape, including changes in the U.S. Affordable Care Act, rising drug prices and the threat of competition from Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O>. Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said the deal may surprise investors given Cigna has said that they are satisfied with their PBM arrangement with UnitedHealth’s <UNH.N> Optum unit. “It is possible that the threat of an Amazon entry into the healthcare and possibly the drug supply chain landscape, with the latest news of the Amazon/Berkshire Hathaway/JPMorgan employer coalition has spurred Cigna and Express Scripts to tie the knot.” Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway Inc <BRKa.N> and JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> said in January they would form a company to cut health costs for hundreds of thousands of their employees.   After the deal closes, Cigna shareholders will own about 64 percent of the combined company and Express Scripts shareholders the rest. Cigna intends to fund the cash portion of the deal through a combination of cash on hand, Express Scripts debt and new debt issuance. The company is expected to have debt of about $41.1 billion after the deal closes. The insurer said it obtained fully committed debt financing from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd for the deal. The combined company will be led by current Cigna Chief Executive Officer David Cordani. The deal comes a year after Cigna’s deal to buy Anthem Inc <ANTM.N> was blocked by antitrust regulators. Morgan Stanley was the financial adviser to Cigna and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz was the legal adviser. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is providing regulatory counsel. Centerview Partners and Lazard Frères were financial advisers to Express Scripts, with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP serving as legal counsel and Holland & Knight LLP as regulatory counsel.

ARTS & CULTURE,"”I thought we were headed on a different trajectory,” New York-based artist Roxanne Jackson sighed in an interview with The Huffington Post. “I just really didn’t anticipate ... this.” Jackson was referring to the events of Nov. 9, 2016, when Donald Trump was elected president of the United States.  In the days that followed, Jackson’s emotional state shifted from utter shock to a foggy depression as she struggled to come to terms with the fact that our nation’s foremost leader will soon be a man who has publicly objectified, demeaned, humiliated, threatened and bragged about assaulting women without recourse. A man with plans to defund Planned Parenthood, to “punish” women for having abortions and to rescind decades of progress toward gender equality.  Jackson was hardly alone in her feelings of disbelief, anger and fear. But she didn’t realize the extent of her support system until Nov. 14, 2016, when Jackson spontaneously posted a callout on Facebook. “Hello female artists/curators! Let’s organize a NASTY WOMEN group show!!! Who’s interested???” she wrote, tagging women artists, curators, and writers in her circle. Shortly after posting, Jackson went offline to spend a day at work teaching ceramics. Unknown to her at the time, the message went viral as nasty artist after nasty artist recruited other like-minded ladies for the cause. “I had no idea how much this would escalate and evolve,” Jackson said. Within the first hour of posting, she had 300 responses.  The reaction to Jackson’s idea was so enthusiastic and impassioned that the prospect of curating a neat and tidy exhibition, capped at a certain number of participants, no longer felt quite right. After discussing the burgeoning project with her co-organizer, curator Jessamyn Fiore, Jackson decided no nasty woman would be turned away or left behind. And thus, “The Nasty Women Art Exhibition,” a sprawling buffet of proudly rude, women-identifying artists, was born.  In part, Jackson’s idea was inspired by her experience protesting outside of Trump Tower after election weekend and the overwhelming catharsis of being enveloped in a throng of united people. Through her art show, more of a visual protest than a traditional exhibition, she hoped to further communicate to nasty women everywhere that they are not alone.  To do so, Jackson and her team, comprised of Jessamyn Fiore, Angel Bellaran, Barbara Smith, Haley Shaw, Young Sun Han, Clive Murphy, Carolina Wheat, Liz Nielsen, Stephanie Stockbridge, and Aimee Odum, invited women artists from all over the world to submit their work. The only requirement was that their piece measures under 12 inches in every direction (a simple limitation meant to help manage the large quantity of artworks coming in). No artist who offered work was denied inclusion, and as a result, the crew acquired approximately 1,000 pieces by the time submissions closed.  “The Nasty Women Art Show” will be on view at Queens’ Knockdown Center starting Jan. 12 ― just one week before inauguration day. The multidisciplinary pieces, sent in by a whopping 694 artists, will be suspended from 12-foot tall sculptures that will read “Nasty Women” in hot pink letters. Some artists in the show, Jackson explained, are well-established in the New York art scene, but most aren’t names you’d find on the usual gallery roster. Some hail from small towns in red states, others from outside the U.S. completely, and many have never exhibited work before.  The true force of the show, more than any singular name or piece, is the sheer amount of images on view and the solidarity that number represents. “This show isn’t necessarily about highlighting individual artists,” Jackson explained. “It’s about female-identifying artists coming together against the Trump regime.”  Another wonderfully anti-establishment element of the exhibition is that the works on view are priced at $100 or less, with all proceeds benefitting Planned Parenthood. Viewers, then, can come home with a $10 artwork or a $100 piece by an artist whose works usually bring in far more zeroes. Jackson described the show as “cash and carry,” meaning you won’t have to wait until the end of the exhibition to take your new, feminist masterpiece ― just make sure to bring some dollar bills. “Hopefully the show will just look like very naked letters at the end,” Jackson mused. It’s a strange time to be an artist in America. On the one hand, the urge to resist and express through creative means is stronger and more necessary than ever. And yet it’s easy for art to feel futile, insular and trivial amid dire political times. Jackson, whose ceramic sculptures often operate on the fringes of the feminine grotesque, found that, post-election, her glam-horror aesthetic was no longer so horrific. “I’ve been making these monsters, but they’re not dark enough, they’re not intense enough,” she said. “However scary a sculpture could look, it’s nothing compared to Trump in the White House. The reality is horrifying.” Yet rather than giving up on her craft, Jackson became more determined than ever to channel her skills into active resistance. For this reason, it was crucial to Jackson that the “Nasty Women” exhibition not just be “a group show of Bushwick artists,” as she put it, but an accessible visual protest that could reach beyond the borders usually ascribed to art happenings.  Along with the New York-based show, there are currently 23 other “Nasty Happenings” scheduled for the coming two months, taking place everywhere from Lubbock, Texas, to Brussels, Belgium. Jackson invites any and all other nasty women interested in getting involved to organize their own “Nasty Women” show, with instructions available on the show’s website. Her only request is that all shows adopting the “Nasty” name donate their proceeds to an organization benefiting women’s rights.   “I want this visual art protest to count,” Jackson said. “I want to inspire others, to continue to make art, to continue to march in protest, to resist as much as possible. This election has been a wake-up call. Our challenge is to not forget. We can’t just be defeated; we can’t just turn apathetic. We have to be active.”  “The Nasty Women Art Exhibition” will run from Jan. 12 through Jan. 15 at The Knockdown Center, Maspeth, Queens, NYC.

Electronic Superhighway 2016-1966: Digital Art in Historic Context In the September 2012 issue of Artforum, art critic Claire Bishop caused a stir in a piece called the ""Digital Divide."" In this article, which begins with the provocative statement, ""Whatever happened to digital art?"" Bishop claimed that ""the appearance and content of contemporary art have been curiously unresponsive to the total upheaval in our labor and leisure inaugurated by the digital revolution."" Whilst dismissing new media art as a specialized corner of the art world, altogether too ""niche"" to consider with regards to her argument, she lamented that the ""mainstream art world"" on the whole has seemed to willfully ignore the effects of the digital age.

In the wake of exhibitions like the 2015 New Museum Triennial and the rise of the art world's Instagram obsession, it seems that the digital revolution and the drastic changes it has wrought in every aspect of how we live, work, and play have become more central to the art conversation now. Many of the new media artists that Bishop passed over in 2012 as belonging to an obscure niche could be considered mainstream in 2016. Art museums now sponsor festivals of Internet Cat Videos. Yet we are still clearly in the throes of grappling with the question of ""what it means to think, see, and filter affect through the digital,"" while the digital landscape continues to shift and change quickly and often imperceptibly under our feet. We are caught in swell, with the horizon line lost in the distance. A period in time when it suddenly becomes nearly impossible to imagine what life was like before the internet. (What on earth did we do all day?)  Katja Novitskova, Innate Disposition 2, 2012, digital print on aluminum, cutout display. Courtesy of the Artist and Kraupa-Tuskany Zeidler, Berlin. A new exhibition at Whitechapel Gallery in London, opening January 29, 2016, attempts to give some historical perspective to how computer and internet technologies have left their imprint on art making in the last 50 years. ""Electronic Superhighway (2016-1966),"" curated by Omar Kholeif with Séamus McCormack, is a major exhibition comprising over 100 artworks from artists like Hito Steyerl, Amalia Ulman, Cory Arcangel, Ryan Trecartin, Nam June Paik, and Stan VanDerBeek--a timely and welcome retrospective of art practices from post-internet to proto-internet.  Eduardo Kac, Tesão (Horny), 1985, Minitel Artwork. Courtesy the artist and England & Co. Gallery, London. © Eduardo Kac. Significantly, the exhibition moves backwards in time, from 2016 to 1966. This orientation of the chronology is instructive in a number of ways. Firstly, because internet technologies are so pervasive in our daily lives, it can be difficult to distance one's perspective from them. By moving back in time, the exhibition eases us into the past, rather than launching us abruptly back into 1966 when computers took up whole rooms and were operated by punch cards and dials. Secondly, by experiencing the newer works first, their impressions are overlaid onto the earlier works, whose foundational qualities become more apparent, from early net art, to computer generated drawings, to performances synchronized to occur at a global scale.

The exhibition begins with works of art made in the last decade or so (from 2000-2016), works that engage with the contemporary conditions enabled and engendered by the pervasive influence of the internet into our daily lives. Works like Oliver Laric's painting series Versions (Missile Variations) (2010) address the new ecology of images we inhabit, while Amalia Ulman's Instagram project Excellences & Perfections (2014-2015) examines how we construct our lives and relate to each other through social media. More sinister issues of the global network, from surveillance to commercialization, are explored through works from artists like Trevor Paglen to activist collectives like The Yes Men.

Stepping back to the age before the advent of the high resolution digital image, before the widespread adoption of social media, before Web 2.0 and the dot-com boom, the early days of the world wide web, in the 1990's, gave rise to early user-based net art, such as Olia Lialina's 1996 project My Boyfriend Came Back from the War. The new media art of this period centered on the development of individual web pages, many of which are now archived by the digital arts organization Rhizome. Net art, while graphically primitive, emphasized the built-in characteristics of the web browser and other developments in digital network technologies that were new at the time: hyperlinks and interactive features allowed narratives to unfold at the click of the mouse.

Prior to 1989, in the pre-internet days, artists were involved in myriad experiments in other emergent electronic technologies that anticipated the networked and globally connected world. As a good example, in Good Morning, Mr. Orwell (1984), artist Nam June Paik organized an ambitious live television program of performances by artists and pop musicians, from Laurie Anderson to the Thompson Twins, transmitted internationally via satellite and broadcast in the U.S., Germany, and South Korea. It was Paik, in fact, who coined the phrase ""electronic superhighway,"" back in 1974, predicting the rise of global communications networks and the inter-connected world.

""Electronic Superhighway"" concludes in 1966 with Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), an organization that paired artists with engineers. E.A.T. debuted in 1966 with a series of performance art presentations involving new technologies such as closed-circuit television, fiber optics, and wireless transmitters. These performances took place over nine evenings at the 69th Regiment Armory in New York, with artists such as Öyvind Fahlström, John Cage, and Robert Rauschenberg. As an organization, E.A.T., presided over by engineer Billy Klüver, facilitated the innovations of many artists in collaboration with scientists and engineers, forming networks of professionals and bridging the gap between new technologies and new media.

Victoria and Albert Museum, London. © Frieder Nake/ Victoria and Albert Museum, London. It is particularly fitting that the exhibition's closing note strikes a chord on the notion of collaboration and networks. So much of the art that has been produced under the influence of the internet is collaborative--involving the interaction of its digital audiences, for instance, or produced in collaboration with the technology, interface, or platform it is based on. Our networked world is primarily a collaborative one--we are working together, all the time, to create and recreate it.  Lynn Hershman Leeson, Seduction of a Cyborg, 1994, DVD with sound, still image. ZKM Collection. © (2015) ZKM Center for Art and Media, Karlsruhe, © Lynn Hershman Leeson. Perhaps the fact that so much of our lives take place within this networked, technologically based world makes us somewhat blind to its effects. But that's where the artists come in, to help us recognize that--even if we don't see the importance of their efforts right away. Writing about the first performances of E.A.T. in 1966, artist Robert Smithson pessimistically deemed it ""The Funeral of Technology."" Sometimes the critics miss the point, in the moment. Of course, art's true impact is always clearer in retrospect. --Natalie Hegert

ARTS & CULTURE,"In Hallencourt, where writer Édouard Louis grew up, the word “violence” is seldom used. Which isn’t to say it’s a peaceful, idyllic place. There may be the ostensible benefits of the countryside; the surrounding area may be lively and green. But the town ― which, in France’s recent presidential race, favored the Trump-esque Marine Le Pen ― is marked by its gendered social values. Louis ― born Eddy Bellegueule ― writes in his novel The End of Eddy that he was chastised and bullied for his “affected” voice from a young age. His father and eldest brother were both drinkers and fighters. Like most men in Hallencourt, his father dropped out of high school to work at a factory, but was unable to continue his work due to an injured back. The author flatly recounts memories of his father, who would murder litters of kittens and brawl for sport. Louis, meanwhile, took pleasure in trying on women’s clothes, and devised excuses for skipping out on soccer practice. Louis’s parents, and others in town, eventually came to accept his queerness just as they conceded the personhood of the only black person they knew in town. But acceptance came with a stipulation, a rationalization: we like you because you’re not like the others. Being not like the others meant being tough. In Hallencourt, toughness was the highest virtue. It meant doing backbreaking work. It meant, in Louis’ case, not flinching when a classmate hocked a phlegmy wad of spit onto his face. Louis is gifted at limning visceral descriptions of squalor. His want to not allow doctors to cede control of his body, and his resulting choice to spray a tetanus-blackened foot with perfume; his dust-covered and smoke-filled home, made worse by having asthma; his dad’s proclivity for fixing up old TV’s, and demanding that the family watch together in silence over dinner. The psychological insights he culls from these experiences are poignant. His mother’s tendency to declare that she’s “not a lady,” the habit both kids and adults in town had of laughing at the pain of others, as though laughter conveyed strength of character. Of being bullied at school, Louis writes, “They laughed when my face began to turn purple from lack of oxygen (a natural response from working-class people, the simplicity of those who possess little and enjoy laughing, who know how to have a good time).” On the town’s rampant racism, Louis’ takeaways run the risk of being facile. “There is a will that exists, a desperate, constantly renewed effort to place some people on a level below you,” he explains plainly. Still, the writer’s emotional tenor and clear-sightedness make this a must-read for anyone looking to learn more about class in the West, and how it weighs on the state of politics. The bottom line A touching story that’s artfully told, The End of Eddy will both make you want to turn away ― the descriptions of violence are that rich, and sensate ― and continue on with its frank and generous author. Who wrote it Édouard Louis, aka Eddy Bellegueule, is the author of two novels. Michael Lucey, the book’s translator, is a professor of French literature at the University of California, Berkeley. Who will read it Anyone interested in the burgeoning subgenre of autofiction, or in stories about class, masculinity, and growing up queer. What other reviewers think Slate: “Coming to terms with his childhood has resulted in this stark and honest image of French working class society, rendered in an authentic voice.” Washington Post: “What is most impressive about The End of Eddy is that its author turned himself into a man capable of creating such a vivid and honest self-portrait.” Opening lines “From my childhood I have no happy memories. I don’t mean to say that I never, in all those years, felt any happiness or joy. But suffering is all-consuming: it somehow gets rid of anything that doesn’t fit into its system.” Notable passage “The truth was that the display of all these bits of flesh was driving me crazy. I was using words like fags, fairies, queers to keep my distance from them. I used these words against the others in the hope that they would stop invading every inch of my body.” The End of EddyÉdouard LouisFarrar, Straus and Giroux, $23.00May 2 The Bottom Line is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Fantasy and sci-fi stories take place in faraway lands or alternate universes, but they still suffer from the same failures of representation as many 21st-century Hollywood films. Whether the setting is Middle Earth or Winterfell, almost everyone is white. An upcoming trilogy by author Marlon James will bring some much-needed diversity to the fantasy genre.  The Dark Star Trilogy by James, winner of the 2015 Man Booker Prize for his novel A Brief History of Seven Killings, is billed as the “African ‘Game of Thrones.’” The books will follow three characters ― the Tracker, the Moon Witch and the Boy ― as they decipher what went wrong in a search for a missing child. The main characters are three of eight mercenaries who were hired by a slave trader to track down a kidnapped kid. The book takes place nine years after that fact, when five of the mercenaries as well as the missing child are dead ― and seeks to put together the missing pieces using not-quite-reliable witness testimony. Expect mer-creatures, underworld darkness, magical techniques, a mysterious dwarf race and far more unadulterated geekery. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, James explained how his frustration with the lack of characters of color in existing fantasy books led him to create his own. “Originally it came from a fight that I had with somebody. I think it was when they announced the casting for ‘The Hobbit,’” James recalled. “I remember saying, ‘You know, if an Asian or a black hobbit came out of the Shire, nobody would have cared. We would have just moved on.’ And my friend said, ‘Well, Lord of the Rings is all this British and Celtic mythology.’ And I said, ‘Well, you know ... Lord of the Rings isn’t real.’ It just turned into one of these arguments we have about diversity and inclusion.” The writer summed up his stance in Man of the World magazine: “I realized how sick and tired I was of arguing about whether there should be a black hobbit in Lord of the Rings.” The works that helped shaped James’ trilogy are a multifarious spread, ranging from Angela Carter’s The Bloody Chamber to Marvel’s “Luke Cage,” Ursula K. Le Guin’s Earthsea to the paintings of Salvador Dalí. Yet James was particularly influenced by African epics like The Epic of Son-Jara and The Epic of Askia Mohammed, created around the same time as Beowulf. “It made me start to think about the fantastic African epic traditions — some of the stories I grew up with, like ‘Anansi the Spider,’” James told EW. “I just realized that there’s this huge pool of fantastic stories to draw from. It’s sort of like my being a scholar of African history and mythology, and my being a total sci-fi/fantasy geek who rereads things like The Mists of Avalon, they just sort of came together.” James is aiming to finish the books by the end of 2017, in time for a Fall 2018 release. At that point, 12-year-old sci-fi-heads and avid literature fans can finally join together and “geek the fuck out.”"
POLITICS,"Richard Cordray, the former head of the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, won the Democratic nomination for governor of Ohio on Tuesday, fending off a challenge from former presidential candidate and House member Dennis Kucinich. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) hand-picked Cordray, a former Ohio attorney general, to run the CFPB and raised money for his campaign. Cordray will face Ohio’s current attorney general, Republican Mike DeWine, in the general election race for the governor’s job. Incumbent John Kasich (R) is term-limited. Kucinich ran heavily on his support of Medicare-for-all and won the support of the progressive group Our Revolution, which grew out of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign. (Sanders himself did not endorse Kucinich.) Kucinich also attacked Cordray for his past support of gun rights, which earned Cordray an ‘A’ rating from the National Rifle Association when he was attorney general. Cordray now supports universal background checks.  Cordray’s campaign fought back with television ads showing former President Barack Obama praising him.   “Rich took on payday lenders, big banks and student loan schemes that profit at your expense,” a female narrator says in the ad. “And he won.” DeWine defeated Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor in $10 million GOP primary that featured both candidates aligning themselves with President Donald Trump. DeWine is a former U.S. senator who ousted Cordray from the attorney general post in 2010. He begins the race as a slight favorite in a state where Trump scored a nine-percentage-point win in 2016. "

ENTERTAINMENT,"Sometimes actions speak louder than words. Priyanka Chopra visited “Watch What Happens Live” on Thursday, and host Andy Cohen decided to take advantage of the “Quantico” star’s close friendship with Meghan Markle. During a game called “Spill the Royal Tea,” Cohen asked Chopra a series of loaded questions about Markle and her upcoming royal wedding to Prince Harry, which Chopra will be attending on May 19. “I don’t want to get you in trouble with the royal family,” Cohen said to Chopra. “I’m just going to ask you a question about Meghan and Harry’s wedding and … if you can’t answer the question, I’ll guess the answer based on your facial expression.” So, when Cohen asked Chopra if Meghan had cried when she found her wedding dress, the former Miss World responded a little like this: Her broad smile prompted both Cohen and fellow guest actor Sebastian Stan to say, “Yes!” During the segment, the audience learned a few other interesting tidbits. Chopra said she’s never met Prince Harry, hasn’t gotten the couple a wedding gift yet and is attracted to redheads. The actress said the color is “kind of my thing.” Yet, one of the biggest bombshells came in the form of another nonverbal response. When Chopra was asked if Markle was a “bridezilla,” the actress reacted like this: We’re sure Markle loved that response."
ARTS & CULTURE," The quaint cover of The Giving Tree, with its loosely sketched lines, speaks to the quiet power of the story. Regardless of what you think of the book’s mildly macabre message –- selflessness comes at a cost –- there’s no refuting that its packaging elegantly matches its themes.  Although there’s value in the mantra that we repeat to children about judging books by their covers, there’s also joy to be had when an illustration perfectly conveys the spirit of a story. This is the basis for Martin Salisbury's new collection, humbly titled 100 Great Children's Picturebooks. A designer, he's focused more on the look of the books than the tales they hold, and has selected those with drawings influenced by everything from Romanticism to Futurism.  Salisbury's selection includes works from around the world, the only criteria being that they were published within the last 100 years. The result is a blend of minimalist designs from Germany, Baroque-inspired frills from France, and soft pastels of Maurice Sendak. The cover of Praia-Mar, a 2011 book from Portugal, is adorned with bold shapes and angular, sunburnt bathers. The softer cover of Jour de neige stars a thoughtful rabbit gazing out a window at a snowy scene.  See these and more below, from Martin Salisbury's 100 Great Children's Picturebooks:"
POLITICS,"Gina Haspel, President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, sought to withdraw herself from consideration to avoid any potential damage to the agency’s reputation and her own, The Washington Post reported Sunday. Haspel is a 30-year CIA veteran widely respected by her colleagues as deputy director. But her past role in the CIA’s use of brutal interrogation measures on terrorism suspects has generated bipartisan criticism on Capitol Hill, where she is scheduled to answer questions during a confirmation hearing next week. As the head of a clandestine base in Thailand in 2002, Haspel oversaw the interrogation of one terror suspect that reportedly included techniques like waterboarding. The torture sessions were videotaped, and Haspel also reportedly played a part in the tapes’ destruction in 2005. The CIA has disputed this, however, saying her superior was responsible for the decision to do so. Haspel was summoned to the White House on Friday to review her role in the controversial program, where she faced “urgent questions” from administration officials about “material being raised in questions from Congress,” according to the Post. Some records from the program, the newspaper reported, show that Haspel “was an enthusiastic supporter of what the CIA was doing.” During the meeting, the report added, Haspel told White House officials she wanted to withdraw her nomination in order to protect the reputation of the agency and so as to not become what she called “the next Ronny Jackson,” referring to the White House physician Trump nominated for secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs who withdrew over allegations of misconduct. The suggestion alarmed White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and legislative affairs director Marc Short, who reportedly rushed to the agency’s headquarters in Langley, Virginia, on Friday to meet with Haspel after she left the White House in order to talk her out of pulling out. By Saturday, the deputy CIA director had agreed to stick with it. Haspel’s last-minute second-guessing of whether to maintain her bid is indicative of the uphill climb her nomination faces in Congress. The prolonged absence of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and the previously stated opposition of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) would give Democrats leverage over her nomination ― if they stick together, that is. According to the Post, Short told Haspel she could still be confirmed despite the questions over her role in the interrogation program. Sanders, meanwhile, tweeted an endorsement of Haspel on Friday. The senior White House aide also accused Democrats of hypocrisy over their opposition to a female nominee.  There is no one more qualified to be the first woman to lead the CIA than 30+ year CIA veteran Gina Haspel. Any Democrat who claims to support women’s empowerment and our national security but opposes her nomination is a total hypocrite"

Photo by Michael Lamont 	Crime novelist Patricia Highsmith was renowned for her intense psychological thrillers, particularly her series featuring the murderer Tom Ripley, but she was also known for her reclusive, abrasive and even hateful personality.  Playwright Joanna Murray-Smith tackles the complexities of Ms. Highsmith's character in this production, a two-hander starring Laura Linney as the novelist and Seth Numrich as a young emissary from Highsmith's publishing company who hopes to sign her on for a next, and likely last novel. 	The play is set in Highsmith's isolated home in Locarno, Switzerland, where she assiduously avoids the world in the company of her cats, drinks and smokes heavily and contemplates her rapidly approaching death.  Needless to say, she is hardly welcoming to the eager young man who has great aspirations for a brilliant career in the publishing world.  In fact, we suspect that Highsmith may even have murderous intentions toward this particular visitor. 	Writing about writers is always a challenge, since their most impressive talents are about words on paper - or possibly clever conversation.  Inevitably, a two-person play on a single set must be inhabited with dualing dialogue and perhaps a hint of mystery.  Murray-Smith accomplishes both of these tasks admirably, as the characters jab and slice at each other with wit and veiled threats.  While their battle occasionally seems slight and sags a bit too often, it never drags unduly. 	On opening night, Linney -- known for her portrayal of more likeable characters like Abigail Adams and the sister in Savages -- seemed to be grasping a bit to find the right tone for the acerbic Highsmith.  But as the evening went on she played the more tender and vulnerable side of the novelist to greater success.  Numrich, as the young man swept into  Highsmith's web, showed a dynamic range and versatility as he parried with Highsmith, quip for quip.  Director Mark Brokaw's evidently light hand in the staging may have softened some of the sharpness of Murray-Smith's script, but did deliver a solidly engaging evening."
ARTS & CULTURE,"If you ask Dorothea Lasky for writing advice you might get the following text message:  Lasky was my very first poetry professor at Columbia, where I'm studying for my MFA. I knew I was getting a teacher of ferocious passion and penetrating psychological insight from her poetry, which I had in read in The New Yorker, the Paris Review and in her four poetry collections. But I wasn't prepared for Dottie. She wears leopard print onesies and more plastic jewelry than all the tickets can win you at a Chuck E Cheese. Her eye contact is ferocious--it'd be lunatic if it wasn't so tender.   A month into our time together, I told Dottie I wasn't writing frequently enough, that I felt tense and was overthinking when I went to write. Her response was to send me a text message every night for the entire month of October, 2013. Here is her iPhone calendar from the time (the orange dots mark nights to ""Order Max Around""):  The text messages contained what she called ""exercises."" That October, I didn't go out on Saturdays. I did Dottie's exercises. One could call them writing prompts, but they were more like lavish, personal rituals. She made me text her photographs of my furniture, my bathroom cabinets' contents, my fridge, my shoe collection, glasses collection, and all of my pens. From this digital temple of my ephemera, she would choose sacramental objects for a ceremony. Every night I turned somersaults, guzzled a rainbow of different fruit juices, plunged into scalding baths--all the while jotting down phrases on a big yellow legal pad. The end of every ritual culminated in a poem. As time passed, a sense of the spiritual and sacred suffused my apartment and all of its contents. It had all become part of my poetry--the thing that mattered most to me in the world. Though Dottie has never been in my apartment, she haunts every lamp, toothbrush, and stuffed animal.  When I told Dottie I wanted to write a big poem, a grand poem, she gave me The Universe Prompt:   The night after I completed the Ninth Universe, I wrote a Tenth. More Universes followed and eventually, with her earlier prompts, they formed the bedrock of my first chapbook, AEONS, winner of the 2014 Poetry Society of America Chapbook competition.  I told Dottie I wanted to interview her on her teaching philosophy on the occasion of the release of AEONS: it's a rare thing for a book of poems to be born in a single classroom. I wanted her to discuss her educational philosophy, which is idiosyncratic in the extreme.  MR: All of your writing advice to me has always felt utterly personal. The writing prompts you gave me required you to study my apartment and also deeply engaged with things that matter a lot to me: animals, neon colors, fruits and vegetables. Do you think you need to learn all about someone before you can help them make art? What is the link between intimacy and teaching--teaching poetry or anything else? And how would you have taught me if we didn't have so much in common? DL: It sounds a little silly to write this in actual words, for public consumption no less, but I do believe we were actually blessed to have found each other in that classroom. As soon as you opened your mouth, I thought, ""Oh, I like him."" And it was fast magic from there on out. It was so easy to do this work with you for a lot of reasons. First of all, your instincts towards the poem are always littered with utter genius. So, when I gave you prompts, I knew you weren't going to change these moments into any old thing.  Second, you are so brilliant, in a way that is different than artistic genius. You have a brilliance in the ways in which you have consumed and can convey information, and you brought to our work all of the great things you have read and thought of, which are many. Third, and most importantly, and most rare, you are more open than anyone I've ever met, you take what is given to you with a kind of open stare, the immortal poet's stare. We had ideal teacher-student intimacy, because we have so much in common yes, but also because your openness made me more open. I didn't have to perform any authority, you weren't testing me, you simply wanted to create and grow, and this made me soft and ready to help you grow.  MR: Well I obviously like that answer. We were very lucky. But what if a teacher has an oversized class and very limited class time, what would your advice be for someone in that situation? DL: I think the key to any sort of good teaching is to utilize the classroom as a performative space and you can make the classroom a stage, no matter how many students you have. Practically speaking, I would tell this teacher to try and give her students as many options towards completing an assignment as she can, with at least one in each of Howard Gardner's types of intelligences (visual/spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, linguistic, logical-mathematical) and then include an opportunity for students to suggest their own alternatives to the assignment. She should also use serious group work, where students have to build complex products towards her learning objectives, suggest each student record her learning in the class, and include several types of semi-public performances so that students can demonstrate what they have learned (i.e., a poetry reading, an art show, a science fair).  MR: How was prompting a long poem into being different than prompting a shorter poem? DL: Poetry exercises are very often about prompting the shorter poem. When I prompted your long poem, it was a relief as a teacher that I knew you would stay with the moment of the poem for a while, that you would consider the issues of it deeply, that you would think about making a tapestry of music that had time to expand. I've always favored the kind of classes that were obsessively focused on one thing, like a class on a particular type of Flowering Maple versus a class on flowers. When you make an exercise for a poet to write a long poem you beg for obsession. As a teacher, this is what I like to beg for.

MR: You're a spiritual person and spiritual poet. Your work with me, as I saw it, was mainly teaching me how to enter and exit a trance. You love astrology, fate, and ritual. Do you think one needs trance states or some engagement with the spiritual realm, to write poetry? DL: When you came to me, you said, ""my mind is blocking me from writing poems,"" and I knew I had to help you rid yourself of the mind. I've always felt that when you tap into the part of the self that writes poems the self becomes beyond the mind. I go back and forth if I think this sort of state is part of the other world or is part of this one. I tend to favor the idea that people are creative from what the world gives them versus just being touched by the divine, because I think the former allows for the possibility that everyone can be creative versus just a chosen few. Whatever we want to call it, I think poets enter a space which is another reality when they write a poem, and that this is a great space to exist in for as long as possible.  MR: And I've heard you self-describe as a hoarder: your wrists are constantly clacking with new bracelets in your purse, and you always carry at least three pairs of glasses at once. Your spirituality seems deeply embedded in this love of physical objects--almost plastic-totem-worship. Could you talk about how material objects play a part in your spirituality and your poetry? How do material objects play a role in your teaching? DL: Yes! You and I have discussed this a lot and have even exchanged many totems. Object-based learning is very important to my pedagogy and part of what I used as a foundation to starting a poetry school I co-direct called The Ashbery Homeschool and what I will use to create future educational programs. I think when we create and think from objects our thoughts have weight that more directly access the imagination. This may seem counterintuitive, as many times we assume thoughts beget thoughts. But I think the physicality and spirituality of an object (bearing with it the culture, individuals, and society that made it) is a symbol of the object-like schemata that exists in our imaginations as we create new things. I guess this reason alone explains my (very overwhelming) hoarding tendencies.  DL: OK, now is my turn to turn the tables on you. After we did this work together,  I wonder: did it influence your future writing in any way? Also, you are a teacher too and will be teaching writing semi-full-time next year as an instructor in the Undergraduate Writing Program at Columbia. Will you use any of what we did in your classroom? MR: Of course it influenced my future writing! I think I'm now a writer of faith--faith in the senses. If halfway down the page my hand stops writing, all I need to do is perk my ears up or reach into a cabinet and pull out a trinket, and my senses will provide me the rest of the poem--the world will provide me the rest of the poem.  As for my future teaching, I want my students to be swept up in their writing projects, for their writing to be their companion, as AEONS was for me during our time together. I also want them to be comfortable radically revising and reimagining their projects midstream as you taught me to be."
BUSINESS,"Everybody knows that you bury a bad news story by putting it out late on Friday afternoon. If it’s really bad, you might look for a Friday afternoon that is also drowning in other news stories ― like, say, the inauguration of a reality-TV star as U.S. president. The news that came out Friday from the Superior Court of Ontario, where Ecuadorian communities are trying to enforce an Ecuadorian environmental judgment against fleeing polluter Chevron Corp., was actually a mix of good and bad. But the bad part was ugly. In the decision, Judge Glenn Hainey excused Chevron’s Canadian subsidiary (Chevron Canada) from the action, holding that it even though it is wholly-owned and controlled by Chevron (through a chain of wholly-owned, non-operational shell companies), it was not an “exigible” asset of Chevron that could be taken to satisfy Chevron’s debt to the Ecuadorians. In what is perhaps the latest flourish in the corporate personhood movement that brought us Citizens United, the court held: “Chevron Canada is not an asset of Chevron. It is a separate legal person. It is not an asset of any other person including its own parent.” Judge Hainey essentially ruled that a multinational fleeing a valid court judgment that hides its assets in a maze of paper subsidiaries can completely insulate itself from paying its obligations, while losing nothing in terms of profit or control. While the Ecuadorian communities who have battled Chevron for 24 years can be trusted to push past this nonsense and find ways to ensure full collection of their judgment, the decision stands as a dangerous precedent for the many other corporate accountability claims that are currently underway in Canadian and other courts. It says to those claims that even if you prevail at the jurisdiction and the merits/liability stages, and even if you sustain your victory on appeal, here is yet another barrier that could prevent you from merely collecting on a successful judgment. The chill this could cast more broadly on efforts to enforce human rights norms is obvious. The Ecuadorians are in Canada, remember, because Chevron pulled all its assets out of Ecuador when it realized it was going to lose after a robust, eight-year environmental damages proceeding. (It lost because the evidence against it was overwhelming: hundreds upon hundreds of open-air oil waste pits that, Chevron cannot deny, were built by its predecessor Texaco as the operator of a concession, and were literally designed to overflow into local waterways and drinking water sources, expressly rejecting along the way common sense environmental measures that, for a few million dollars, would have protected the lives of tens of thousands of people.) Even before the judgment against it was affirmed on appeal and by Ecuador’s Supreme Court, Chevron declared it would never pay (which by itself is illegal and contrary to the rule of law, we should not forget) and instead, with an army of literally thousands of lawyers and operatives, launched a massive demonization campaign to recast of the global public narrative about the case, framing the life-long social justice activists who led the case as a greedy and villainous fraudsters, the affected communities themselves as either “irrelevant” (as Chevron has described them) or criminally complicit, and Chevron itself as the true victim of the whole situation. Sadly, but perhaps not surprisingly, U.S. courts, and the legal media, ate it all up. So the Ecuadorians wind up in Canada, in exercise of their fundamental right to enforce their judgment wherever they choose. (Disabusing Americans and their institutions of the deeply-held belief that a favorite son like Chevron can do no wrong is not water the Ecuadorians have any obligation to carry.) In Canada, the Ecuadorians are not arguing liability—that was already decided in Ecuador. They are simply seeking enforcement against Chevron’s assets in the jurisdiction, namely Chevron Canada. The issue in this context is not the more well-known doctrine of “piercing the corporate veil.” The issue is simply debt collection. Canada has a statute designed to speed the execution of final money judgments, which broadly allows the court “to seize and sell any equitable or other right, property, interest or equity of redemption in or in respect of any goods, chattels, or personal property.” The Supreme Court of Canada has been clear that the law must be interpreted broadly to empower the courts to “facilitate the collection of a debt within the jurisdiction”; the law “calls for assistance, not barriers.” The Supreme Court—in this very case, which already took a trip up there on appeal on almost the same issue—held that a legitimate and “core” aspect of the communities’ case “is for the enforcement of Chevron’s obligation to pay the foreign judgment using the shares and assets of Chevron Canada to satisfy its parent corporation’s debt obligation.” None of the requirements of the corporate veil-piercing doctrine (exercise of dominion and control, abuse such as undercapitalization) are even relevant; the question of what the corporate subsidiary did or didn’t do doesn’t even get asked. The subsidiary is simply an asset of the parent, held (or beneficially owned) by the parent and thus available to satisfy a debt owed by that parent. There isn’t much wiggle-room here, but somehow Judge Hainey avoids what should have been an easy decision in the Ecuadorians’ favor. How exactly he does this is a bit confusing. While he makes the extraordinary claim quoted above, suggesting that subsidiary corporations are not assets even of their direct corporate parents, he never returns to this notion. Ultimately, he appears to rely on the chain of wholly-owned shell companies in various jurisdictions around the world that technically lie between Chevron and Chevron Canada. These are truly paper-only shells without employees, offices, operations, or any other substance; as memorably described by Chevron’s expert witness on its own operations, Chevron’s subsidiary structure “varies literally on a daily basis. . . . we create and dissolve companies constantly.” The law looks past such pass-through forms to the real “beneficial owner” of assets all the time, in countless contexts. And Chevron doesn’t deny that it is the exclusive “beneficial owner” of 100% of Chevron Canada. Hainey throws up a lot of smoke to avoid saying outright that he is embracing Chevron’s use of these unapologetically substance-less shells as a defense to beneficial ownership. He cites a Canadian case for the proposition that a corporation’s “shares confer no right to its underlying assets”—but this is beside the point, because the communities were seeking the shares themselves as the property. It repeats many times that “the Execution Act, which is a procedural statute, does not create any rights in property” and “does not give Chevron any interest, beneficial or otherwise, in the shares or assets of Chevron Canada.” But no statute need give Chevron anything—it already owns (beneficially) the shares; the procedure provided by the Act is all that is needed. Hainey then cites three cases that he claims made findings similar to his: two are completely inapposite, involving either a normal veil-piercing analysis or involving substantive, non-shell companies; the third appears to be an outlier, in which the court in its discretion declined to seize certain subsidiary company accounts, but certainly never laid down any rule saying courts could not do so. The court weakly tries to distinguish the multiple cases cited by the communities where Canadian courts have looked past shell-company formalities to beneficial ownership, finding irrelevant differences or dismissing them based on circular or conclusory reasoning. For example, one case was accurately described by the court as “involv[ing] the enforcement of a recognition order against bank accounts and real property [which was not just held by a shell company, but by an operating charitable foundation] that were determined by the court to be beneficially owned by the judgment-debtor.” But Judge Hainey’s response, in its entirety, is that the case “does not support the plaintiffs’ position that the Execution Act creates substantive property rights.” As just noted, that’s not the plaintiffs’ position. Hainey studiously ignores the fact that the case is directly on-point with respect to beneficial ownership (indeed makes its beneficial ownership finding with citation to the Execution Act). Hainey claims another case is distinguishable because the debtor in that case “had a legally recognized residual interest in the shares,” whereas “Chevron has no legally recognized interest in Chevron Canada’s assets.” This either misleadingly focuses on Chevron Canada assets as opposed to Chevron Canada itself, as already discussed, or is once again conclusory, simply ignoring Chevron’s clear beneficial ownership interest in Chevron Canada itself. It’s a lot of effort to get to a bizarre, unfair, and dangerous result. If companies can completely insulate themselves from having to pay their debts simply by holding assets in meaningless shell companies, then, in the era of Mossack Fonseca, we might as well drop the idea of debt collection entirely, at least for strategically organized multinational corporations. Remember, we are not talking about arguably difficult and policy-laden questions regarding the responsibility of parents for the conduct of their subsidiaries, as we are in the context of liability. Here liability is established; we are just talking about how to enforce as a practical matter what the justice system has already ordered. And why all this Herculean effort by the court to drop Chevron Canada? This question is particularly pressing given that the court appears to recognize that it can’t toss the case entirely after the Canadian Supreme Court expressly said the case can and should proceed. So Hainey allowed the case to proceed against Chevron, the U.S. parent that doesn’t have any assets in Canada (aside from Chevron Canada, of course). As news of the decision goes around, I keep getting the question: what’s the point? Why recognize a foreign judgment if there are no assets to enforce against? This is where the not-so-bad and even good part of the decision comes in. The Supreme Court of Canada has already answered the what’s-the-point question and has said, basically, it’s none of our business. If the communities want to recognize the judgment in Canada, that’s their right. There is a lot of wisdom in this position. First of all, the Ontario court’s obsequious embrace of Chevron’s shell-company strategy might well be overturned, in which case Chevron Canada returns to the picture as an “exigible” asset. Even if this were not to happen, there might be other discoverable assets of Chevron in Canada, and there may be opportunities available through reciprocal procedures with other countries. Moreover, recognition of the judgment by Canada could provide a critical counterweight to the shameful interference in the process by U.S. courts, which famously—and conveniently in favor of “a company of considerable importance to our economy” (in the words of the presiding district court judge)—accepted jurisdiction in a collateral “civil racketeering” or RICO lawsuit against the Ecuadorians and their lawyers, accepted paid-for “fact” testimony from Chevron, denied the defendants a jury after Chevron dropped all money damages in the case, and then went ahead anyway and declared the Ecuadorian judgment to be fraudulent. For these reasons, the affected communities who won the judgment are actually celebrating the Ontario decision for its basic affirmance of their right to enforce their judgment in Canada, no matter how long that might take. “The bottom line is that we are now one big step closer to our goal in Canada of forcing Chevron to comply with the rule of law and be held accountable for its environmental crimes in Ecuador,” said Carlos Guaman, the leader of the Amazon Defense Coalition, the grass roots organization that brought the Ecuadorian lawsuit and is responsible for collecting on the judgment and implementing a court-ordered remediation of the pollution. The affected communities have spent 24 years fighting through initial dismissals, forum transfers, a strenuous eight-year trial on the merits, multiple layers of appeal in Ecuador, and a multiple layers of appeal on preliminary issues in Canada. And while these 24 years have required much sacrifice, they have also seen great victories: the communities have a final $12 billion judgment, they have been celebrated by the Goldman Environmental Foundation and many others, and Chevron’s pollution has been exposed in almost every leading media outlet in the world. Indeed, the communities themselves have only grown stronger over the many years of struggle. The communities apparently still have a road to travel to recover on their judgment in Canada, but they are getting ever closer."
BUSINESS,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Donald Trump administration has launched a national security investigation into car and truck imports that could lead to new U.S. tariffs similar to those imposed on imported steel and aluminum in March. The national security probe under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 would investigate whether vehicle and parts imports were threatening the industry’s health and ability to research and develop new, advanced technologies, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. “There is evidence suggesting that, for decades, imports from abroad have eroded our domestic auto industry,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement, promising a “thorough, fair and transparent investigation.” Higher tariffs could be particularly painful for Asian automakers including Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co, Honda Motor Co and Hyundai Motor Co, which count the United States as a key market, and the announcement sparked a broad sell-off in automakers’ shares across the region.  The governments of Japan, China and South Korea said they would monitor the situation, while Beijing, which is increasingly eyeing the United States as a potential market for its cars, added that it would defend its interests. “China opposes the abuse of national security clauses, which will seriously damage multilateral trade systems and disrupt normal international trade order,” Gao Feng, spokesman at the Ministry of Commerce, said at a regular news briefing on Thursday which focused largely on whether Beijing and Washington are making any progress in their growing trade dispute. “We will closely monitor the situation under the U.S. probe and fully evaluate the possible impact and resolutely defend our own legitimate interests.” The probe comes as Trump courts voters in the U.S. industrial heartland ahead of mid-term elections later this year, and opens a new front in his “America First” trade agenda aimed at clawing back manufacturing jobs lost to overseas competitors. It could raise the costs for overseas automakers to export vehicles and parts to the world’s second-largest auto market. Growing trade tensions over cars and car parts, particularly with China, could raise risks for U.S. companies expanding their presence in the country, signs of which are already emerging. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Ford Motor Co’s imported vehicles were being held up at Chinese ports, adding to a growing list of U.S. products facing issues at China’s borders. The majority of vehicles sold in the United States by Japanese and South Korean automakers are produced there, but most firms also export to the U.S. from plants in Asia, Mexico, Canada and other countries. Roughly one-third of all U.S. vehicle imports last year were from Asia. In addition to recently imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports, the administration has threatened tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods over intellectual property complaints, and Beijing has vowed to respond. The administration is also trying to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement to return more auto production to the United States. Commerce said the new probe would determine whether lost domestic production had weakened the U.S. “internal economy” and its ability to develop connected vehicle systems, autonomous vehicles, fuel cells, electric motors and batteries, and advanced manufacturing processes. In a separate statement, Trump said: “Core industries such as automobiles and automotive parts are critical to our strength as a Nation.” A Trump administration official said before the announcement that the expected move was aimed partly at pressuring Canada and Mexico to make concessions in talks to update the NAFTA that have languished in part over auto provisions, as well as pressuring Japan and the European Union, which also export large numbers of vehicles to the United States. An ad hoc industry group representing the largest Japanese, German and other foreign automakers called “Here for America,” criticized the effort. “To our knowledge, no one is asking for this protection. This path leads inevitably to fewer choices and higher prices for cars and trucks in America,” said John Bozzella, chief executive of Global Automakers, a trade group representing Toyota, Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Hyundai Motor Co and others. A Toyota spokeswoman said that the company was monitoring the situation. Chinese automaker Geely Holding Group urged free trade practices for the auto industry, which is built on a complex supply chain under which vehicle components for any given car often originates from numerous countries. “As a global manufacturer, Geely Holding Group is in favor of free trade and open markets. Free trade creates jobs, wealth and economic growth,” a spokesman said, adding that its plant in South Carolina to produce its Volvo brand cars showed its commitment to the country. Shares in Toyota, Honda and Hyundai each fell roughly 3 percent in local trade following the announcement, while Mazda Motor Corp, which does not have any U.S. production capacity at the moment, tumbled more than 5 percent. Late last week, Japan’s automakers’ association urged its export partners to keep tariffs on vehicles and components low and maintain free trade relationships. Roughly 12 million cars and trucks were produced in the United States last year, while the country imported 8.3 million vehicles worth $192 billion. This included 2.4 million from Mexico, 1.8 million from Canada, 1.7 million from Japan, 930,000 from South Korea and 500,000 from Germany, according to U.S. government statistics. At the same time, the United States exported nearly 2 million vehicles worldwide worth $57 billion. German automakers Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG and BMW AG all have large U.S. assembly plants. The United States is the second-biggest export destination for German auto manufacturers after China, while vehicles and car parts are Germany’s biggest source of export income. Asked if the measures would hit Mexico and Canada, a Mexican source close to the NAFTA talks said: “That probably is going to be the next battle.” (Reporting by David Shepardson and Jeff Mason; Additional reporting by James Oliphant, Makini Brice and David Lawder in Washington, Anthony Esposito in Mexico City; Naomi Tajitsu in Tokyo; Yawen Chen and Norihiko Shirouzu in Beijing; Hyunjoo Jin in Seoul; Writing by David Lawder and David Shepardson; Editing by Jonathan Oatis, Peter Cooney & Kim Coghill)"
ARTS & CULTURE,"Last week The Washington Post reported on a Virginia bill proposal that would force school districts to highlight which books on a given syllabus contain sensitive or “sexually explicit” material. “All local school boards would be required to set up a way for parents to opt out of objectionable materials; teachers would have to provide replacement texts for those who ask for them,” Washington Post writes. News of the bill proposal, reportedly being drafted and considered by the Virginia Board of Education, comes shortly after two classic novels were pulled from the bookshelves of Accomack County Public Schools in Virginia.  The proposal resembles a bill that the state’s governor vetoed last year. Nevertheless, its implications have educators and activists vocally worried. The chief concern: such a rule could prevent young readers from accessing stories of literary and educational merit. Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye, and Herman Hesse’s Siddhartha -- celebrated classics -- are among the many books that’ve been banned or challenged due to sexual content since 2014. And, in the past, books deemed “sexually explicit” have often been titles featuring queer characters or women asserting their sexual personhood. For access to be cut off to such stories could be damaging to kids who otherwise have no way of meeting fictional representations of their own experiences. According to the American Library Association, Peter Parnell and Justin Richardson’s And Tango Makes Three, a picture book about two male penguins raising a baby penguin, is regularly featured on the organization's annual list of most-challenged titles. If a progressive book (or, at least, an innocuous one) is regularly red-flagged, it seems that red-flagging could put any title -- classic or new and innovative -- at risk."
BUSINESS,"One thing is certain in any business – not everyone you have to deal with will be like you, or will like you (and vice versa). These people may include one of your business partners, an investor, a key vendor, or even one of your best customers. In my role as a business advisor, I see more and more how business people must bridge these differences to accomplish shared business goals. We have all heard the stories of business disasters that result from people who are so different that they can’t get along. Some of these are legendary, including the Steve Jobs differences with John Sculley. Some are more current, such as the travails of Uber investors challenging founder Travis Kalanick, and the daily political leadership struggles surrounding President Donald Trump. On a more positive note, as the business world becomes a global space, all of us have to learn to live and work with people of very different cultures, religions, political opinions, as well as different generations and genders. You have to manage and operate within more and more diverse teams, and your success in a career, or in building your business, depends on it. Thus I was pleased to see these challenges addressed directly in a new book, “How to Work With and Lead People Not Like You,” by Kelly McDonald, a well-known marketing and communications expert who specializes in multicultural and diversity marketing. She offers a set of strategies and tools for communicating across cultural and other barriers, including people you don’t like: In all cases, it’s important to be positive and maintain a can-do attitude. People avoid negativity and they are drawn to positivity. You can become a role model, a leader, and an ally for many team members which will lead to breakthroughs and results with even the most non-compatible situations. A positive mental attitude will also improve your health, and add years to your life. Just remember that you have a business or a career to run. Experts are convinced that a diverse workforce, including people with different values and different perspectives, leads to better decisions and solutions – ultimately growing business opportunities, profits, and satisfaction. Diversity isn’t going away. Learn to deal with it now, and be the leader you always wanted to be."
POLITICS,"New guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of the Interior now prohibit staff members from informing private interests when they must obtain a permit before they can develop properties where activities may affect habitats of endangered species. A memorandum issued last month by the Fish and Wildlife Service principal deputy director, Greg Sheehan, declared that it’s “not appropriate” for staff to tell developers when they need to obtain such a permit — even though it may be required by law in many circumstances. Under a section of the 1973 Endangered Species Act, businesses and individuals must request what’s called an “incidental take permit” if they believe their developments could interfere with the habitats of endangered species. Sheehan insists in his memo that it’s the “decision of the applicant” whether or not to apply for such a permit. Staff members should not use “mandatory language (e.g., a permit is ‘required’),” the memo warns. “The biological, legal, and economic risk assessment regarding whether to seek a permit belongs with the private party determining how to proceed,” Sheehan said. Staffers will still be able to provide “critical technical assistance” when it’s requested, according to the memo. The memo also appears to sharply limit situations where such permits may be required. That includes only cases “where a non-federal project is likely to result in a ‘take’ of a listed species of fish or wildlife ... habitat modification, in and of itself, does not necessarily constitute take,” according to the memo. That would seem to imply such a decision would rely on the judgment of a private interest with a commercial business at stake.   Sheehan was the official who announced to trophy hunting lobby group Safari Club International in Tanzania last year that the Trump administration was lifting an Obama-era ban on elephant trophies from two African nations, Zimbabwe and Zambia.  Donald Trump later held off on the action, but the ban was officially lifted again on a “case-by-case basis” in March. He’s considered among the Interior officials “behind the curtain who are really, really changing our public lands and setting a future direction that may or may not be consistent with what the law requires,” Jim Lyons, a research scholar at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, told The Revelator. Environmental advocates have criticized Sheehan’s newest edict as a way to weaken regulations with the kind of single-handed action that has been a hallmark of the Trump administration. Noah Greenwald of the environmental nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity told The Hill that he believes it will be harder to enforce requirements protecting habitats of endangered species because there will no longer be a record of permit recommendations. The memo is the latest erosion of wildlife protections by the Trump administration.  The administration is also battling blanket safeguards when a species is declared threatened. Under the Endangered Species Act, once a species is listed as threatened, a series of protections automatically go into effect. Under a proposed new rule, specific protections would be decided on a case by case basis. An endangered species is at risk of extinction, while a threatened species is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. Threatened species include such animals as manatees, sea otters, the Guadalupe fur seal, wood bison, the gray wolf, the grizzly, the polar bear and the northern spotted owl. There are more than 300 threatened animal and plant species in the U.S. More than 500 animal species are endangered in the U.S. Last month, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke tapped Susan Combs — a rancher and fierce opponent of the Endangered Species Act with strong ties to the oil industry — to serve as acting secretary for fish, wildlife and parks. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"The day Donald Trump announced his first travel ban, affecting entry into the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries, Bassel Almadani made a sign that read, “My Syrian father delivered 3,000 U.S. babies,” and headed to the airport.  The frontman of the soul group Bassel & The Supernaturals comes from a family of immigrants and wants to honor his heritage through both protest and performance. He’s one of eight artists participating in a South by Southwest show organized to represent each of the countries affected by Trump’s ban.  “I can’t forget the fact that I’m a product of Syrian immigrants. My family would not be in the same circumstance if this ban was in place when they were making the moves that they needed to in order to be here,” Almadani told The Huffington Post.  The secret is out! We're officially on @SXSW! Honored to represent #Syria in this incredible showcase featuring artists from the 7 nations targeted by the immigration ban. #MusicUnites . ContraBanned: #MusicUnites at SXSW Friday, 3/17 @ Palm Door on Sixth A post shared by Bassel & The Supernaturals (@basselmusic) on Mar 3, 2017 at 2:39pm PST This isn’t Almadani’s first act of musical protest. In February, he worked with Chicago’s Inner-City Muslim Action Network to organize a show called Refugee Remix. There, he met Libyan-American hip-hop artist Khaled M., who will also perform at SXSW’s Contrabanned show. The lineup was released on March 8, two days after Trump’s revised travel ban was announced.  “Music has always been a medium for celebrating love and unity, but it is also a powerful vehicle for addressing social and political injustice in a way that builds up communities instead of turning them against one another,” the festival’s site reads.  The show was announced shortly after SXSW issued an invitation letter and performance agreement that was criticized as threatening towards immigrants. The festival has since amended its language and issued an apology.  Now, along with a pop duo from Somalia and Canada, three Iranian performers, and artists from  Libya and Iraq, Almadani and his band will play funky soul music from its new album, “Elements,” for attendees in Austin.  “Soul music is effective, when you create that emotional connection to your audience. It creates a personality, especially for an issue that feels so distant for people,” Almadani said. “As someone who was born and raised in the States, and plays a more traditionally American style of music, I feel like I have an ability to have a conversation with a demographic who otherwise maybe isn’t hearing enough of it, or doesn’t have a lot of great resources around this issue.” While many of Almadani’s songs aim to comment on loss, isolation and recovery more broadly, he’s also written songs directly about his relatives in Syria. His song “Lost” is an ode to his cousin, who was killed by crossfire in Syria. “That was a really difficult circumstance for me to wrap my head around,” Almadani said. “Especially because I wasn’t there, or able to contribute to anything. It was hard to find a sense of closure or peace through any of it.” But through his music, he was able to, and he hopes his lyrics resonate with all listeners who have lived through personal loss.   Shades of Gray ▫️ @tystephanodesigns A post shared by F▲▲RROW (@faarrow) on Dec 13, 2016 at 12:53pm PST “Lost” is also the name of a 2016 EP released by Faarrow ― Somalian-Canadian sisters Siham and Iman Hashi, who write soulful pop songs featuring African percussion.  “Because of our story, being former refugees, the entire theme of our EP is an underdog story,” Iman told HuffPost. But the sisters want the whole of their identities ― as immigrants, as women, as emphatic fans of pop greats like Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston ― to be communicated in their songs.  “Our mom was playing pop music since we were born. Michael Jackson was our everything. If we weren’t listening to Somali music, we were listening to pop music,” Siham said.  Although their interest and talent was evident from an early age, the duo was discouraged from pursuing a career in music.  “It really wasn’t a possibility in our minds, because the culture that we come from. We just thought it was something that was never going to happen, it was so out of reach,” Siham said. “We’re the black sheep of the family. We’re the only ones who decided to take the musical, artistic route.” While Siham and Iman avoid overtly political song lyrics ― the band’s upbeat sound is meant to inspire and unite listeners ― their success has provided them with a platform to discuss their politics, and call attention to issues that matter to them, including the drought that is currently ravaging Somalia.  “Everything that’s going on this country, and everything that’s going on in Somalia, it just ― it’s kind of crazy,” Iman said. “What is really the most important thing, to us as humans? We’re preventing people from coming here, that are in such dire situations. And we’re focused on banning them for reasons that aren’t even real. I feel like it’s our duty and responsibility to always talk about it.” In addition to performances by the participating bands, SXSW’s Contabanned showcase will feature a panel discussion centered on the travel ban. The event is organized by Tamizdat, globalFest, and PRI’s The World. "
ENTERTAINMENT,"As Allison Mack and Keith Raniere await trial, new details have emerged about how the “Smallville” actress ended up in an alleged sex cult in the first place. The Hollywood Reporter interviewed people for an in-depth look at Mack’s alleged role in DOS — short for Dominus Obsequious Sororium or Master Over Slave Women — which has been called a secret society in the supposed self-help group Nxivm. Mack and Raniere, the founder of Nxivm, have been charged with sex trafficking, sex-trafficking conspiracy, and forced-labor conspiracy for their involvement in the alleged sex cult. So how did Mack go from a TV fan favorite to potential felon? It started in late 2006, when she attended a two-day introduction to Jness in Vancouver. The program was billed as a “women’s movement” workshop within Nxivm and the then-23-year-old actress attended with thousands of other people around the world. Mack was living in Canada as she filmed “Smallville” and it was her co-star, Kristin Kreuk, who brought her along. Kreuk, who played Lana Lang on the CW show, has admitted to being in Nxivm but denies any involvement in or knowledge of the secret sorority. She tweeted a statement explaining that she left the group years ago and has declined to comment further. Susan Dones, a former Nxivm member and “field trainer” who had her own center in Washington state, tells THR that Raniere instructed members to roll out the red carpet for Mack. Nxivm’s president, Nancy Salzman, was speaking at the event and had her daughter Lauren seek out the young actress. “By the end of the weekend, Lauren and Allison were like best friends,” Dones, who left the group in 2009, recalls. When the seminar concluded, Mack was invited to fly to Albany, N.Y., on a private jet to meet Raniere, whose teachings she had been hearing about all weekend. Mack accepted the offer, as she was told he could help her with her acting career. Apparently, this was a rare move even when attempting to recruit VIPs. A few weeks later, Dones visited the corporate offices and training facility outside Albany, and she was surprised to see Mack still there: “[Allison] said she was having a great time.” “Her celebrity was her appeal,” cult specialist Rick Ross tells THR. “There were other women who were pretty, but she was the one who was so poised, so good on camera. She was somebody who could really sell it.” Mack, 35, has been in the entertainment industry for the better part of her life. She started acting at age 4 and was enrolled at the Young Actors Space in Los Angeles. (Leonardo DiCaprio and Keri Russell are a few notable names who attended the performing-arts academy.) Someone who worked with Mack — but didn’t want to be named — tells THR she was “as normal as ‘normal’ can be in this business … Her parents were just like, ‘This is what she wanted to do.’” Mack was 18 when she landed the role of Chloe Sullivan on “Smallville,” which ran from 2001 to 2011. It was in her fifth season that she attended the Nxivm conference, and some friends say it was because she was looking for something more. “She was so hungry for something bigger, some kind of sign [that would show] the purpose and meaning of life,” “Step by Step” actress Christine Lakin tells THR — the two were friends as fellow child actors in the ’90s. Some friends say Mack was insecure about not going to college and wanted to get knowledge elsewhere. “I have a tendency to say I am stupid. I [have become] very comfortable chalking things up to the fact that I don’t have a ‘proper education,’” Mack wrote on her blog in 2007. “The truth is … I am an eternal student, and I am loving all the opportunities I have to grow.” One of her former roommates in Vancouver also tells the publication she was looking for mentorship: “Allison had such a desire to be a strong businesswoman and have a mentor.” That’s exactly what Mack has said she found in Raniere. In an interview last year, she credited him with helping her cope with the “overwhelming and intimidating” fame she experienced from ”Smallville.” “I have a wonderful teacher and mentor named Keith Raniere, who really gave me some incredible guidance. I think everyone needs a mentor,” she said. “I don’t think any of us really know the answers without a little bit of wisdom. If you aren’t willing to be humble enough to seek wisdom from other people, I think you’re missing a lot of really incredible opportunities to build a certain amount of depth and value in your life that you wouldn’t have if you didn’t have somebody to help guide you.” But some sources say Mack’s fame is exactly what drew Raniere to her. One former Nxivm member tells THR that in 2009, Raniere sought to mimic more of what Scientology was doing. “The group’s leaders were studying Scientology and saying they wanted to be more like them — more visually appealing, more streamlined, more like the cool kids,” says the source. “And they wanted people who were attractive and compelling; that’s why they went after people like Allison Mack.” Rick Ross adds, “She was the Tom Cruise of Nxivm.” When Smallville ended, Mack purchased a house near Albany, and some say her ties to Raniere and Nxivm became only deeper. “She really believed that teaching the difference between men and women was good, that it was pure and noble,” says a former consultant. “I don’t think any of us saw where it was going, that it was teaching women to be subservient.” Mack allegedly attempted to recruit friends and fellow celebrities to join the group, and if those close to her pushed back, sources say she usually cut them off. “Her personality [increasingly] turned inside out,” a former employee says, alleging that Mack began berating and humiliating her for small instances. This person says Mack was just as hard on herself, proclaiming at one point she would never choose to have kids because she was “so f***ed up.” It’s believed Mack became much more intimate with Raniere by 2010. Susan Dones alleges she knew firsthand that he kept a harem of more than a dozen women. One former member of this intimate group believes she saw signs that Mack was part of it. “I took one look at Allison, and I knew she was involved romantically and sexually with Keith,” the woman alleges. “She had a gray pallor that was common to Keith’s women because they all start to get a little sickly. I know I did. They drop weight. Their heads get too big for their bodies so they become bobbleheads. It’s scary looking.” Three of the women in DOS that Raniere trusted most — called “the wolf pack” by Dones — left for various reasons from 2013 to 2016, and Mack appeared to fill this void. Frank Parlato, who briefly did PR for Nxivm and was the first person to expose DOS on his blog last year, says Mack “had the ability to bring women to Raniere’s bed. She procured some startling beauties.” He alleges Mack had more than 50 slaves, which was the same number cited by federal prosecutors. OneTHR source claimed to have spoken with two of Mack’s alleged slaves. “These slaves said Mack was incredibly intimidating, cruel and punitive,” the source claims, adding that Mack blackmailed them to sleep with Raniere. “You made a lifetime vow!” Mack screamed, according to the source. “She berated them and told them they were worth nothing, that they were weak, and couldn’t uphold their word.” Both women allegedly were branded and in Mack’s “slave pod.” People who know Mack seem to be split on whether she should be viewed as a victim herself, or simply as a co-conspirator. Some are worried the actress is so brainwashed, she might take the fall for Raniere by saying DOS was her idea and that he had no knowledge of it. Raniere has pleaded not guilty on all counts, and some reports suggest that Mack is working on a plea deal. A status update has been set for June with a trial date of Oct. 1. They could each face up to 15 years in prison if convicted. Read more from Yahoo Entertainment: This post was originally published on Yahoo Entertainment."
BUSINESS,"America is known as a land of not just opportunity, but also as a center of entrepreneurial innovation and a magnet for talent from all over the world. Personally, my experience as an immigrant set me up for entrepreneurial success.  My backstory: I immigrated to America from my native Bulgaria as a young college student. After graduating, I worked for five years as an engineer at Google before founding a successful venture-backed technology company, Leanplum. There are five life skills I learned from immigrating to the US that shaped me into a better CEO. Whether or not you share this experience, these skills may help you found and grow your company as well.  1. Take Risks  Immigrating is the ultimate risk. Most people can’t imagine a scarier move than leaving their home country to live in foreign land with a different language, where traditional social networks and safety nets are absent.  I moved to America in 2003 to attend college in New York. I was 19. My entire worldly belongings fit into two suitcases, and I had borrowed thousands of dollars from my family to help pay for college. But even though this was a massive risk for me and my family, it was worth it because it enabled me to pursue opportunities that I never could have achieved in my home country.  In a way, being an immigrant prepared me for the risks and stresses of running a startup. Compared to the emotional commitment of asking your friends and family to help fund your education, pitching VC investors is easy!  2. Be Resourceful  Immigrating to the US forced me to become more resourceful. Out of necessity, I constantly had to adapt, solve problems, figure things out, and generally learn how to survive and thrive in a new country.  In the same way, entrepreneurs learn every day by putting out fires, finding new solutions, and pivoting away from failure. Being an entrepreneur requires continuously adapting and taking on a mindset of 24x7 learning. At the same time, you must find new ways to solve problems and serve in every role imaginable, from CTO to CFO to customer service rep.  The best entrepreneurs, like immigrants, are relentlessly self-reliant — they proactively shape circumstances to suit their goals.  3. Believe in Your Vision  When I first arrived in the US, I learned the radical lesson of mental de-cluttering. While in college, I worked 20 hours per week in the cafeteria during the graveyard shift, the maximum time allowed to work on campus as a full-time student, all while triple majoring in math, computer science, and computational science. I only had time for working, studying, eating, and sleeping. I didn’t overthink my situation — just did what I had to do to succeed. This is the same mentality as entrepreneurship.  When I started Leanplum, I was in the same mentality as when I was 19 — non-stop coding, talking to customers, eating, and sleeping. Starting and scaling Leanplum has been one of the happiest and most thrilling adventures of my life, because it has given me the chance to pursue a specific vision for what I wanted to achieve, with focus, determination, and a great team.  4. Move Between Cultures  I’ve been privileged to understand and appreciate multiple cultures, finding ways to operate effectively across cultural boundaries. Being an immigrant has made me a better person, as well as a better entrepreneur.  Even if you never move to a new country, learning another language, working with a diverse team, and respecting unique cultural differences can help improve your sense of empathy, enhance your tolerance of ambiguity, and help you understand other people’s intentions. Being an immigrant has helped me relate to people better and given me greater confidence in working with individuals from all walks of life.  5. See Things Differently  Perhaps the greatest life skill I’ve learned from immigrating is a sense of perspective. There seems to be something about the experience of being an immigrant that makes people have a broader perspective and embrace innovative ideas. Many of America’s most innovative entrepreneurs have this “immigrant” mindset. Steve Jobs was the son of an immigrant. Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, and Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, are also immigrants. Immigrants have started more than half of America’s billion-dollar startup companies.    America must not lose this incredibly valuable competitive advantage. We must continue to be a welcoming place for immigrants, especially for the entrepreneurial immigrants who invest so much to start new businesses, create new jobs, launch whole new industries, and transform our sense of possibility of what life can be like.

ENTERTAINMENT,"Johnny Galecki is about to remind us it didn’t all start with the big bang. The actor returns to the roots of his TV stardom when he appears on the reboot of “Roseanne” next Tuesday. The episode reunites him and small-screen love Darlene (Sara Gilbert). The two shared a complicated relationship ― and daughter ― in the original series until its end in 1997. A new promo (below) shows Galecki’s now-scruffy David Healy appearing at Darlene’s window and later saying an awkward hello to Darlene’s dad, Dan (John Goodman). ABC’s episode description says that David surprises their daughter, Harris, (Emma Kenney) for her birthday after being absent for years. We also know that David notices the Conners’ unchanged interior. In a trailer before the revival’s premiere, he tells Darlene, “They kept everything exactly the same as it was when you guys were kids.” To which Darlene responded: “It’s a decorating choice called poverty.” Those two. Lots of familar faces... and some new ones, too! #Roseanne pic.twitter.com/K5EzYx9bis Gilbert and Galecki played occasional booty-call partners in Galecki’s enduring sitcom smash, “The Big Bang Theory.” We’ll see if sparks fly in their other TV universe on Tuesday."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Director Milos Forman, responsible for Oscar-winning films like “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” and “Amadeus,” died Friday in Connecticut at the age of 86. Forman was born in 1932 in what is now the Czech Republic. Relatives raised him after his mother and the man he then believed to be his father were killed in Nazi death camps. Later, Forman discovered that his actual biological father had survived the war and ended up in Peru. After graduating from film school in Prague in the mid-1950s, Forman began his career writing and assisting on other filmmakers’ projects. He started directing his own movies in the mid-1960s.  He had an early success with “Loves of a Blonde,” which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1967. His satire “The Fireman’s Ball” was banned in Czechoslovakia in 1968 after the Soviets invaded and crushed any liberal strides the country had made. Forman immigrated to the United States and became a U.S. citizen in 1975. That same year, he directed “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” which won five Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Picture. Forman would win another directing Oscar for 1984’s “Amadeus” and be nominated again for 1996’s “The People vs. Larry Flynt.” His other notable films include “Hair,” “Ragtime” and “Man on the Moon.” He also wrote and acted in several of his movies. Forman is survived by his four children."
BUSINESS,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture is pushing forward with a proposed rule that would forego line-speed limits in hog processing plants, a move that could endanger the well-being of workers and consumers, activists say. The proposal is part of the USDA’s effort to “modernize” the swine industry, the organization announced earlier this month. These plants, which already work at feverish speeds of up to 1,106 hogs per hour, would likely use the change as an opportunity to further increase the pace of production.  In addition to increasing line speeds, the proposal would allow employees to take over some of the oversight duties that USDA inspectors currently handle on the kill lines. The way it works now, USDA inspectors are expected to examine every animal that comes down the line, and are tasked with identifying diseased hogs and visible fecal matter. Under the proposed rule, plant employees would take over that job before the carcasses reach federal inspectors. The move could potentially help the hog industry’s bottom line. But faster speeds could also put consumers at risk, since inspectors may not be able to examine each carcass adequately for diseases and other issues. Increasing the rate of speed lines could present more risks for plant workers who already face a slew of hazards at the industry’s current pace, including amputations and musculoskeletal injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome.  But the USDA maintains that it’s not its responsibility to ensure worker safety ― that’s up to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said Carmen Rottenberg, deputy administrator at the Food Safety and Inspection Service at USDA. The proposal is “a gift to the industry,” said Tony Corbo, senior lobbyist with Washington-based advocacy group Food & Water Watch. “The industry has been pushing to deregulate inspection all the way back to the Reagan administration.” Corbo added that while the proposed rule fits in with the Trump administration’s “deregulatory talk,” the concept actually precedes the current presidency.  During the Obama administration, the USDA approved a similar plan for poultry plants in 2014. But after getting bombarded with pushback from activists and the media, the government organization decided to prohibit plants from ramping up the speeds on slaughter lines.  Rottenberg told HuffPost that the revised protocol would increase efficiency and free up USDA inspectors to perform other tasks around the hog plants. The organization pointed to the “success” of a pilot program that started in the late 1990s, which allowed five hog plants to operate as their own designated speeds. “For large-volume establishments, this new swine inspection system does make better use of the agency’s resources while also removing unnecessary regulatory obstacles to industry,” said Rottenberg.  But a 2013 report from the Office of the Inspector General harshly criticized the USDA for its lack of oversight of pork slaughterhouses in general, and took issue with the five plants involved in the pilot program in particular. The report concluded that between 2008 and 2011, three of the 10 plants with the most citations for food safety and animal welfare violations were part of the USDA pilot program. Those plants, which had 50 percent more citations than the plant with next highest number, continue to run at the same speeds.  Workers’ advocates also say that faster line speeds will make an already dangerous job even more dangerous. Serious injuries ― those that require work restrictions or days off from work ― are more than three times higher in meat packing than other U.S. industries, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. While protecting workers is not within the USDA’s regulatory purview, activists say that workers at slaughterhouses – who are often refugees and immigrants that are reluctant to speak up about hazardous conditions ― rely on USDA’s rules to keep them safe. “Food safety regulations have acted as a de facto throttle on line speeds, and has consequently protected workers,” said Nicole Civita, a lawyer, professor, food ethicist and director of the Food Recovery Project. Before moving forward with the proposed rule, the USDA will accept comments from the public for 60 days, through mid-March. Earlier this week, the USDA rejected a petition from the National Chicken Council requesting that poultry processing plants be allowed to do away with line speed maximums.  Activists say there’s no difference between the poultry and hog industries: If the USDA rejected the idea of increasing line speed for chickens, they should also reject it for hogs for the same reasons.  “Do people really want to eat meat that has not been properly processed? What if they find toenails in their hot dogs, or if hogs were diseased and haven’t been caught because the lines are moving so fast?” Corbo said. “Operating at these excessive line speeds without having adequate inspection will put more product into commerce [and] on people’s tables that are unsafe and not wholesome to eat.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,"UPDATE: Aug. 26 ― The Guggenheim will not be showing the three animal-related works that have sparked protests, the museum announced Monday.  PREVIOUSLY: New York City’s Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, commonly called The Guggenheim, is facing accusations of animal cruelty over an upcoming show that includes an arena where live reptiles and insects will “devour each other” and a video of dogs strapped to treadmills. Those exhibits are slated to be part of the museum’s October show, “Art and China After 1989: Theater of the World.” The exhibit features more than 150 pieces of art by more than 70 artists, the vast majority of which are not sparking any backlash. However, three pieces in particular are attracting criticism from animal welfare activists. The piece that’s gotten the most negative press is “Dogs That Cannot Touch Each Other,” by controversial artist duo Sun Yuan and Peng Yu. When they first staged the piece in 2003, four pairs of pit bull-type dogs were brought to the Today Museum in Beijing and strapped onto non-motorized treadmills at close proximity, facing each other — similar to techniques sometimes used to train fighting dogs. A post shared by Sophie Gamand (@sophiegamand) on Sep 21, 2017 at 11:37am PDT The Guggenheim’s exhibit will not involve live dogs in the flesh — it’s a video of the 2003 performance, the museum emphasized in a statement. The Guggenheim described the piece as “an intentionally challenging and provocative artwork that seeks to examine and critique systems of power and control.” Peng has previously defended the piece, saying that the dogs were not being abused because they are “naturally pugnacious” — an oft-repeated stereotype about pit bulls. The New York Times article on the exhibit, however, describes the dogs tethered to the treadmills as being frustrated, getting “wearier and wearier, their muscles more and more prominent, and their mouths increasingly salivate.” Animal welfare activists say that the video itself is unethical because of how it was created, and the way it depicts pit bulls. “[The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals] opposes the use of animals in art if such practices produce pain, injury or distress to the animals,” said ASPCA president Matt Bershadker in a statement to Pix 11. “The video perpetuates the false stereotype that pit bulls are only purposeful as vicious dog fighting instruments, not as what they are at their core: affectionate and loyal animals who crave our attention and deserve safe and loving homes.” Two other exhibits under fire include a video featuring mating pigs covered in ink, and the show’s titular piece ― an installation involving live reptiles and insects, some of which will die during the show. The Guggenheim describes “Theater of the World” by artist Huang Yong Ping as “a caged arena shaped like a mythological tortoise, hundreds of live reptiles and insects devour each other over the course of the show.”  A Guggenheim spokeswoman told HuffPost that one section of the installation will house leopard geckos, Italian wall lizards, millipedes, crickets, cockroaches, grasshoppers, and two types of beetles. A second will contain corn snakes and sulcata tortoises. “The Museum staff worked closely with the artist as well as with an entomologist and reptile and insect care experts,” she said in an email. “The insects were sourced in consultation with local experts; all are non-venomous. The reptiles have been selected and are cared for by trained professionals, including regular observation by a veterinarian.” She added that lighting will be appropriate to help the animals acclimate to their environment, and that their feeding is managed by “trained experts.” It was not immediately clear what the museum’s initial press release meant when it said the reptiles and insects would “devour each other.” Versions of the piece have been shown all over the world, and it has sparked controversy multiple times, including when the Vancouver Art Gallery removed the installation in 2007 after Huang refused to let them make some alterations at the recommendation of a veterinarian. Huang argued in a 2015 interview that the installation isn’t cruel, saying it’s no different from pet stores selling bugs as food for other animals: I was trying to present a metaphor through these creatures, not to emphasize their cruelty. I was presenting a case in which the bugs represented different kinds of people who supposedly cannot exist together, and raising the question—what would it be like if they coexisted? Hence the metaphoric title Theater of the World. I believe that this artwork is about raising such meaningful questions, not illustrating so-called cruelty. An online petition calling for the removal of the exhibits involving animals had garnered more than 160,000 signatures as of Saturday afternoon. This article has been updated with comments from a Guggenheim spokeswoman."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Before there was Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith ― just try and imagine, OK? ― the “Fresh Prince of Bel Air” star was married to his now ex-wife, Sheree Fletcher, with whom he shares a son. Pinkett Smith recently revealed that she began dating the actor before he and Fletcher officially divorced, which has been a sore spot in the family ever since. All these years later, the “Girls Trip” actress is now sitting down with Fletcher for her new web series “Red Table Talk” to have a candid conversation about the challenges of marriage and motherhood they overcame together.  Pinkett Smith said that in hindsight, “because I did not understand marriage, I did not understand divorce ... I probably should have fell back.” “You think?” Fletcher fired back with a smile. Will Smith and Fletcher’s son, Trey Smith, grew up alongside Pinkett Smith’s kids, Jaden Smith and Willow Smith ― the children are often pictured at events all together. But Fletcher admitted that initially, she wasn’t on board with the idea of one big, happy family. The former reality TV star said that one of the most difficult moments came when Trey Smith met Pinkett Smith for the first time. “So Trey comes home and I said, ‘How did you like Miss Jada?’ He said, ‘I really liked her, mommy,’” Fletcher recalled. Pinkett Smith immediately began to cry, exclaiming, “Oh my God,” before Fletcher reached out her hand and thanked her “for loving my baby.” After Smith and Fletcher’s divorce was finalized in 1995, the two women eventually overcame their differences and learned to co-parent. Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith have now been married for 20 years, while Fletcher wed football player Terrell Fletcher in 2007. Trey Smith is now a working DJ who performs under the name DJ AcE. “I would say [Fletcher] has been one of the main people in my life that has forced me to expand in a way that was beyond anything I imagined, and I’m so grateful,” Pinkett Smith told her mother, Adrienne Banfield-Jones, and daughter, Willow Smith, after the sit-down. “It has been a hell of a journey.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,"By Michele Kumi Baer Ask any New Yorker what makes this city a great place to live, and you will get an earful about the rich cultural life. From world-famous productions on proscenium stages to longstanding drumming circles in City parks, New York is home to an unparalleled variety of artistic activities that give New Yorkers a sense of belonging amid a dense, impersonal urban enclave; provide space for people to engage in civic action; and celebrate the beauty and ingenuity that exists within all of us.  A city like ours doesn’t happen overnight. It is the result of centuries of migrations, policies, protests, and practices of people that value culture, heritage, and expression.  Over the next year, we have the opportunity to continue this legacy and sustain New York as a global cultural capital. As the City completes its cultural plan, a blueprint for cultural policy in the years to come, the federal government renews efforts to cut funding for the arts and basic social services.  We need a cultural plan that advances artistic practices and cultural institutions that serve New Yorkers who will be the most affected by proposed federal cuts, or we risk losing the diversity that makes New York City a cultural hub.  The concept of creative “placemaking” – that arts and culture help develop a place and its community – is not a new idea. At The New York Community Trust, we recently brought some of our donors together to learn about this phenomenon. Since 2010, an organized national creative placemaking field has emerged, shepherded by the team at ArtPlace America. Increased attention to this work has sparked more investments at the nexus of arts and community development. We’ve seen it through philanthropic partnerships like ArtPlace, a funding collaborative that positions culture as a core sector for community planning and development, and newer endeavors like Upstart Co-Lab, which connects artist-innovators doing place-based work with impact investors who want to support it.  Policymakers also have taken note. In recent years, more municipalities have enacted cultural policy initiatives aimed at harnessing the power of the arts to increase wellness and social cohesion in their cities. A recent study funded by The Trust identified several neighborhoods for strategic investment, including so-called “civic clusters,” lower-income neighborhoods with a density of cultural assets that exceeds that of other neighborhoods with similar economics (e.g., Bedford-Stuyvesant, Flushing, Hunts Point), and lower-income neighborhoods that have fewer cultural assets than their peers (e.g., Corona, East New York, South Jamaica). Many lower-income neighborhoods house community development corporations (CDCs), which have been creatively supporting their communities since the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation became the nation’s first CDC in 1967.  Recently the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation (GJDC) has been working with the City Department of Cultural Affairs’ Building Community Capacity (BCC) initiative (also funded by The Trust) to advance equitable development in Downtown Jamaica that is inclusive of culture, and it is exploring the development of a new artist housing development in the neighborhood. CDCs are well-positioned to help ensure local artists and cultural groups have a say in the future of their neighborhoods.  The City has put forward a proposal for its cultural plan (due out in July) to provide baselined funding for the Building Community Capacity initiative in the City’s budget, and therefore remove reliance on a now at-risk federal Community Development Block Grant program for this effort to survive.  New York is a dynamic, creative place because of the plurality of cultural resources it houses in every borough. Artists are the problem solvers, truth tellers, community builders, and spiritual guides of our society. Our cultural traditions give us a sense of belonging, help us connect to our neighbors, and allow us to explore human ingenuity. Social, spiritual, economic, and health benefits are associated with culture, and recent research has the data to prove it.  The challenge for philanthropy and the City’s cultural plan is to ensure that our arts investments keep New York a creative place for all of us. Michele Kumi Baer is a program associate for The Trust’s grantmaking to promote thriving communities."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Comedian Bill Cosby was found guilty on Thursday in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, but the verdict’s also being felt in Hollywood. Many celebrities tweeted after the news broke to express their belief that justice was served. Cosby is guilty. I’m sorry if you loved a lie. His victims can now exhale. Thank you judge and jury. Thank you society for waking up. ACCOUNTABILITY. This is the only way things will change. https://t.co/BzCBX0Zdh7 Just because you're rich and powerful doesn't mean another person’s body is automatically available for sex. Consent must be given.#BillCosby Finally some justice for Bill Cosby’s victims. May they find a little #peace today. #GUILTY More importantly, I haven't forgotten about the many women you assaulted and silenced with your power. Good riddance!!! https://t.co/PY4Dl0t1YS In our culture women are speaking out more & more, but the Cosby trial reminds us that male advocacy is still vital. @hannibalburess spoke truth to the disgrace of Cosby’s behavior & that perspective mattered. In a fitting end to Sexual Assault Awareness month, Bill Cosby was found guilty today. Thinking of all the women he traumatized over the past 50 years. As a survivor myself, I know that pain never fully goes away. But I hope that his victims finally feel some semblance of peace. I wonder how long it’s going to take Trump to announce he’s going to pardon Bill Cosby. #BillCosby guilty & facing spending the rest of his natural life behind bars- that is IF convictions can withstand certain appeal based on trail judge’s allowance of five additional alleged victims testimony to buttress the complaining witness. Still, Patricia Arquette couldn’t help but point out an inconvenient truth. The state of America is this- Even with dozens of accusers we were all afraid Bill Cosby would walk. Need help?

ARTS & CULTURE," Modern Western education traditionally emphasizes two skills: the ability to process text and numbers. The importance of images, however, is often overlooked. While mainstream public schooling treats pictorial information as peripheral, a quick glimpse at the world around us can contradict this strategy. From television screens to billboards to magazine ads, images are everywhere, shaping and imprinting the minds of impressionable children and adults alike. To be illiterate in the realm of images leaves one powerless to criticize and create in a predominately image-driven culture.  The Guggenheim Museum in New York City has long been working to give children the opportunity to attain what they call ""visual literacy,"" a working understanding of what images are and how they work. Now in its 44th year, Learning Through Art is an educational program that provides elementary schoolers throughout New York public schools with the chance to spend 90 minutes a week focusing on art: looking at it, reflecting on it and, of course, making it.


 Student artwork. Third grade, PS 88, Queens, 2015, © 2015 Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York  In the 1970s, New York found itself in a fiscal crisis, on the verge of bankruptcy. As explained by Susan J. Bodilly and Catherine H. Augustine in Revitalizing Arts Education Through Community-Wide Coordination: ""The arts and arts teachers became easy targets for budget cutting. As an example, in 1975-1976, after a decade of crisis and constant budget cuts, the New York City public schools laid of 15,000 teachers, almost 25 percent of the total number. Teachers in subjects considered 'less central' were the first to go. According to the the Center for Arts Education, 'By 1991, the last year for which systematic arts data was collected by the Board of Education, two-thirds of the schools had no licensed art or music teachers.' Schools were no longer allowed to hire arts teachers, and arts teachers who remained were transferred to other positions."" In response to the massive cuts in arts funding in schools across New York, Natalie K. Lieberman, a member of the Guggenheim's development department, launched a program initially called Learning to Read Through the Arts. The initiative, which began as an independent program housed within the Guggenheim, provided arts education to public elementary school children across all five boroughs of New York. It continued through the mid-1990s with substantial contributions from Lieberman, until she passed away, and the museum absorbed the program.  The name soon changed to Learning Through Art (LTA), more accurately capturing the broad aims of a curriculum that extended well beyond reading. It's continued this way ever since. Each year, for 20 weeks, a teaching artist collaborates with a classroom instructor on an artistic curriculum that incorporates both themes from a central syllabus of coursework and the artworks currently on view at the Guggenheim. The syllabus includes hands-on art projects, discussions based on historical and contemporary artworks, as well as a final art project -- all of which revolve around a single theme, or ""essential question."" ""Every residency has an essential question that connects all the projects you do throughout the year together,"" teaching artist Molly O'Brien reiterated to The Huffington Post. And the culminating works don't just go on view in the teachers' lounge; they get their very own wing at the Guggenheim, on view alongside works by artists like On Kawara and Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian.
 Student Artwork. Third grade, PS 144, Queens, 2015 Photo: Kris McKay © 2015 Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York  This year, O'Brien teamed up with fourth-grade teacher Deborah Sachs at PS 86 in the Bronx, who has been participating in LTA for 13 years. Their ""essential question"" was inspired not by a particular piece at the Guggenheim but by the structure of the museum itself -- the iconic, spiraling edifice designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1959.  ""Our question was, 'How does where we are affect how we move?'"" O'Brien explained. ""We looked at the designs of spaces and environments and how we move through them. The students designed models of what their ideal schools and classrooms would look like. We talked a lot about Frank Lloyd Wright's perspective on architecture. Surprisingly, these third graders can talk a lot about organic architecture."" These questions, challenging to say the least, would likely intimidate an undergraduate art student, let alone an elementary schooler. But, as O'Brien put it, ""the kids rise to the challenge every time."" For example, she taught a second classroom this year, aside from Sachs' group, with a curriculum that revolves around the query, ""How can we time visible?"" To answer it, the class discussed the different ways time is experienced, witnessed and documented, both in life and in art. She described it as ""pretty conceptual.""
 Student artwork. Sixth grade, PS 86, Bronx, 2015 © 2015 Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York  The students and teachers also engage in a daily inquiry, focused on one specific work of art, frequently one found in the Guggenheim's collection. Using open-ended questions, the teachers facilitate powerful discussions that can last over 30 minutes on a single work of art. ""Depending on the background of the students, this idea of asking them a question that doesn't have an answer is a really foreign concept to them,"" O'Brien said. ""By the end you realize those conversations have so much more power and momentum and the potential to be really deep. They often go on for way longer than I'd expected, which is pretty impressive for nine and ten year olds."" The discussions also allow students to communicate in different ways, often with images of their own, a practice beneficial to those who may not have confidence talking in front of a group to express themselves. ""It gave the students more of a choice in how they were learning or how they were participating,"" said O'Brien. ""It's amazing for me to see often in the final weeks that students may not have been as vocal are volunteering to share their artwork."" ""The students are making art, looking at art, and reflecting on the experience,"" explained Greer Kudon, senior education manager of LTA at the Guggenheim. ""Having students engage with the art, finding evidence for their statements, it all connects back to this idea of visual literacy."" Visual literacy is at the core of the program; the notion that navigating and understanding television, movies, ads and websites are necessarily skills in today's world. In order to be an engaged citizen and a creative force, kids shouldn't just be talking about books, they need to be talking about images. At the end of the program, the teachers and staff confer to select around four artworks from each classroom to show as part of ""A Year with Children 2015,"" an exhibition at the Guggenheim. ""What the teaching artists and the classroom teachers are looking for are works that exemplify the process that the students have gone through over the course of the year,"" Kudon expressed. ""It's not necessarily the best figurative image or the best landscape, they're looking for works that capture the experience that these students had. We also, from where I stand, are looking for gender equality. Obviously we want them to be aesthetically pleasing, but that's very subjective.""
 Fifth grade, PS 9, Brooklyn, 2015 © 2015 Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York  The opportunity to be shown in the Guggenheim, one of the leading modern and contemporary art galleries in the world, is one most artists spend their lives working towards. The magnitude of the experience is not lost on the kids. ""Their art is in a wing just like Kandinsky's art is in a wing, or Chagall's,"" Sachs said. ""It's open like any other exhibit is open to the public. You will see foreigners walking through and it's unbelievable! I always joke with the kids and say 'Jean-Francois will be visiting from France, and he will see your work as an example of New York art!' What they gain from the experience -- it's enriching them in a way that, honestly, we can't do in the classroom."" Aside from the memories and pride associated with showing in a major museum, LTA provides children with tools that will assist them throughout their education, including literacy skills, problem solving, creativity and confidence. Two U.S. Department of Education grants have quantified some of the advancements actualized by the art program. The first, ""Teaching Literacy Through Art,"" conducted between 2004 and 2006, explored the correlation between reading skills and artistic learning. ""Across the board, it was proven there was improvement in literacy for students who went through the program,"" Kudon explained. Specifically, as detailed in the study, ""Treatment Group students were more talkative and used more complex language than did Control Group students."" The second study, conducted between 2007 and 2009, was titled ""The Art of Problem Solving,"" and examined children's problem solving and creative skills, breaking down this somewhat abstract concept into six more measurable components. The results showed that three out of the six targets showed improvement --flexibility, connections of ends to aims, resource recognition. (The other categories were imagining, experimentation and self-reflection.)  As summarized in the study: ""In plain language, the findings indicate that students who participate in LTA are more likely to plan, persist, be deliberate and thoughtful, approach difficulties with focus, and have greater knowledge of art materials. On the other hand, students who participate in LTA are no more likely to imagine beyond the task at hand or self critique, and they are less likely to try a number of materials."" Kudon hypothesized the satisfactory but not exceptional status of the results stems from the kinds of questions being asked in the particular study. ""I think the realization was that these are much harder skills to evaluate in terms of children's success.""
 Fourth grade, PS 8, Brooklyn, 2015 © 2015 Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York  Some stories, however, make the triumphant outcomes of LTA more than obvious. ""A few years ago when the earthquake occurred in Haiti, I had a child come to my class who had lost his house and his grandparents,"" Sachs explained. ""He was put into my class because he spoke French, as do I. He didn't speak a word -- nothing. I remember taking him to the Guggenheim and thinking, this is going to be interesting. As if he wasn't already shellshocked enough from the country, the city, the school, the language. Right away, he was immersed in this unbelievable artistic experience. Suddenly he was the star of the class, the nicest kid, everyone loved him. He wasn't the most amazing artist in the world, but he loved it all the same."" This year, the Guggenheim is conducting a small grassroots evaluation of the program's effect on children by following six students at four of the participating schools, two performing under grade level, two at grade level, and two above grade level. Kudon explained: ""We've done a lot of interviews with these students, asking them about their experience with LTA, what subjects they like best in school, if they ever think about LTA in their other subjects."" They also get feedback from the classroom teacher, the teaching artist and the parents of each child. The results of this evaluation will not be available until the end of the program. For what it's worth -- and that's a lot -- the kids love it. ""LTA brings my mind to life, and we are very fortunate to work with The Guggenheim,"" fourth grader Nashary Altamar wrote about her experience. ""LTA is a way to learn how to do art and learn how people made art,"" added classmate Christopher Macato. And from Sachs herself: ""It's an hour and a half of the day where kids' minds can wander. In a way, the program and the trips enrich the children's lives in ways the curriculum can't. It's truly a gift that's given to the children.""
 Fourth grade, PS 48, Staten Island, 2015 © 2015 Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York  Our daily lives are saturated with an overabundance of magazine spreads, commercials, printed ads, pop-ups, and countless other graphic signals and signs. ""It's a language of words and images which calls out to us wherever we go, whatever we read, wherever we are,"" John Berger said in his iconic 1972 television series ""Ways of Seeing.""  Learning Through Art offers up a new model of digesting this overabundance, a model that views understanding art and images not as subsidiary skills for the bourgeoning mind, but a crucial element of being an engaged and purposeful citizen. ""A Year With Children 2015"" runs from May 1 until June 17, 2015, at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City.

ARTS & CULTURE,"As 2018 approaches, there’s a lot to look forward to: the end of a hellish 2017, the Winter Olympics, “The Bachelor: Winter Games,” 2017 being over, midterm elections, and 2017 finally drawing to a close.  More than anything, though, we’re eagerly anticipating the flood of new 2018 books ― and the coming year’s literary crop looks bountiful. We can’t wait to lose ourselves in new fiction from Meg Wolitzer, Laura van den Berg and Leni Zumas, and to absorb thoughtful essays about culture, gender, race and identity from Zadie Smith, Morgan Jerkins and Marilynne Robinson. We’re also excited for the books that don’t appear on this list ― books we don’t even know about yet, but which will end up surprising us with their power and beauty.  Here are the 60 books we can’t wait to read in 2018: “The Nothing,” Hanif Kureishi (Faber & Faber) An elderly filmmaker becomes obsessed with the fear that his younger wife is having an affair with a friend, and plots to expose them. Kureishi’s latest novel is a slim and focused tale of sex, vengeance and mortality. “The Immortalists,” Chloe Benjamin (Putnam) If you’re a sucker for fantasy-tinged family sagas, “The Immortalists” should have you excited. In the summer of 1968, four young siblings visit a fortune-teller who tells them the day they’ll die ― a prediction that shapes the rest of their lives. “The Afterlives,” Thomas Pierce (Riverhead) There’s a cottage industry of Christian memoirs about heaven written by people who were revived after technically dying. Pierce’s novel explores the emotional fallout of the reverse scenario: A young man suffers a sudden heart attack, is resuscitated, and realizes, to his dismay, that he didn’t glimpse an afterlife.   “Everything Here Is Beautiful,” Mira T. Lee (Pamela Dorman) Lee’s debut novel tells the story of two sisters ― the older one responsible and practical, the younger one impulsive and plagued by mental illness ― navigating a lonely adulthood after their mother dies. The narrative carries echoes of ”Sense and Sensibility,” but offers a wholly original exploration of sisterly bonds. “Red Clocks,” Leni Zumas (Little, Brown) Set in an America where embryos have been granted personhood rights and abortion has been outlawed, this chilling dystopia follows a handful of women whose lives are tightly circumscribed by these laws. Zumas’s incandescent prose promises to make ”Red Clocks” a particular treat. “Brass,” Xhenet Aliu (Random House) Aliu’s first novel arrives on a wave of glowing blurbs from some of our favorite writers of the past few years ― Celeste Ng, Cristina Henriquez, Kaitlyn Greenidge, and Laura van den Berg. In mordant, biting prose, she interweaves the stories of a mother and a daughter living in a fading Connecticut town they both hopelessly long to escape from. “The Sky Is Yours,” Chandler Klang Smith (Hogarth) Readers who love ambitious literary genre fiction should be on the lookout for Smith’s first novel, a vibrantly uncanny dystopia set on an island metropolis, in the shadow of dragons that swoop overhead, where income inequality and mass incarceration have spun out of control. “Peach,” Emma Glass (Bloomsbury USA) Even as the world confronts report after report of famous men who are sexual predators, we rarely confront the horrific pain that can result from sexual violence. In “Peach,” a stream-of-consciousness narrative about a girl reeling in the aftermath of a brutal rape, Glass confronts us with the bodily and psychological trauma left behind. “This Will Be My Undoing: Living at the Intersection of Black, Female, and Feminist in (White) America,” Morgan Jerkins (Harper Perennial) Jerkins’s buzzy essay collection revolves around identity, and what it has meant for her to live as a black woman in America. In essays about white cheerleaders, children’s books, traveling in Russia, going to therapy and much more, she unpacks her discovery of her own identity, and her struggle with the white, patriarchal American culture that surrounds her. “Heart Berries,” Terese Marie Mailhot (Counterpoint) “Heart Berries” is praised in press copy as a “poetic memoir.” But poetic is an oft-used descriptor of lovely writing, and this book seems to be something more striking than the word signifies: a memoir and a poem, a haunting and dazzlingly written narrative of Mailhot’s growing up on a reservation in the Pacific Northwest. “Asymmetry,” Lisa Halliday (Simon & Schuster) A Whiting Award winner, ”Asymmetry” tells two unexpectedly overlapping stories ― first, that of a love affair between a young woman and an aging, famous author; then the story of an Iraqi-American man who is targeted by immigration enforcement as he travels out of the country.   “The Friend,” Sigrid Nunez (Riverhead) In the acclaimed novelist’s latest book, two writers share a close, unconventional friendship; when one them dies suddenly, his widow asks the other to take in his Great Dane. As the narrator makes space in her apartment for the huge dog, she also sinks into her own overwhelming grief. “Feel Free,” Zadie Smith (Penguin Press) If you aren’t already looking forward to this new book of essays from the irreplaceable Smith, now’s the time to get jazzed. If there’s anything more absorbing to read than her novels, it might just be her essays, which are reflective, erudite yet inviting, and which always cut to the quick of her chosen subject.  “An American Marriage,” Tayari Jones (Algonquin) In Jones’s heart-wrenching new novel, a young and ambitious black couple find their lives derailed when the husband is arrested, convicted and sentenced to 12 years for a crime he didn’t commit. “An American Marriage” poses profound questions about what we owe each other, and what injustices we allow to persist. “I Am, I Am, I Am: Seventeen Brushes With Death,” Maggie O’Farrell (Knopf) A story of life, told in moments when death was nearest, is the award-winning novelist’s latest. O’Farrell’s memoir is told in highly charged vignettes ― distinct memories of near-death experiences. “The Lost Girls of Camp Forevermore,” Kim Fu (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt) Five girls on the precipice of adolescence go on a kayaking trip, but find themselves left alone in the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest. Fu’s novel starts here, at Camp Forevermore, but follows the lives of these girls well into adulthood ― and shows how deeply marked they are by that fateful time at camp. “Sadness Is a White Bird,” Moriel Rothman-Zecher (Atria) In his novel, Rothman-Zecher, once a conscientious objector who refused to serve in the Israeli Defense Forces, explores the fraught politics of the region through the eyes of a young Israeli man and two Palestinian siblings he befriends. “Freshwater,” Akwaeke Emezi (Grove) This debut novel follows Ada as she is born, grows up and leaves Nigeria for America to go to college. Always a troubled girl, it becomes clear that she has multiple personalities struggling for dominance within her, and she must grapple with external trauma as well as her own self-destructive urges. “White Houses,” Amy Bloom (Random House) In this historical novel, Bloom dramatizes the love affair between Eleanor Roosevelt and journalist Lorena Hickok. Though Roosevelt is the more familiar woman, Hickok is the narrator and central figure in Bloom’s fictionalization of their complicated romance. “What Are We Doing Here?,” Marilynne Robinson (Farrar, Straus & Giroux) The title of Robinson’s latest book of essays ― many of which were given as lectures over the past few years ― should be read with a rueful sigh. In her measured but strongly argued pieces, she takes on American self-mythologizing, the role of faith and values in our history and the roots of our divided politics.  “Census,” Jesse Ball (Ecco) Inspired by his own late brother, Ball’s atmospheric novel follows a widower who learns he’s dying and will soon leave his beloved son, who has Down syndrome, alone in the world. Desperate to make the most of their final days together, he takes a job traveling the country as a census taker. “Girls Burn Brighter,” Shobha Rao (Flatiron) The first novel from an award-winning short fiction writer, ”Girls Burn Brighter” tells the story of two young girls growing up in a small Indian village. They form a fast friendship, only to be torn apart. Rao’s novel should be a treat for Ferrante fans, exploring the bonds of friendship and how female ambition beats against the strictures of poverty and patriarchal societies. “Awayland,” Ramona Ausubel (Riverhead) Ausubel, known for her darkly whimsical fiction, is publishing her second short story collection. It will feature 11 stories, divided into four subsections: “Bay of Hungers,” “The Cape of Persistent Hope,” “The Lonesome Flats,” and “The Dream Isles.” “Rainbirds,” Clarissa Goenawan (Soho Press) Goenawan’s debut novel, a genre-bending tale of a young man who moves to a small town to put his sister’s affairs in order after she’s brutally murdered, has already garnered international praise for elegantly combining a suspenseful mystery with an eloquent meditation on love and loss.  “Gun Love,” Jennifer Clement (Hogarth) Clement turns her hypnotic pen to the story of America’s love affair with guns ― specifically, a nine-year-old girl and her mother, who live in a trailer park in central Florida. Their impoverished but happy life is disrupted by the mother’s romance with a gun-loving rascal. “The Sparsholt Affair,” Alan Hollinghurst (Knopf) The latest novel from Hollinghurst, whom New Yorker critic James Wood once described as “one of the few contemporary writers who deserve” to be praised for “writing beautifully,” is a multigenerational saga that revolves around a man named David Sparsholt who arrives at Oxford in the midst of World War II. “The Life to Come,” Michelle de Kretser (Catapult) The acclaimed Australian writer’s fifth novel spans continents ― set in Australia, France and her native Sri Lanka ― and weaves together disparate narratives that raise uncomfortable questions about Australian society, self-satisfied liberalism and modern life. “The Merry Spinster: Tales of Everyday Horror,” Mallory Ortberg (Holt) Toasties, assemble! The cofounder of the beloved, if short-lived, website The Toast has transformed one of the site’s literary humor columns, “Children’s Stories Made Horrific,” into a book of twisted tales inspired by classic fairy tales. We could not be more excited. “Men and Apparitions,” Lynne Tillman (Soft Skull) Tillman’s sixth novel ― her first in over a decade ― centers on an eccentric man with academic obsessions. She traces his mental perambulations as he immerses himself in family photographs and stories, studies modern masculinity and loses himself in his own circling thoughts and emotions. “The Gunners,” Rebecca Kauffman (Counterpoint) The Gunners are a tightknit group of neighborhood playmates ― until they come of age, and one friend stops associating with them. Years later, that long-estranged friend dies by suicide, and the remaining five gather again to untangle what went wrong, what secrets she was holding onto and what secrets are in their own pasts. “Stray City,” Chelsea Johnson (Custom House) Set in Portland in the late 1990s and the late 2000s, ”Stray City” follows a young woman who finds acceptance in the city’s lesbian community, far from her religious upbringing, only to end up having a baby after a fling with a man. Johnson’s debut promises to be an engaging, immersive saga of family, chosen and otherwise. “The Italian Teacher,” Tom Rachman (Viking) The author of ”The Imperfectionists” and ”The Rise and Fall of Great Powers” returns with a timely novel about a great artist whose failings as a father and a husband shape his family’s lives ― especially that of his son, also an artist, who lives in his father’s shadow. “The Chandelier,” Clarice Lispector, translated by Benjamin Moser and Magdalena Edwards (New Directions) Lispector, a Brazilian writer, died in 1977, but she’s enraptured a burgeoning American audience in recent years. A brilliantly artful novel of the interior life of a female sculptor, ”The Chandelier” will be released in English for the first time in March. “The Female Persuasion,” Meg Wolitzer (Riverhead) The author of “The Interestings” once again takes on the optimistic pangs of new adulthood and female ambition in a novel about a college freshman who is shocked and thrilled to be taken under the wing of a feminist leader.   “The Recovering: Intoxication and Its Aftermath,” Leslie Jamison (Little, Brown) Jamison rocketed to fame with, of all things, the publication of an essay collection, “The Empathy Exams.” Her much-anticipated new book is a hefty full-length nonfiction work, a memoir and cultural history of addiction and recovery. “See What Can Be Done,” Lorrie Moore (Knopf) Best loved for her funny, sharp short stories, Moore will release a nonfiction collection of her criticism and essays this spring.  “Macbeth,” Jo Nesbø (Hogarth) “Macbeth” might have been Shakespeare’s shortest tragedy, but there’s nothing short about Norwegian musician and crime novelist Joe Nesbø’s hefty modern adaptation. The latest in Hogarth’s Shakespeare series situates Macbeth as a beleaguered police inspector caught amid a violent drug war. “Sharp: The Women Who Made an Art of Having an Opinion,” Michelle Dean (Grove) Dean offers a new, women-centric perspective on 20th century American public thought in this history of 10 women whose writing influenced the culture profoundly, including Pauline Kael, Nora Ephron, Joan Didion, and Janet Malcolm. “And Now We Have Everything: On Motherhood Before I Was Ready” by Meaghan O’Connell (Little, Brown) Mothers and non-mothers alike have been raving about O’Connell’s book, which grew from her experience keeping an accidental pregnancy in her early 20s and navigating the rigid expectations and bewildering challenges of motherhood. “Heads of the Colored People,” Nafissa Thompson-Spires (Atria) A debut collection of interrelated stories, “Heads of the Colored People” explores the lives of black ― especially middle-class ― people, with biting, vivid prose. Thompson-Spires plumbs the depths of black trauma, but also works in a comic mode, satirizing the way Americans think and talk about race, gender, class and more. “You All Grow Up and Leave Me,” Piper Weiss (William Morrow) The true-crime memoir genre is thriving, and Weiss’ offering looks particularly intriguing: She was 14 years old when her tennis coach, Gary Wilensky, tried to kidnap a young student, failed and then took his own life. In this book, Weiss looks back on her own youthful time with Wilensky, and reexamines the case itself. “You Think It, I’ll Say It,” Curtis Sittenfeld (Random House) Sittenfeld, best known for her novels, which include ”Prep” and ”Eligible,” will publish her debut short fiction collection ― ten stories that promise to make good use of her wit and ability to draw deeply relatable characters interacting in deeply human ways. “A Lucky Man,” Jamel Brinkley (Graywolf) Brinkley’s debut collection, which explores young black men and boys coming of age and finding their places in the world, arrives loaded up with glowing blurbs from literary stars like Daniel Alarcón, Charles Baxter, Garth Greenwell, Paul Yoon and Laila Lalami. “The Pisces,” Melissa Broder (Hogarth) Broder is best known for her Twitter account and the essay collection that sprang from it, ”So Sad Today.” ”The Pisces,” her first novel, blends the fantastical with the all-too-relatable in the story of Lucy, a heartbroken, anxiety-ridden Ph.D. student who falls in love with a merman. “Not That Bad: Dispatches from Rape Culture,” edited by Roxane Gay (Harper Perennial) The only unfortunate thing about this new collection on rape culture, edited by Roxane Gay and featuring work from Gabrielle Union, Ally Sheedy, Lyz Lenz, and more, is that it’s not out until May. We’ve never needed a book like this more than we do at this cultural moment. “Motherhood,” Sheila Heti (Henry Holt) The author of the acclaimed novel-from-life “How Should a Person Be?,” Heti turns her attention away from the 20-something indulgences of friendship, casual sex, and single-minded artistry to the 30-something anxiety of whether, and when, to have kids.   “That Kind of Mother,” Rumaan Alam (Ecco) A white woman adopts a black infant after his mother, her own son’s beloved nanny, dies in childbirth. From this heartbreaking premise, Alam plumbs still more heartbreaking questions about the power and limitations of maternal love, and the implacable persistence of racial divides.  “The Ensemble,” Aja Gabel (Riverhead) A string quartet, and the four young friends that form it, pursue musical success and personal happiness in a coming-of-age novel about four people coming to grips with themselves, the lives they want and their relationships with each other. “Florida,” Lauren Groff (Riverhead) Florida is a state a lot of people have strong feelings about ― including, as it turns out, the author of ”Fates and Furies.” Her next book, a short story collection, centers on the state she calls home. “Sick: A Life of Lyme, Love, Illness, and Addiction,” Porochista Khakpour (Harper Perennial) Khakpour, a novelist and writer, suffered from a mysterious chronic illness for years before she got a diagnosis. Her memoir explores the exhausting, hope-sapping experience of navigating the health care system and searching for answers in the face of unremitting suffering. “Who Is Vera Kelly?,” Rosalie Knecht (Tin House) A classic spy novel with a modern, fully realized heroine, ”Who Is Vera Kelly?” follows the titular heroine from her turbulent youth to her time as a spy in Argentina during the Cold War. “What We Were Promised,” Lucy Tan (Little, Brown) A wealthy Chinese couple, both American-educated professionals, and their housekeeper struggle with their veiled dissatisfactions and existential crises in Tan’s debut novel. “The Third Hotel,” Laura van den Berg (Farrar, Strauss and Giroux) In this dream-like novel, a woman travels to Havana for a film festival. The trip was planned by her recently deceased husband, but when she arrives, she finds him there ― not looking very dead. The reality-defying narrative explores inescapably real questions about the human condition. “The Court Dancer,” Kyung-Sook Shin (Pegasus) The acclaimed South Korean writer’s next novel takes place in the Joseon Court and in Paris in the late 19th century, as a beautiful court dancer navigates palace intrigue, the Parisian intellectual milieu and personal heartbreak. “Eleanor, or, The Rejection of the Progress of Love,” Anna Moschovakis   (Coffee House Books) A woman loses her laptop, with all of her work inside. Her quest to recover her data shapes this complicated meta-novel, which untangles the creative process itself, in all of its contradictions, anxieties and hopes. “My Struggle: Book 6,” Karl Ove Knausgaard, translated by Don Bartlett   (Archipelago) If you’re a Knausgaard fan, mark your calendar: His next installment of the autobiographical series that vaulted him to international fame will be arrive on American shores in September. “Transcription,” Kate Atkinson (Transworld) A young woman joins the Secret Service during the war, then heads to the BBC ― but her past continues to follow her, in the latest from Atkinson, the author of ”Life After Life.” “Mr. Occam’s Razor,” Barbara Kingsolver (Harper) Kingsolver, the author of ”The Poisonwood Bible,” will publish a new novel this fall ― a cross-century saga about two families living in same New Jersey home, a one-time Utopian community, in very different eras. “Drifts,” Kate Zambreno (Harper Perennial) In an early 2017 interview, Zambreno, the author of “Green Girl,” said that her upcoming novel “deals a lot with friendships I have with other women writers, and about our conversations.” “All You Can Ever Know,” Nicole Chung (Catapult) The Catapult web editor and Toast alum has written, hauntingly, about her adoption and growing up in a white family before. Her long-awaited memoir promises to explore the subject more fully: her relationship with her adoptive family, her reconnection with her birth family, beginning her own family and how she’s worked to find a sense of belonging."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Not all superheroes wear capes. No, sometimes they come to the red carpet with branches sticking out their clothes.  Actor Vin Diesel committed and then some to his look for Monday night’s Hollywood premiere of “Avengers: Infinity War,” which unites characters across the Marvel cinematic universe. The “Guardians of the Galaxy” star reprised his role in the film as Groot, a famously monosyllabic tree-like alien. Dressed in all-white, Diesel sported a bomber jacket with twigs and branches affixed to his shoulders and sprouting from pockets. “It’s just the Groot coming out of me. It’s the Groot coming out of my jacket.” Diesel explained on the red carpet livestream. “I’m talking normal, and next thing you know, branches are growing out my chest. It’s crazy.” Diesel had already raised the bar for his red carpet looks. He came out in stilts wearing a T-shirt reading, “I am Groot” for the 2014 premiere of “Guardians of the Galaxy in London. The “Avengers: Infinity War” premiere was the largest gathering of Marvel superheroes and villains yet, according to Variety, with favorites that included Robert Downey Jr., Chadwick Boseman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Letitia Wright, Evangeline Lilly, Danai Gurira, Chris Pratt and Brie Larson.  The only major no-show was Captain America, aka Chris Evans, who’s performing in an off-Broadway production in New York City through the end of May.  Ahead of the screening, Downey made an emotional speech to castmates and fans who came out in droves for the premiere. “I want to talk about the past, present, and future,” Downey said, according to Entertainment Weekly. “The past for me was 30 years of dependency, depravity, and despair …. otherwise known as ‘An Actor Prepares!’” He added: “The present is this moment of glory for all of us. And the future? That is always uncertain. But looking at these friends behind me, it seems like things might brighten up after all.” Check out photos of the red carpet arrivals below. "
POLITICS,"Unprecedented levels of Islamophobia and heightened anti-Muslim rhetoric are so rampant that some Muslims are internalizing and accepting problematic stereotypes about themselves, according to a newly released report by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding.  The study found that Muslims are more likely than members of other faiths to agree with the sentiment that their community is “more prone to negative behavior than other people” — at 30 percent, compared with 13 percent of Jews and 12 percent of Catholics.  “One of the most important and surprising findings we got in this study was the degree to which Muslims have themselves internalized negative stereotypes about their own community. That does underscore the power of the media and political rhetoric that day in and day out paints a narrative of Muslims in a certain way, that Muslims themselves are not immune to adopting that idea,” said Dalia Mogahed, the ISPU’s director of research. The ISPU’s third annual American Muslim poll surveyed Muslims, Jews, Catholics, Protestants, white evangelicals and those who are nonaffiliated and compared attitudes across the groups. The report includes the ISPU’s first Islamophobia index, created in partnership with Georgetown’s Bridge Initiative, which measures different faith and nonfaith groups’ endorsement of anti-Muslim rhetoric. Internalizing racism involves “ingesting, often subconsciously, acceptance of the dominant society’s stereotype of one’s ethnic group,” according to a similar study conducted by the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research in 2016, “Exploring the Faith and Identity Crisis of American Muslim Youth.” The report corroborates the ISPU’s findings and documents the effects of Islamophobic rhetoric on the religious identity and perceptions of Muslim youths. The study found that 1 in 3 children surveyed wanted to tell others that they are Muslim and that 1 in 2 did not know whether they could be both Muslim and American.  Measuring internalized racism dates back to an infamous doll test conducted in 1947 to study the psychological effects of segregation on African-American children using black and white dolls. There have been few formal studies conducted since then, but the phenomenon has been well documented with other minority groups, including Latinos and Jews.  In fact, the new ISPU study found that Muslims and Jews were among the most likely — at 62 and 59 percent, respectively — to feel ashamed of violence committed by fellow members of their faith. Muslims’ internalization of negative stereotypes about their community can be traced to disproportionate negative coverage of Muslims in mainstream media, according to the ISPU, a nonprofit with offices in Dearborn, Michigan, and Washington, D.C.  A separate study conducted by the ISPU last month found that Muslims accused of plotting violence get seven times as much media attention and sentences four times as long as non-Muslim plotters. “It’s the combination of disproportionate media coverage and Muslims being much more focused on that kind of media coverage that explains the fact that Muslims themselves have internalized this very stereotype [of being prone to violence,]” Mogahed said.   The report also found that those who scored higher on the Islamophobia index were associated with greater support for President Donald Trump’s travel bans and increased surveillance of American mosques. Those groups were also more likely to accept targeting of civilians by military and violent groups.   On a scale from 0 to 100, with 0 the lowest level of prejudice, the report found that on average Muslims scored 17 on the Islamophobia index. By comparison, nonaffiliated respondents came in at 14; Jews and Catholics, 22; the general public, 24; Protestants, 31; and white evangelicals, 40. Founded in 2002, the ISPU, according to its website, conducts “objective, solution-seeking research that empowers American Muslims to develop their community and fully contribute to democracy and pluralism in the United States.” You can read the report in full here."

Helen Mirren in Peter Morgan's The Audience.  Photo: Joan Marcus
Take a revered, honored and accomplished actress (Dame Helen Mirren) and put her in a new play which reprises a character that won her a Best Actress Oscar in 2006 (as Elizabeth in ""The Queen"").  And not a mere ripoff.  Put it in the hands of Peter Morgan, who wrote ""The Queen,"" and whose theatrical bonafides include the astonishingly good Frost/Nixon; and director Stephen Daldry, of the stunning 1992 revival of An Inspector Calls and the international musical hit Billy Elliott.  There are enough fans of Mirren, and H.R.H., and Anglophile television, to attract S.R.O. audiences in the West End and on Broadway for as long as the star wishes to wear the crown.   ""Snapshots from The Queen,"" you might call it; in this case, it is more like a scrapbook. ""The Queen"" was set in one year of Elizabeth's reign, 1977, when she was dealing with the death of Princess Diana; Morgan's The Audience centers on sixty years-worth of Elizabeth's weekly audiences with her Prime Ministers (eight of whom are represented, starting with Winston Churchill and ending with the current David Cameron).  And there's the rub.  While most theatergoers are likely to be thrilled by The Audience--or more precisely, by Mirren's performance in The Audience--the concept dictates that we will be seeing pages from a scrapbook, without the dramatic heft that would make it a fine and/or important play.    Yes, there is great life for The Audience with Helen Mirren; but the script itself seems to be merely an element of the evening devised to support the star performance, in the same manner as Bob Crowley's sets and costumes and Ivana Primorac's hair and make-up.  Consider The Audience without the participation of Helen Mirren; while other stars are likely to try it--Kristin Scott Thomas is scheduled to do the play at London's Apollo next month--the appeal, here, is watching the star of ""The Queen"" playing The Queen live and in person.  Compare this to Frost/Nixon; while original stars Sheen and Langella were unforgettable in the roles, the play is more than strong enough to work with any number of actors.   The Audience gives us Ms. Mirren--and she is wonderful, thank you.  Her performance is more than enough to carry the day, and carry the play, to surefire success; while Elizabeth The Queen has her supporters and her detractors, Mirren's canny and well-rounded performance is sure to garner unanimous huzzahs.  The format is simple enough.  The Equerry--a combination butler/narrator--sets the scene; Geoffrey Beevers, one of the four actors imported with Mirren from London, has a droll and authoritative, raised-eyebrow manner which keeps the evening moving.  One is slightly surprised that he doesn't start the affair with one of those ""the action starts in 1936, before the age of cell phones, so please do toggle yours off"" speeches.  We then see Elizabeth with one of her more familiar prime ministers, John Major (a somewhat restrained and not-quite-comfortable Dylan Baker).  Major exits; Equerry makes a little speech; a team of ladies-in-waiting help Mirren through an impressive, onstage costume change that trims forty-three years; and we see the silhouette of her first prime minister, Winston Churchill.  Daldry gives Dakin Matthews a grand reveal, almost as if the silhouette of Alfred Hitchcock sprang to life.  (This was presumably effective in not-so-merry olde England, but at the press preview attended it was clear that a major portion of the patrons had no idea who this Mr. Churchill was.) That's the framework.  Between ministers, Mirren has costume and wig changes; some onstage, some off, and some rather remarkable--but there's something faulty when one of the major highlights of an entertainment are the costume changes.  (The most memorable element of the recent musical Cinderella, alas, was a costume change--which kept people talking but was indicative of the lackluster show itself.)  Morgan also gives us a running character he calls ""Young Elizabeth""--played at the performance attended by Sadie Sink, who alternates in the role with Elizabeth Teeter--who talks to one servant or other (and eventually her elder self) about how she would rather be able to go outside and play like all the other girls and boys.     The ""imaginary conversations from history"" nature of things is interrupted by the appearance of Harold Wilson, the Labour minister who served from 1964-70 and 1974-76.  Wilson has an awkward, bull-in-the-china-shop scene in the first act, and a highly amusing scene with the queen in Scotland, in which he describes the Queen's Balmoral Castle as a ""Rheinland Schloss.""  (He continually kids the Regent about her family's Germanic heritage.)  The play ends with a third Wilson encounter, this one moving and emotionally affecting.

I can't say whether the Wilson scenes are better than the rest of the play because of the actor, Richard McCabe; or whether Mr. McCabe, who won the Olivier Award for this performance (as did Mirren), sparks the play alive because of the writing.  In any event, Wilson is the only Minister up there created as more than a revue sketch.  In fact, Elizabeth and Wilson--as drawn by Morgan--could populate their own play, and it might well be as compelling as Frost/Nixon.   Mr. McCabe is a treat to watch.  So, to a lesser extent, is Michael Elwyn as Anthony Eden.  His participation is restricted to one, short scene; but it offers high stakes writing, centering on the Suez crisis of 1956, which tarnished the United Kingdom's place in the postwar world and caused Eden's resignation in disgrace.  The Suez scene, following Balmoral and followed by the Margaret Thatcher sequence, makes the second act far more involving than the first.  This despite the fact that Judith Ivey, who storms on like a Texan Thatcher, seems somewhat out of place (although this might be a question of the writing). So look to The Audience for an audience with Helen Mirren, dressed and coiffed as Elizabeth II.  An audience with Helen Mirren makes a fine night's entertainment, but not--in this case--a compelling dramatic event.

ENTERTAINMENT,"LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Deadpool might not consider himself a superhero, but its latest installment is off to a powerful start. The Marvel Comics film from 20th Century Fox debuted in North American with $125 million in 4,349 locations. That wasn’t enough to match the debut of its predecessor, 2016′s “Deadpool,” which had the biggest opening ever for an R-rated film with $132.4 million. The Ryan Reynolds-starrer bowed overseas with $176 million for a global weekend total of $301 million. Although it debuted under estimates, “Deadpool 2′s” launch was nothing to complain about. It still secured the second-best opening for an R-rated film, as well as the third-biggest debut of the year behind Marvel blockbusters “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Black Panther.” It also secured Fox its second-highest opening weekend in history. The sequel is still boasting a promising critical consensus, with an 84 percent Rotten Tomatoes rating and an A CinemaScore. “Deadpool 2′s” strong debut is a testament to Reynolds, according to Fox’s president of domestic distribution Chris Aronson. “I just can’t say enough about him,” Aronson said. “Not just the character, but promoting it. I feel great about this opening.” Its opening was enough to crush “Avengers: Infinity War’s” reign on the domestic box office. After securing the No. 1 spot for three weeks, the Disney and Marvel superhero tentpole dropped to second place. Its fourth weekend haul was still impressive, reeling in $29 million from 4,002 screens. “Infinity War’s” domestic tally currently sits at $595.4 million. “Infinity War” was followed by Paramount Pictures’ new release, “Book Club.” The romantic comedy ― starring Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen, and Mary Steenburgen ― came in slightly ahead of expectations, earning $12.3 million on 2,781 screens. The weekend’s other newcomer, Global Road Entertainment’s “Show Dogs,” landed in sixth place, only digging up $6 million from 3,212 locations. The family-friendly comedy garnered an A CinemaScore. Its Rotten Tomatoes critical score didn’t fare quite as well, averaging a 26 percent. Rounding out the top five are two film’s sophomore frames. Warner Bros.′ “Life of the Party” rallied in $7.5 million from 3,656 locations. Domestically, it has made $30.9 million. Universal’s “Breaking In” secured $6.5 million on 2,537 screens. In two weeks, it’s earned $28.8 million. In the specialty market, Focus Features’ “Pope Francis - A Man of His Word” opened with $480,000 on 346 screens for a per-screen average of $1,389. “RBG,” the documentary on Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is still holding strong. In its third weekend, it expanded to 375 locations for a three-day total of $1.28 million. That’s a per screen average of $3,413. Magnolia Pictures and Participant Media co-produced the film with Storyville Films and CNN Films. Thanks to a trio of superhero powerhouses, the domestic box office is up 6.3 percent from 2017, according to comScore. The weekend-to-date is up a staggering 62.9 percent, compared to 2017 when “Alien: Covenant” was the No. 1 film. “A crowded powerhouse of a mid-May weekend benefitted from a very diverse lineup of newcomers to appeal to almost every taste and demographic,” Paul Dergarabedian, box office analysis at comScore, said."

ARTS & CULTURE,"I was at a sleepover and up past midnight, itself a transgression, when my friend ― a whole year older than me and thus infinitely wiser ― pulled a book off the highest shelf: My Secret Garden: Women’s Sexual Fantasies by Nancy Friday.  She flipped to her favorite passage and read aloud in a manic whisper, parroting a woman called Wanda describing her sexual fantasy of accidentally stumbling upon a farmhouse orgy and being penetrated by a donkey as punishment. Her description was detailed and, to my elementary school ears, absolutely stupefying. I felt a lump in my stomach and a tug somewhere else.  “Did you read a book about sex last night?” my mom asked the following evening, surely, I realize now, more amused than distressed. I, terrified, denied the deed and promptly buried the visual of the donkey tryst where I hoped I would never find it. Until recently, that is, when I learned of the death of the woman who brought that particular fantasy to print. Nancy Friday died on November 5, at 84 years old, due to complications from Alzheimer’s disease. She leaves behind a contemporary world somewhat removed from the one she inhabited in 1973, when My Secret Garden was first released and the notion of women possessing sexual fantasies was, to most men, unfathomable.  “How could it be, you might ask, that women today, at the turn of the century, would still think they were the only Bad Girls with erotic thoughts?” Friday wrote in her book’s introduction. “What kind of prison is this that women impose on themselves?” Convinced that sexual agency was crucial to the fight for gender equality, Friday set out to pierce the veil of silence shrouding women’s sexual imaginations, put in place, in part, by men who were threatened by them. She compiled an anonymous compendium of women’s fantasies, from the tepid to the obscene to the delightfully bizarre. Doctor-patient fantasies, puppy play, lengthy cucumbers and big, faceless men factor into some of the more salacious scenarios, submitted to Friday via letters, in-person conversations and recorded voice calls.  Friday became interested in female fantasies after she revealed one (involving a well endowed stranger at a football game) to a lover in bed, who promptly put on his pants and exited the premises in response. The baffling encounter revealed to Friday just how great a threat women’s unsatisfied sexual potential posed to some men.  “I can see that I was only too happily enacting his indirectly stated Pygmalion-D. H. Lawrence fantasies,” she wrote. “But mine? He didn’t want to hear about them. I was not to coauthor this fascinating script on How To Be Nancy, even if it was my life. I was not to act, but to be acted upon.” My Secret Garden is an early manifestation of confessional writing, and reads almost like a proto-Tumblr or Reddit thread, with contributors sharing intimate secrets under a cloak of anonymity. Some fantasies incorporate well-trodden taboos like incest and rape, while others veer further into the surreal ― like a woman who yearns to be tantalized by an octopus from a Salvador Dali drawing.  Friday was born in 1933 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and attended an all-women’s prep school before graduating from Wellesley College. She worked as a travel reporter, editor and public relations representative soon after. My Secret Garden was her first book and became an instant best-seller, rebuffing the myth that women were somehow less sexually curious, inventive or deviant than men. Two years after its debut, Friday published a sequel titled Forbidden Flowers: More Women’s Sexual Fantasies, and went on to publish six more books focusing on the relationship between women, identity and sexuality.  My Secret Garden, which was adapted into a play in 2009 and inspired sex writer Emily Dubberley to repeat the project 40 years later with the book Garden of Desires: The Evolution of Women’s Sexual Fantasies, remains Friday’s most well-known book. In one of my favorite passages, a woman called Esther expresses not a particular fantasy but a more general way of being alone, transforming mundane reality into a playground of sexual potential. I daydream a lot, which probably accounts for the fact that I enjoy sex so often. I do my housework in the tops of baby-doll pajamas, stay in a half-hot mood most of the time, what with touching myself, or rubbing against various objects. The nozzle of the vacuum cleaner hose, for instance, played lightly over the pubic area is terrific and will bring on an orgasm if desired. Sometimes I wear a dildo inserted while doing housework. I imagine it to be my boxer dog’s prick. Many of the submissions are book-ended by disclaimers and apologies ― “I’ve never told anyone” and “Please excuse me,” verbal tics that illuminate the culture of silence and shame that Friday hoped to retire. “We’re as hidden as our clitorises,” she wrote. “By the time we’ve found them, hidden away up there, we’re guilty at having located them.” Through the act of digging up and fleshing out, documenting and sharing, Friday’s contributors begin to realize that the desires are not the problem, the culture that condemns them is. I had a similar realization, years after initially encountering Friday’s book in a dimly lit living room, when I, a student, submitted a proposal to write the weekly sex column for University of California, Berkeley’s newspaper. For my trial piece I revisited my earliest sexual fantasy, which involved the big, bad wolf from the fable of “Three Little Pigs.” It felt electric to uncover a memory I once hoped would never reach the light of day and share it with strangers, without apology. I could perfectly recall the illustration of the wolf that first sparked the strange feeling and the random, soft objects in my bedroom I used to stoke it.  With that story, I got the gig and immediately felt a surge of regret and fear. Writing cheekily about my hot and heavy childhood memories was one thing, but writing about my current desires and exploits was another entirely. The fact that my grandparents promised to read every newspaper issue added an additional layer of dread. I managed to go the entire semester without once divulging anything personal. Instead, I used generous friends’ anecdotes and observations. When summer finally came, I was as relieved as I was disappointed in myself.  I didn’t realize how hard it would be to write openly about sex until I signed up ― and then failed ― to do it. I couldn’t predict how much I cared about keeping, as Friday calls it, my “Nice Girl, Good Daughter self” intact. Discussing sex was “extreme” to my family and far worse to the Berkeley students whose nasty comments flooded the articles online, calling me an attention whore, among other expletive-laden insults.  Which is to say, what women are allowed to feel, think, say and write about sex has changed since Friday’s book was published in 1973, but not entirely. There’s still a long way to go until female masturbation is viewed as a routine, auspicious element of coming-of-age narratives, and women’s fantasies are a source of power and camaraderie rather than secrecy and guilt.  “I do think a lot of women are likely to begin fantasizing after reading this book,” Friday said in 1973. “Or rather, become aware that they have been fantasizing all along, and that these sudden odd ideas or notions they have up to now forgotten, or repressed, are indeed fantasies.”  I pray this article has a whisper of the effect. Reader, what is your fantasy? "
POLITICS,"President Donald Trump has ordered the Department of Defense to present plans for a reduction of U.S. troops in South Korea, The New York Times reported Thursday. The move comes just weeks before the president is expected to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and days after the two Koreas held a summit at the Demilitarized Zone, where they laid the foundation for a formal end to the Korean War and discussed ways to denuclearize the peninsula. The Times, citing unnamed sources briefed on the order, said Trump has been determined to reduce the number of troops in South Korea, citing the cost and the fact that their presence has done little to quash North Korea’s antagonistic nuclear weapon program. It’s unclear if Trump would push for a full or partial reduction in troop numbers, but a full reduction is unlikely. The U.S. currently has 28,500 troops stationed in the country, and South Korea, a longtime ally, pays nearly $890 million a year in expenses, or about half the total cost. That deal expires at the end of this year, and Trump hopes to convince Seoul to foot more of the bill. South Korea on Friday denied the Times’ report, saying a “key” official of the U.S. National Security Council told the country’s national security chief, Chung Eui-yong, that the news was false, Bloomberg and Reuters reported. The White House on Friday issued a statement from National Security Adviser John Bolton calling the report “utter nonsense.” Earlier this week, South Korea said that, regardless of the outcome of peace negotiations with the North, the country wanted U.S. troops to remain in the country. The comment came after a prominent adviser to President Moon Jae-in wrote that it would be “difficult to justify” the presence of U.S. forces were the conflict with Kim to end. “U.S. troops stationed in South Korea are an issue regarding the alliance between South Korea and the United States,” Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman for Seoul’s Blue House, said in a statement responding to the adviser, Moon Chung-in. “It has nothing to do with signing peace treaties.” North Korean analysts questioned the validity of Trump’s order shortly after the Times report. Experts have long said the presence of U.S. soldiers and civilians so close to North Korea has long served as a deterrent to a physical conflict. “It’s not the nuclear umbrella that keeps [the Republic of Korea] safe. It’s the 30,000 American soldiers and their families living there that do,” Melissa Hanham, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, wrote on Twitter. “It is literally the blood oath of the American people to South Korea. They value the alliance so much, that they put their lives (and their family’s lives) on the line.” Kim Jong Un is going to lead Trump right where Trump’s instinct wants to go. We may literally get a deal of some sorts if troops and extended deterrence to South Korea are on the table. And it’s not “a concession” for Trump...he wants to go there anyway. https://t.co/qZDaiQzeHV I cannot imagine a worse approach heading into the summit.  https://t.co/zgekxUIZbl Kim has long demanded the U.S. place its troop presence on the negotiating table as part of any discussions to give up its nuclear weapons, but officials have long rejected such calls. However, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis appeared to say the issue might be open to discussion. “That’s part of the issues that we’ll be discussing in negotiations with our allies first, and of course with North Korea,” Mattis said last week. “For right now, we just have to go along with process, have the negotiations and not try to make preconditions or presumptions about how it’s going to go.” This article has been updated to include Friday’s White House statement."

POLITICS,"Survey research allows us to get a sense of how the nation as a whole feels about current events, rather than trying to draw inferences from the people we know, or from the groups stating their opinions the most loudly. Sometimes, if we’re lucky, it also allows us to get a scientifically valid perspective on whatever people are yelling about on the internet. This week, that would be whether the voice in a random sound bite is saying the name “Yanny” or “Laurel.” It’s actually “Laurel.” The U.S., however, is a country where most voters don’t believe people can agree on basic facts. And when we asked 1,000 Americans to listen to the audio as part of a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, the responses showed little signs of consensus: 35 percent said “Yanny,” 31 percent said “Laurel,” and 14 percent didn’t hear either. The rest weren’t sure. The poll seemingly supports the theory that age may play a role in the differing perceptions, with younger people more attuned to the higher-frequency sounds ― and more likely to fall into the “Yanny” camp. Americans under age 30 were Team Yanny by an 18-point margin, compared to just an 8-point margin for those aged 30-44. Americans aged 45-64 and those 65 or older were Team Laurel by a 2-point margin and a 5-point margin, respectively. While we were at it, we asked our respondents to weigh in on four more pressing internet controversies (no, not The Dress ... we already did that one). And while most political polling demonstrates just how polarized the country is along partisan lines, the results of this survey suggest there are also some major generational fault lines in our assumptions on everything from the meaning of internet acronyms to how we classify our food. BuzzFeed touched off an internet firestorm when they asked earlier this month. Once again, we’re a nation divided: 29 percent say “humble,” 32 percent say “honest,” and the rest say it’s neither or that they’re not sure. And once again, there’s a notable generational divide, with younger Americans far more likely to think it’s “honest.” There’s also an educational gap, with college grads saying by an 18-point margin that it’s “humble,” and those without a degree saying by an 11-point margin that it’s “honest.” (Side note: BuzzFeed’s reader poll found “honest” winning by a significant margin. That makes sense, since the site probably has disproportionately younger readers. It’s also a good reminder that reader polls ― the kind that allow anyone browsing a website to answer, and don’t keep track of the demographics of the people responding, or use weighting to make sure they match the composition of the nation as a whole ― aren’t a representative gauge of anything beyond the opinions of the people who click on them.) The National Hot Dog and Sausage Council has weighed in. So have Stephen Colbert and John Hodgman. Here’s the court of public opinion: a 53 percent majority say no, with just 35 percent believing that it is, and the remaining 12 percent having better things to do with their lives. Results are impressively consistent along a number of demographic lines. A roughly equivalent 56 percent of Democrats, 53 percent of Republicans and 51 percent of independents agree on a hot dog’s lack of sandwich status. There’s no sign of an education, racial or gender gap either. Age, however, once again comes into play. Americans under age 45 overwhelmingly contest the hot dog’s claim to sandwichness. Their older compatriots are closer to evenly split. There’s also a regional divide, with Midwesterners most amenable to Team Sandwich, and Northeasterners by far the least so. This is another perennial debate to flare up this month, thanks to an article in The Washington Post. By a 11-point margin, 47 percent to 36 percent, Americans prefer one space.  Americans under 30 are overwhelmingly Team One Space, while those over 65 are closely divided. There’s also an educational divide, with those who hold college degrees preferring two spaces, and those without favoring just one. The creator of the GIF says it’s with a soft “G,” like “giraffe.” But he’s outnumbered: 63 percent of the American public disagrees, preferring the hard “G,” as in “gift.” Not a single demographic group examined in the survey, regardless of age, education or anything else, prefers the soft “G.”  Glad that’s all settled! The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted May 15-16 among U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling. More details on the polls’ methodology are available here. Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov’s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error."
BUSINESS,"While everyone wants to appear confident and capable, odd verbal tics and off-putting body language can jeopardize your chances of establishing or maintaining business relationships. So what habits should you ditch? All of us are probably guilty of looking down at our phones a time or two during a conversation. But it’s important to break this habit if you want to show your clients and colleagues that you really care about them. It’s hard to convey your investment in a conversation if you’re glancing at your phone every 30 seconds. Always be sure to give people your undivided attention. - Justin Lefkovitch, Mirrored Media Get out of your own head and listen and look. Be in the conversation and present. You never know what subconscious signals you are giving when you are not in the moment and looking and listening to the person you are conversing with. I am always tracking their body language and often times imitate it, as they then feel more relatable and comfortable with you. - Bryanne Lawless, BLND Public Relations This didn’t use to be an issue, but many millennials I hire have less restricted speech than most people in the office were raised with. We’re way past the age where you couldn’t even say “crap” on television, but I still think some younger employees are too casual with cursing in their everyday conversations. At the very least, a stronger filter is needed for business situations. - Matt Doyle, Excel Builders I see a lot of people who unknowingly fidget with their hands ― I used to do it myself! People might not want to do business with someone who comes across as nervous or lacking confidence. A good tactic is to consciously make an effort to casually keep one hand on top of the other, resting in your lap or on the table when other people are speaking. - Diana Goodwin, AquaMobile Genuine eye contact is the strongest key to any in-person business relationship. It’s OK to glance away while in conversation. Actually, we may seem obsessive if we don’t glance away periodically. But I often see service or sales persons visually track another person while in conversation. Be conscious that your eyes are mostly with the person you are actually talking to, and genuinely connect. - Diego Orjuela, Cables & Sensors Interrupting someone is like metaphorically punching them in the gut. Let people speak and have their two cents before you interject. When I am interrupted repeatedly by the same person, I think to myself that this guy doesn’t care what I have to say and only wants to hear himself talk. As a consequence, I never do business with those types of people, because I don’t feel comfortable with them. - Ben Walker, Transcription Outsourcing, LLC It’s better to stick to professional verbiage instead of the “yeahs” and other slang words that have snuck into our daily conversations. Save those for friends and some colleagues. It is too casual and may offend some of your business relationships, or they may not think you are professional enough to work with. - Murray Newlands, Sighted I’ve gone to meetings with people who thought they were leaving a good impression by having a “white tie” attitude and speaking as formally and professionally as possible. It’s never been an effective strategy. You may be concerned about looking as professional as possible, but you can be professional without making things stuffy or losing your personality. - Adam Steele, The Magistrate Keep eye rolling, sneering and boredom off your face when interacting with others. No matter how a person may make you feel or how you despise a situation, it’s the business relationship that comes first, so you must be professional and block this negativity from your body language. - Angela Ruth, Due It’s easy to get nervous and turn a conversation into a bunch of words that are interrupted with “umms” in-between each one. However, it detracts from your message and impression that you are trying to make. Stop and think before you speak to avoid these horrible conversation interjections. - Zach Binder, Ipseity, Inc Posture is everything. Whether you’re conscious of it or not, slouching can really give off the wrong impression. Sitting up straight shows attentiveness, confidence and even makes you appear taller. Slouching or leaning back suggests boredom, which is one impression that you do not want to give off to clients or other business professionals! - Solomon Thimothy, OneIMS Be careful not to talk around an issue. Whether giving feedback, pitching an idea or sharing an opinion, it shows respect to the other person to be direct and confident. - Douglas Baldasare, ChargeItSpot A strong professional handshake is important in making a strong first impression. Make sure that your handshake is neither too weak nor too strong, but rather firm and balanced. A poor handshake indicates a lack of interest and professionalism. Practice giving a good handshake with friends and colleagues. - Adelyn Zhou, TOPBOTS Crossing either your arms or legs during a meeting or discussion is a clear indication that you are on the defensive. It demonstrates a lack of openness to ideas and can potentially intimidate a client or business associate. It might be useful to use a bit in a sales negotiation, but in typical collaborations, crossing should be avoided. - Nicole Munoz, Start Ranking Now Many otherwise capable people end their sentences with a rising pitch rather than a lowered one. This sends the (often subconscious) message that you’re not confident or that you’re questioning what you say (we raise our pitch at the ends of questions). Speak slower and with a lowered tone at the end in order to sound confident and final. - Brennan White, Cortex — These answers are provided by the Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC), an invite-only organization comprised of the world’s most promising young entrepreneurs.

BUSINESS,"Uber reversed itself Tuesday and said it will allow tipping of drivers. Drivers in Seattle, Minneapolis and Houston can receive gratuities from passengers through the Uber smartphone app beginning Tuesday, and tipping will be allowed elsewhere in the U.S. by the end of July. The ride-hailing company announced the policy U-turn as part of its “180 days of change” initiative that aims to improve conditions for drivers. The company is trying to cut down on driver turnover. Only 4 percent of Uber drivers stick with the company for more than a year, a study found, and compensation is the primary reason for leaving. Uber called the change “the right thing to do” and “long overdue” in a company blog post. Uber competitor Lyft has allowed tipping since 2012. As of Monday, its drivers have collected more than $250 million in tips. New York’s Independent Drivers Guild, which represents 50,000 ride-hailing drivers in New York City, welcomed the news as a big step toward better wages. “Today’s tipping announcement is an important win for drivers and proves that thousands of drivers coming together with one voice can make big changes,“ Jim Conigliaro Jr, founder of the group, said in a statement emailed to HuffPost. “Cuts to driver pay across the ride-hail industry have made tipping income more important than ever,” Conigliaro said. “We were proud to lead the way on this fight on behalf of drivers in New York City and across the nation. This is an important first step toward a more fair ride-hail industry.” Uber also announced seven other policy changes for drivers, including eliminating unpaid wait times, an increased base fare for teenage passengers, and the option for drivers to pick up and drop off passengers while en route to a pre-set destination. "
ENTERTAINMENT,"It’s been well-established that no one can bend it like David Beckham, but who knew no one could hug quite like him either?  The former footballer rang in his 43rd birthday on Wednesday with a surprise appearance from his oldest son, Brooklyn. The family was out celebrating at a London restaurant when the 19-year-old snuck up behind his father in a video shared on both David and wife Victoria Beckham’s Instagram accounts.  David became instantly emotional, tearing up as his son pulled him in for a sweet embrace.  “What are you doing here?” a clearly overwhelmed David said in the video after giving him a kiss on the cheek. “I missed you so much.” A post shared by David Beckham (@davidbeckham) on May 2, 2018 at 2:25pm PDT “Best birthday surprise, my big boy coming home,” the father of four captioned the post.  The family’s other members, daughter Harper Seven and younger sons Romeo and Cruz, who all reside in London, were also in attendance. Brooklyn, meanwhile, lives in New York where he studies photography at The Parsons School of Design. In the video, Harper can be heard reacting to her big brother’s birthday surprise, exclaiming, “I didn’t know Brooklyn was coming.” The Spice Girl singer also shared a family photo from the big day of her husband and the three younger children posing sweetly together.  “Happy birthday to the best daddy!! X we all love u so much!!! So many kisses from us all xxxx we miss u @brooklynbeckham X,” she wrote, signaling that perhaps she didn’t even know the 19-year-old would soon crash the festivities.  A post shared by Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham) on May 1, 2018 at 11:51pm PDT She also posted an adorable video of Harper, 6, reading from a handwritten birthday card for her father.  A post shared by Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham) on May 1, 2018 at 11:49pm PDT Victoria often gives updates about the Beckham brood on her social media, recently hinting that one of her sons might be following in her musical footsteps sometime soon.  In a video shared earlier this week, 13-year-old Cruz channels his inner Justin Bieber by belts out an unknown track for his mom.  “And I miss you, girl, like sunlight misses the moon,” Cruz sang. “And I pray that I’ll be back inside your arms one day soon.” A post shared by Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham) on Apr 30, 2018 at 12:36am PDT Um, can they please adopt us because this family is so adorable it hurts."
BUSINESS,"Snap Inc, owner of popular messaging service Snapchat, made many of its financial details public for the first time on Thursday, as it prepared to raise up to $3 billion in an initial public offering in New York that is expected to come in March. The disclosure was Snap’s opening salvo in convincing investors that the company, which launched in 2012 as a free mobile app with disappearing messages, has come up with a sustainable business model despite increasing losses. Snap had confidentially registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission late last year and kept the prospectus under such tight wraps that even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first U.S. company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between $20 billion to $25 billion, sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential have said. That would give the company the richest valuation in a U.S. technology IPO since Facebook Inc. Snap, which described itself as a camera company in the IPO prospectus, started selling $130 video camera glasses last year. It has also sought to bulk up revenues from advertising, where it generates the majority of its revenue. Snap had $404.5 million in sales in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, it had a net loss of $514.6 million in 2016, up from a net loss of $372.9 million in 2015. It had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, up from $292 million the year before. Snap had 158 million active users in 2016, up 48 percent from 2015. Facebook’s Instagram, which recently introduced disappearing video content similar to Snapchat, had 600 million users as of late last year. Like Snapchat, Instagram sells advertising on its platform. Snap pointed to a decline in the growth rate of its user base as a risk, as well as its reliance on Google Cloud and certain operating systems. All companies must include risk factors in their prospectus, and the first ones listed are often those of most concern. TIGHT CONTROL Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned $503,205 in salary, with a $1 million bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat’s chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned $241,539 last year with a $5.2 million bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap’s stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can “vote with their feet” by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. By the end of last year, Snap had increased its number of employees to 1,859 from 600 in 2015 as it aggressively expanded its business. Snap said it would use the proceeds from its IPO for general purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Snap said it will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker SNAP."

""The apparel oft proclaims the man, "" advises Polonius to Laertes. And Thomas Carlyle would write a novel entitled Sartor Resartus, literally ""tailor re-tailored."" But what about woman?  If we take the cover of the recent swimsuit issue of Sports Illustrated, where the model Hannah Davis, flaunts her mons pubis can we conclude that neither clothes nor hair make the woman? The shot leaves little to the imagination, but there is little to imagine. What if Joanna Hiffernan the model for Courbet's ""The Origin of the World,"" who also happened to be an inspiration to Whistler, had struck a similar pose. Hiffernan's pulling her bikini bottom down would have been a far more far more sensational news event. The current epidemic of Brazilian waxing, of which Ms. Davis is apparently the latest public victim (Kim Kardashian's recent spread in Paper  is another prominent example of a similar phenomenon) has reduced the female genitalia to a state of pre-pubescent nothingness. Pedophiles must be entralled. The Sports Illustrated issue has raised some eyebrows, but when you scour the newsstand to see what all the hullabaloo is about you almost need to be told that something provocative is going on. A risqué pose with a model in a state of undress is nothing new, but what's disconcerting is to find a sheep in wolf's clothing, a little girl in the guise of a woman. Unless of course you have a predilection for these kinds of things, you could pass the newsstands where the Sports Illustrated cover is brazenly displayed, thinking that the female genitalia had actually been whited out. It's reminiscent of another parable, the Emperor's New Clothes, but also of the experience of dining in one of those trendy new restaurants where you pay a lot for very little and a chorus of praise accompanies minuscule portions which are nearly impossible to see. {This was originally posted to The Screaming Pope, Francis Levy's blog of rants and reactions to contemporary politics, art and future}"
POLITICS,"Attorneys for Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens are pushing for a police investigation into the prosecutor’s office for alleged misconduct during her handling the governor’s felony invasion of privacy case, The Associated Press reported on Tuesday.  St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, the prosecutor, dropped charges against Greitens on Monday after a judge ruled the defense would be allowed to call Gardner to the witness stand during the trial. Greitens’ lawyers claim Gardner allowed a private investigator to commit perjury and withhold evidence from defense attorneys, according to the AP.  Ed Dowd, one of Greitens’ attorneys, told the AP that the legal team would be filing a report with the St. Louis police over the alleged misconduct.  Greitens’ criminal charge stemmed from an admitted 2015 extramarital affair with his hairdresser, an unidentified woman who claims her encounters with him weren’t always consensual. The woman initially claimed that during her time with Greitens, who was then preparing his campaign for governor, he took nude photos of her without her permission. Later, she said she may have imagined that photos were being taken of her. The woman also alleged that Greitens forced her to the ground and coerced her into having oral sex, according to a Missouri House special investigative committee’s report released last month. While Gardner’s office dropped the charge on Monday, it also asked the judge to assign a special prosecutor to refile the charge in order to take the case to trial. “The court’s order leaves the Circuit Attorney no adequate means of proceeding with this trial. Therefore, the court has left the Circuit Attorney with no other legal option than to dismiss and refile this matter,” Gardner’s office released in a statement after the charge was dropped. Gardner told HuffPost in a statement that she is not surprised by the “continued theatrics” by Greitens’ legal team. “I knew when I began investigating the Governor that his high-priced defense team would use whatever means possible to attack my team and me in court and through the media,” Gardner told HuffPost. “How did I know? Twice Governor Greitens’ team of attorneys came to my office and threatened my staff and me with the continued barrage of insults and accusations if we continued to pursue charges against the Governor.” The circuit attorney said that the actions of Greitens’ defense attorneys didn’t worry her and that there was not “one shred of evidence” that the private investigator assisting her office, William Don Tisaby, committed any illegal actions. “Often times, powerful people use whatever financial means available to stop prosecutors from seeking the truth,” Gardner told HuffPost in a statement. “This is not the first time (nor will it be the last) in American history when an elected official was under investigation and they attacked the investigation itself to redirect the focus from their client to something else.”"
POLITICS,"President Donald Trump broke the news to French President Emmanuel Macron that he was planning to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement in a call on Tuesday morning, The New York Times reported. The U.S. president plans to reinstate all of the sanctions that had been waived as part of the deal while also slapping on new “economic penalties,” a person briefed on the conversation told the news outlet. Sources also told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the U.S. will violate the deal but did not share any details. France, the U.K. and Germany, the three European co-signatories on the deal, have been working with the Trump administration in recent weeks in an attempt to change Trump’s mind. Officials from all three countries visited Washington, D.C., to make their appeals in person, to no avail. The discussions fell apart, a second person familiar with the negotiations said, around limits on Iran’s nuclear output after 2030.  The president has been critical of the 2015 agreement meant to curb Iran’s nuclear program, calling it “one of the most incompetently drawn deals I’ve seen” last October. According to NBC and the Times, Trump administration officials have begun to alert congressional leaders of his plans. The president is expected to make a formal announcement on the agreement at 2 p.m. ET Tuesday at the White House. This article has been updated."
BUSINESS,"
By Rafael Ilishayev  Entrepreneurs today like to throw around the term ""disruption"" as unreservedly as they like to call themselves ""entrepreneurs."" But in an atmosphere where serendipity can make you and 140 characters can break you, a little funding doesn't make you an entrepreneur per se, and a decent idea doesn't necessarily mean you've disrupted an industry. In 2013, my co-founder and I started goPuff, an on-demand delivery service application. Despite the impression our company has made in the on-demand industry since then, we are reminded every day of how fragile success truly is. While we just recently secured our Series B round of funding, our team maintains the philosophy that disruption, at its inception, is not about reinventing the wheel -- it's about making it work better.  The innovation, the glitz, and the internet-shattering ideas will follow, but only if you've uncovered a real problem and offered a real solution first. Here are some tips for disrupting your own business: Understand the cultural climate. Get this: cereal sales have continued to decline since you enjoyed it while watching Saturday morning cartoons when you were six years old. Why? Because all you have to accomplish between waking up and going to sleep leaves no time left over to sit down for a bowl of Frosted Flakes, much less the patience to clean the bowl and put it away. Our fast-paced, time-sensitive work culture has forced cereal companies to adopt grab-and-go formats such as cereal bars and pre-packaged single-serving cereal bowls, meaning that how we consume today has evolved as much as our habits have.  Try creating a catalyst (read: product or service) that will impact and improve the consumer's life as it is affected by shifting cultural norms. At my company, we've cultivated loyalty by presenting our customers with the opportunity to be loyal -- we strive to give them what they want, when they want it, every single time. If you focus on an experience that customers can count on to work with and for their lifestyle, you'll create more than just a service for them.  Understand the competition. Prior to launching our company, we believed delivery as usual was not cutting it. The only thing that separates on-demand delivery services from what they were, and what they are today, is the product the user orders. This is why you should try to disrupt your business model: After all, we know that while a product may be innovative, a service is disruptive. 
 The solution is to not only look at what your competition isn't doing, but also at what they are doing. Then, work against it. We try to root our idea of loyalty in our consistency: We guarantee customers that their convenience store items will arrive by a certain amount of time for a small flat fee. Your business model should discourage users from looking to competitors for comparable service. If you get it right the first time, you'll have that customer's business every time.  Understand the customer. In a world ruled by technology, everyone is a customer. What unites us all, especially Millennials and Gen-Zers, is that because we are so inundated by choice, we are skeptical consumers. We want to try what's new and trendy, but usually by recommendation, and only if it's sustainable and efficient on a long-term basis.  Listen to your users: You've created a new experience. Now, how can you make it better? We've built a business model that helps suss out customer demand. For example, when our customers ask us to bring our service to their city, expand product variety, lower prices, and make delivery times faster, we listen. This provides us not only operational leverage, but also interpersonal leverage. For your business, you could also try running exclusive contests and promotions for your customers and creating unique partnerships with their favorite brands and companies. When you control the entire customer experience from A to Z, you are constantly evolving from within. There's a difference between disrupting your industry and disrupting yourself. If you're starting a business for the fancy title, stick to the former. But if you want to make real change, touch lives and really shake things up, lead your revolution through the latter. Rafael Ilishayev is the co-founder of GoPuff."
ARTS & CULTURE,"The term ""extended family"" can have a very different meaning for one person than it does for another. For people whose extended families have grown strictly through marriage, their extended family is defined by nieces, nephews, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law and, in some cases, children who were adopted. For others, their extended family forms a loving circle of trusted and trustworthy friends who can be relied upon for advice, compassion, and companionship when blood relations are geographically or emotionally distant.  Or simply unavailable. Sometimes these ""chosen"" extended families contain people with shared interests, friends in common, or ex-lovers. Sometimes they consist of neighbors, coworkers, and casual acquaintances. But as a person grows older, their steady presence often allows for a more intimate sharing of thoughts and emotions than one might experience with relatives who may bring too much baggage to the table. I've been extremely fortunate in life to have enjoyed the benefits of a remarkable extended family that began to form long before the onset of social networking. Many of these people hold cherished places in my heart, mind, and memory. One of those friendships came to an end when a woman I met more than 50 years ago passed away last summer on my birthday. Two recent stories (one on film, the other onstage) highlight the role an extended family can play in the lives of ordinary people. While the situations in these two stories are wildly different, they point to the need for connection and inclusion as well as a sense of spiritual, intellectual, and emotional intimacy. * * * * * * * * * * Directed by Sara Dosa, The Last Season is set in Central Oregon, where migrant workers arriving for the two-month mushroom hunting season find their treasured crop vastly diminished by a lack of rain. This documentary, however, is not about the mushrooms so much as it is about a most unusual friendship. Roger Higgins was a trained sniper in the United States Special Forces in Vietnam. Now 75, the recovering alcoholic is in failing health and must rely on an oxygen tank and cane for physical support. A heavy smoker (despite the fact that he is wearing a nasal cannula), Roger and his wife Theresa live in an isolated cabin in the woods where Theresa must decide whether or not to call an ambulance if Roger's health takes a precipitous turn for the worse. Although he can still shoot at squirrels, Roger occasionally suffers from episodes of posttraumatic stress disorder in the form of vivid nightmares. His time is running out.  Roger Higgins in The Last Season  Kouy Loch was a platoon leader in Cambodia's Khmer Freedom Fighters who battled the Khmer Rouge. Following his mother's death from uterine cancer, he has been raising his daughter who, at nine years of age, is saving up for a trip to Disneyland. One of many migrant workers who comes to Oregon to hunt the rare matsutake mushroom (which brings top dollar from clients in Japan), Kouy seems fairly spry. The truth, however, is that he lost part of his left leg after stepping on a land mine (during the film he removes his prosthesis for the camera to reveal his post-surgical stump). The Last Season - SFIFF 57 Clip from San Francisco Film Society on Vimeo. After the two men met during mushroom hunting season, they developed a friendship once they realized that they were both war veterans who had shared similar experiences fighting against the Vietnamese. By the time Dosa's documentary begins, their friendship has grown to the point where Kouy stays with Roger and his wife during mushroom season. He is more than happy to help out around their house, fixing things that Roger can no longer fix, and helping Theresa understand what happens when someone experiences an episode of PTSD.  Poster art for The Last Season  Dosa's film (which was screened at CAAMFest 2015) captures some intensely personal moments, such as when Kouy asks Roger and Theresa if they would become his new parents. One can easily sense the deep emotions felt by a childless elderly couple and a middle-aged man who lost his biological parents long ago. The Last Season is a very quiet, intimate, and low-key documentary in which Theresa and Kouy are acutely aware that the ornery Roger's time is running out. It has many touching moments, especially after Kouy starts addressing Roger as ""Dad"" and Theresa as ""Mother."" * * * * * * * * * * Down in Palo Alto, TheatreWorks Silicon Valley recently presented the West Coast premiere of The Lake Effect by Rajiv Joseph. As a playwright, Joseph has had a close relationship with TheatreWorks since 2009, when The North Pool was featured in the company's annual New Works Festival. A co-commission by the Crossroads Theatre Company in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and Silk Road Rising in Chicago, Illinois, The Lake Effect represents an interesting hybrid of artistic missions. The artistic mission of Crossroads is: ""...to provide a nurturing working environment for writers and artistic collaborators through supporting the commissioning, development, presentation, and documentation of new scripts while celebrating the culture, history, spirit, and voices of the entire African Diaspora. The company aims to educate audiences by creating bridges of understanding between people of all cultural backgrounds in this society and the world and to use art to provoke and challenge a multicultural audience to a higher sense of communion."" Formerly known as the Silk Road Theatre Project, Silk Road Rising aims ""to commission and develop new plays that can enrich the fabric of American storytelling by advancing a polycultural worldview with an emphasis on discovery, empathy, and pluralism."" For a talented playwright like Mr. Joseph, this co-commission opened up some new paths and allowed him to set The Lake Effect in his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio. As the playwright explains: ""I'm always interested in the relationships between minority groups and how they might interact, intersect, conflict -- it's a very rich story, one that tells a deeper story of America, beyond white and black.  There are things that happen in the play that can spark debate about holding grudges, and being estranged, and also forgiveness. And finding your family where you least expect it."" Sensitively directed by Giovanna Sardelli (who has worked with Mr. Joseph on all of his plays), The Lake Effect takes place on a bitter cold night in Cleveland as Vijay (Adam Poss) is struggling to make sense of his sick father's financial records. His concentration is shattered by the arrival of Bernard (Jason Bowen), an African-American bookie who has become extremely close to Vijay's father, Vinnie, in the past year and, as usual, has come to the restaurant hungry for food and companionship.  Jason Bowen is Bernard in The Lake Effect
(Photo by: Kevin Berne)   Bernard and Vinnie used to take frequent walks together to Lake Erie and, among other things, discuss the ups and downs of the tempestuous marriage between Vinnie's daughter, Priya (Nilanjana Bose) and her African-American husband. Although Vinnie had always been extremely cautious with his money, after meeting Bernard he started placing bets on football games and winning with the kind of accuracy that could make someone believe he was psychic. However, in all the time that Bernard has known Vinnie (whom Bernard claims saved his life), he has never heard the restaurant's owner mention the fact that he had a son. When Priya arrives from Florida, sibling tensions quickly start to heat up. Vijay is irked by the fact that Priya knows the combination to the restaurant's safe and obviously has some history with Bernard.

BUSINESS,"Starbucks announced a new policy of inclusivity on Saturday that will permit anyone to sit in its cafes or use the stores’ restrooms, regardless of whether they’ve bought anything, The Associated Press reported. The move comes weeks after one of the coffee chain’s stores in Philadelphia incited outrage for calling the police on two black men who had not made a purchase while they waited for a friend to arrive. “We are committed to creating a culture of warmth and belonging where everyone is welcome,” the company said in a statement. @Starbucks The police were called because these men hadn’t ordered anything. They were waiting for a friend to show up, who did as they were taken out in handcuffs for doing nothing. All the other white ppl are wondering why it’s never happened to us when we do the same thing. pic.twitter.com/0U4Pzs55Ci Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson were arrested for “trespassing” on April 12 after a Starbucks store manager in Philadelphia called the police. Nelson said he’d asked the manager if he could use the restroom when he arrived in the cafe but was told the facilities were for paying customers only. The men said they’d been waiting for a friend to arrive when the police arrived and they were arrested ― mere minutes after they’d entered the store. Their arrest, captured on camera, quickly became a public relations nightmare for Starbucks. Protests erupted at the Philadelphia store and demonstrators accused the cafe’s staff of racism. The manager no longer works for the company.  The company moved quickly to control the damage. Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson flew to Philadelphia soon after the incident to personally meet with the two men, who later settled with the company for an undisclosed sum and free college tuition for an online program created by Starbucks for its employees. Separately, they got a symbolic $1 each from the city of Philadelphia and a pledge from officials to set up a $200,000 to promote entrepreneurship among high school students. Johnson also announced plans to close more than 8,000 Starbucks stores in the U.S. on May 29 so workers can receive training about racial bias. Starbucks said Saturday that going forward, its employees had been told to “consider anyone who walks into its stores a customer” ― whether or not they buy anything, reported AP. The company noted, however, that law enforcement will be notified if a customer appears to pose a threat to safety. Starbucks founder and chairman Howard Schultz said last week that while the company doesn’t “want to become a public bathroom... we’re going to make the right decision 100 percent of the time and give people the key.” “We don’t want anyone at Starbucks to feel as if we are not giving access to you to the bathroom because you are less than. We want you to be more than,” Schultz said during a Thursday discussion at Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank, according to Bloomberg. "

All Photographs (c) Tim Allen, Courtesy of Tim Allen Social documentary need not always be focused around the public space. Indeed, these people are in a private workplace, and yet these photographs are certainly a form of social documentary. Most definitions of social documentary photography contain some reference to ""humans in their natural state"". I find this intriguing, as one might argue that work is indeed a ""natural state"" for humans. Some people may not feel that work is their natural state, then again, as Bruce Robinson said, ""If you are a junkyard dog, you assume that that's what life is: chained up, barking all day.""  And yet, work need not be a negative experience. Confucius says, ""Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life."" This might indeed be true, as evidenced here, in these photographs, there is certainly a passion at work, not merely just a person. I was immediately drawn to these photographs, and I think Tim Allen's project is a worthy and noble one.  Here is photographer Tim Allen in his own words: My story starts in 2013 when I self-published a small photo book based on my visits to traditional fairgrounds called '3 Balls £2.50'. Using social media to promote the project, I raised £450 for The National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society and I decided to follow it with a larger project. I settled on a theme of traditional crafts, but the big question was whether I could find the craftsmen and women to photograph. What I was forgetting, of course, is that people who are so passionate about what they do want to share their skills and keep their profession alive for future generations. One rainy Sunday afternoon I sent ten emails; a week later was excited to see that five people had said yes.   The first visit was to a stained-glass studio and, after a nervous first few minutes, I suddenly felt right at home with what I was doing. With my nerves about the project's viability now eased, I couldn't wait to visit more craftspeople and see them working with such skill and enthusiasm. After a couple of months, I had visited a violin restorer, a boat restoration yard, a stonemason, and a blacksmith. Everybody I met was totally devoted to their craft and keen to show me and talk about what they did in great detail.   I published my second book, 'Artisans', in August 2014, and so far it has raised over £1,500 for NASS. In January 2015, I was able to visit four new participants, which I hope to be able to feature in a second book in the future. I photographed a coppersmith, a leather designer, a 'trug' basket making workshop, and a bronze foundry. And, I still have others interested in being photographed. The project has been based in the South East of England and it's pleasing to see such a variety of crafts thriving in the area.      The whole project can be seen on Tim's website at TimAllenPhoto.co.uk. Tim Allen has been interested in photography since 2007, when he bought a used DSLR. He firmly believes in only shooting what interests him - what others think isn't that important. Living in Kent means he has easy access to London - a large photographic playground. in front of me. Tim prefers to work on projects, but is also happy to just wander the streets and see what happens in front of him."
ARTS & CULTURE,"If you want to hear Donald Trump’s inauguration speech, but for any number of reasons can’t bear to look the man directly in the face while doing so, artist Rachel Mason has offered an alternative. Performing as her alter ego, FutureClown, Mason plans to lip-synch Trump’s inaugural address in a live YouTube performance taking place at the exact same time as the real swearing-in ceremony. The performance was recorded live from LACE, and it’s currently the main feature on Art F City. Given the bizarre atmosphere of Washington, D.C., on Friday morning, the clown ensemble seems quite appropriate.  Mason has long used her clown counterpart to tackle political events that seemed somewhat out of this world. In a 2013 interview with The Huffington Post, she said of the character: “It is me, and it allows me to do the things that I want to do.” Mason, as FutureClown, lip-synced the entirety of a Republican debate last year. “Obviously with Donald Trump being a viable candidate, it really blurs the line between reality and fiction,” she said at the time.  For many, watching a futuristic clown sworn in as president seems less strange than the real thing. "
BUSINESS,"Aging Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders may need to rethink how susceptible they are to fraudulent offers and scams. A new survey by the AARP, the nation’s largest senior advocacy group, revealed that AAPI individuals are frequent targets of scammers, yet they are overly confident in their abilities to spot a scam. The organization surveyed a sample of 1,120 AAPI individuals ages 50 and older from across the country and published its findings last week. According to AARP, 72 percent of those surveyed reported that they or their families were targets of fraud. Thirty-nine percent said they were victims of fraud ― and one-third of those people lost money (an average of $15,246). The most common scams that participants encountered were foreign lottery winnings, requests for charitable donations, fake requests for IRS back taxes and email phishing scams. While a majority of participants (73 percent) said they felt confident they could identify fraudulent offers, 71 percent of people failed AARP’s fraudulent offer knowledge quiz, which included six true-or-false questions on foreign lotteries, wiring money to strangers and other types of scams. Robert E. Roush, a professor of geriatrics at Baylor College of Medicine, told HuffPost in an email that he didn’t know why the majority of AAPI individuals felt confident about identifying fraud when only a minority passed the test ― but he did warn that other factors, including dementia or head injuries, could have affected some of the participants’ answers. Roush was not involved in AARP’s study. AARP will use this new information to develop new programs within the organization. “We hope that the findings will also be helpful and useful to policy makers and the AAPI community to guide their work,” Daphne Kwok, AARP’s vice president of AAPI strategy, told HuffPost A new AARP survey finds that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are susceptible to financial fraud https://t.co/sfQOePkErp pic.twitter.com/Iz4N8RUSra It is no secret that scammers frequently target American seniors. A 2017 review of 12 studies found that 1 in 18 older Americans are victims of financial fraud every year. However, few studies look into how scams and fraud affect different groups of seniors.  “Fraud is an issue that cuts across ethnic groups and older adults are particularly vulnerable to losing a lifetime of hard-earned savings,” Kwok told HuffPost in an email, adding that fraud prevention is one of the organization’s top priorities. So far, AARP has only conducted this study for the AAPI community. The organization singled out AAPI elders first because there is not enough data or research “on the AAPI community in general,” according to Kwok. “Especially disaggregated AAPI data,” she added, “which is critical to truly address and understand the specific needs and challenges of the diverse AAPI community.” For the survey, AARP conducted phone interviews in English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Tagalog, Vietnamese and Korean with AAPI individuals ages 50 or over.  While the study does not suggest that scammers are targeting AAPI individuals more frequently than people from other ethnic groups, it does reveal that they react in a particular way. “Cultural or language elements do seem related to the types of fraud that they are more likely to be hit by and also what the impact will be,” Angela Houghton, AARP’s senior research adviser and the survey’s author, explained to HuffPost in an email. For example, focus groups hosted by the National Asian Pacific Center on Aging, or NACPA, revealed that older AAPI individuals are worried that language barriers make them more likely targets for fraud. But according to Houghton, the survey’s results suggested that people with a limited understanding of English were also less likely to engage in activities that made them more vulnerable to fraud. “Behaviors such as being more active with banking/financial transactions and being digitally connected tend to increase the risk of fraud,” Houghton said. “Ironically, this results in lower exposure for some of the sub-groups normally expected to be more vulnerable [AAPI individuals who are older, less acculturated and with a limited English proficiency] because they are less likely to engage in them.” However, languages barriers can still put AAPI individuals at risk: Houghton warned that those with a limited understanding of English may be less likely to identify a scammer if they do encounter one. “And once fraud occurs, we saw that those with limited English skills are less likely to report it,” Houghton added. Language barriers may also make it more difficult for AAPI people to learn about scammers and the risks of fraud, which is why AARP’s researchers highlighted the importance of having “in-language consumer information and access to culturally appropriate fraud resources in the community.” AAPI seniors said they lacked access to these types of language-specific materials and resources in 2017, according to NACPA. One of the most concerning findings of the survey was AAPI seniors’ reluctance to talk about or report incidents to authorities. One in 3 victims did not tell anyone ― including friends or family ― about the fraud or how it affected them, though an overwhelming majority of victims (72 percent) said the experience hurt their physical, emotional and mental health. The effects included anger, stress or depression, feelings of shame and embarrassment, and family conflict or divorce. AAPI victims’ reluctance to talk about or report fraud could be due to cultural barriers. According to NACPA, they may not report fraud because of immigration status, cultural behavior (such as a tendency to stay silent) or a belief that endurance and suffering is a virtue.  Participants in one NACPA focus group in 2017 described these cultural barriers: One Chinese participant told NACPA that Asian families are more reserved about their personal matters, which could make it more difficult for elders to seek help when they are exploited. Roush also agreed that cultural elements ― including the virtue of respecting elders, also known as filial piety ― may prevent AAPI victims from reporting fraud. “Filial piety, a cultural trait common among Asians, could be a factor here: Elders are revered and expect to be taken care of by younger family members,” Roush told HuffPost. “So perhaps they are especially reluctant to tell others, especially family and close friends.” More needs to be done to educate AAPI seniors facing language barriers about the risks of scams and fraud, AARP’s researchers concluded. The researchers said it’s important to distribute information in multiple languages, and warned of the emotional damage that fraud can cause. “A significant number of AAPI fraud victims do not tell anyone about the fraud,” the researchers wrote. “By not telling anyone, victims are left to suffer alone and likely without gaining any wisdom about what steps to take next to protect themselves in the future.” For Kwok, educating the community is the best way to prevent people from falling victim to fraud. “Awareness and education really is key to preventing fraud,” she told NBC News.  “The more conversations we can spark within the community and families around this issue, the less likely AAPIs will become victims.” Read AARP’s findings below.

BUSINESS,"Hackers breached MyFitnessPal, a popular calorie-counting app and website, and acquired private data from about 150 million users. Under Armour Inc., which owns the nutritional app, announced Thursday that an “unauthorized party” gained access to the data in late February. Information acquired by the hackers included user names, email addresses and hashed passwords, the company said. Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers were not affected since the app doesn’t collect that information. Payment card information was also unaffected because the company collects and processes that information separately.  The company says it does not know the identity of the party responsible for the security breach. MyFitnessPal allows users to track their daily meals, count how many calories they consume and search for the nutritional information of specific foods. In a notice to the app’s users, Under Armour Chief Digital Officer Paul Fipps said the company learned of the breach on Sunday. The company alerted its users four days later. “We are working with leading data security firms to assist in our investigation,” Fipps wrote. “We have also notified and are coordinating with law enforcement authorities.” The company is urging MyFitnessPal users to change their passwords immediately.  Under Armour is the latest victim of a string of security breaches affecting companies in all industries. Orbitz, a travel booking site, announced this month that it had a security breach that affected about 880,000 payment cards from the site’s users. Equifax also announced this month that it had another massive data breach affecting 2.4 million customers in 2017, six months after it revealed a previous breach that affected 143 million additional people. Other major organizations to face widespread security breaches in recent years include Yahoo, Uber and the Pentagon."

He also asked for spousal support. According to People, the filing featured the names “Rob Doe vs. Veronica Doe.” The two separated in mid-November. The “Thelma & Louise” star and Jarrahy, a plastic surgeon, tied the knot on Sept. 1, 2001. It was Davis’ fourth marriage.

ARTS & CULTURE,"When Pearl Mackie began the audition process for “Doctor Who,” she didn’t know she was auditioning for “Doctor Who.” She’d been starring in the West End production of “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time” when her agent asked if she was available to tryout for a part in a show called “Mean Town.” With little more information, Mackie said she was free and agreed to wait for more details on the opportunity. When her agent contacted her again, she told the actress that “Mean Town” wasn’t actually a show, it was an anagram for “Woman Ten.” Turns out, Mackie wasn’t just auditioning for a poorly titled drama or sitcom, she was now in the running to become the newest female companion on “Doctor Who” Season 10.  “I was like, riiight, OK, I’m never gonna get that,” the London-born Mackie told The Huffington Post in a phone interview. Long story short, she did. After an initial audition, she performed lines alongside a theatrical Peter Capaldi, the resident Doctor entering into his final season as a time-traveling alien this year.  “He’s running pressing buttons and pulling levers, because he knows where everything is in the TARDIS,” Mackie recounted. “And I’m sort of just standing, open-mouthed, looking around in wonder, kind of thinking ― What is going on here? This is the maddest experience of my life. I’ve just had the most intense experience, and I can’t even tell anyone about it.” Secrecy is par for the course when it comes to the BBC show, which ran for 26 seasons between the 1960s and 1980s, only to return in a 2005 revival that’s about to air its Season 10 premiere on BBC America on April 15. But Mackie’s character, Bill Potts, is anything but traditional. According to The Guardian, she’ll be the show’s first openly gay companion, a woman who’s been described as “completely fresh and new,” perhaps due in part to the fact that the actress behind the role has never really watched more than one episode of the show. Check out our entire interview with Mackie, in which we talked about her character’s persona, the pressures of joining the “Doctor Who” family, and what representation on television means to her. I love your character’s name ― Bill. Is there anything behind the name? Is it short for anything? Well, no, not as far as I know. She’s just called Bill! I wondered the same, but I haven’t discovered anything, unless they’ve got big plans for a reveal later on. No, as far as I know, it’s just Bill. Fans have been speculating that Bill is from the ‘80s and that there might be a parallel to a former “Who” companion, Ace ― is any of this true? I’ve read that “Doctor Who” showrunner Steven Moffat has hinted otherwise. She is not from the ‘80s, no. She is very much from now. She’s very much a present-day woman. Kind of a normal young woman, really. Kind of a nod there, in her vintage-inspired outfits, but she’s definitely not from the ‘80s. Is there anything else you can tell us about Bill’s origins that won’t incite utter rage from the BBC? Yeah! In terms of personality, she’s very open and she’s very real. When I read Steven’s script, I was very struck by how fully rounded the character was. Not sort of struck in terms of being surprised by Steven’s writing ― because, I mean, we all know how good that is ― but it was very much more that I felt she was already there. She had a history. She felt like a real person that you would meet. And someone that you’d like. She’s quite open. She’s quite honest ― sometimes to her detriment. She doesn’t necessarily always think things through before saying them. But I don’t do that very well either, so maybe that’s why I related to her. But yeah, she’s quite witty and quite intelligent and very human and driven by her gut and the way she feels about things, which is something that I really liked. Do we know how old she is or where she was born? I mean, she’s about early 20s, I would say. Yeah, that kind of age. Aaand I don’t know if I can say where she’s born. In the U.K.! To be vague. Well, obviously the entire “Doctor Who” universe is filled with a ton of secrecy and a lot of these really really dedicated fans. I saw that kids are already dressing up as your character online. What has your life as a companion been like so far ― even before the show has aired? It’s been kind of a whirlwind. It’s sort of like being welcomed into like the biggest, most enthusiastic family at a family gathering and being introduced to them all at the same time. And, you know, everyone’s got really strong opinions about what it is you’re about to do, which can be a little bit overwhelming at times. But I think, for me, it’s been amazing. It’s such a wonderful thing to be part of a show that means so much to so many people. You know, people relate to “Doctor Who” in such a personal way, which I think is why people have their own personal favorite Doctor, their favorite companion, their favorite monsters, their favorite episodes. It’s a very strong relationship for a lot of people. And it’s been wonderful to be to be welcomed so wholeheartedly into it. Did you do any particular research before you took on the role? Did you brush up on any of the history or any of the fan theories? You know, I didn’t watch much of “Doctor Who” when I was a kid. I didn’t watch any of the feature series ― I think I’ve watched one episode. But obviously you’d have to be living in some type of a hole to not be aware of the show. After getting the job, I said to Steven and [executive producer] Brian [Minchin], “Look, give me the back catalog and let me watch everything.” And they said, “Well, what you’re doing at the moment is great. You’re bringing a really nice sort of freshness to it. And, you know, you experiencing things as Bill is kind of experiencing things seemed to work really well. So don’t watch it!” And also, I kind of felt like as an actor watching someone play what is essentially your role [as a companion] and watching them do it so well, it would be hard not to borrow a little bit here and there, even subconsciously. And I really didn’t want to do that because I thought Bill was supposed to be completely fresh and completely new to this. So I thought it was best not to [watch].   Did Peter Capaldi or some of the other cast and crew members give you any memorable advice during your first moments on set? Peter was great. He gave me a little card and a scented candle for my new flat in Cardiff. It was really sweet. It’s such a big beast of a show, you know, in terms of its its reach and its fan base and all the extra little bits that make up the world of Doctor Who. But he said, “Remember why you’re here. You’re here because you’re really good.” Which was very kind of him to say. “The acting is what you’re here to do ― that’s the main job. We’re here to create this show and everything else is on top. But all of that can be a bit too much sometimes. It can seem like a lot, but if it does, here’s my number. Feel free to have a chat with me about it if anything seems too overwhelming.” Which was very lovely. The trailer for the upcoming “Who” season contains the line, “2017 needs us.” And Peter Capaldi has hinted in interview that while Season 9 began to reflect on the modern world a bit more, he thinks we might see more of that in Season 10. Does this mean we’re going to hear about contemporary politics at all on the show? Ummm, there might be some areas of contemporary politics in this series. Yes, indeed. But not in a very direct way. In a way that is open to interpretation, as all good art that imitates life is. If you know what I mean? Am I being too abstract? I can’t imagine keeping secrets, so I applaud you. On to the next question! One of my favorite “Doctor Who” fan theories claims that the Doctor always regenerates into a face he’s seen before. So, is there any chance the character of Bill is just one giant teaser for your eventual takeover as the Doctor? Would you turn down the role? What, would I turn down the role of Doctor Who? No, I’d be mad to do that, wouldn’t I? Can you imagine if someone was like, “Do you want to be Doctor Who?” And you were like, “Nah, I’m alright. One of the most exciting jobs in television? Nah, you can leave that, actually. I’m over it.” That’s not to say that’s what is going to happen. I mean, who knows?   There’s been loads of discussion about the all-male Doctor roster ― we’ve yet to see a woman tackle the role. What do you make of the show’s track record with representation?  I think in terms of representation, this series is doing pretty well from what I’ve seen so far. Hopefully, by the end of the series, we might have another conversation, or you might think the same. But in terms of playing the character of Doctor Who next, hopefully, they get whoever is best for the job, whatever gender or race that may be. You mentioned in a Guardian interview that you didn’t see many people who looked like you on TV growing up. When you think about your role on this show, are you thinking about the fans today who might still feel the same way you did? I think as an actress of color, there’s always that kind of responsibility. And especially in a prime-time, widely reaching show. For me, if even a couple of kids can look at Bill on “Doctor Who” and think, hey, she looks like me, maybe that means there’s more room for me in the world of acting or the world of television or the world of fighting aliens, then that’s a good thing, you know? I think it is important to see people that look like you and to show that there is a place for you in the world. That you do exist and that you are important. But then, that said, you know, I am only playing one person and she’s not supposed to be representative of every person and every young woman of color, because that would be a generalization that we wouldn’t want to make either. “Doctor Who” Season 10 premieres Saturday, April 15 at 9 p.m. ET on BBC America."
ARTS & CULTURE,"The Metropolitan Museum of Art will not remove a painting that an online petition claims “sexualizes” the image of a girl, said a museum official. Apparently inspired in part by the atmosphere of complaints about sexual harassment, New York City entrepreneur Mia Merrill launched the petition calling for the museum to remove the work, “Thérèse Dreaming,” because it presents the girl in a “sexually suggestive pose.” The 1938 painting by French artist Balthus shows a girl of 12 or 13 sitting in what seems to be a bedroom with her eyed closed and hands on her head. One of her legs is bent at the knee, with her foot resting on the chair. Her skirt has fallen open and her underwear is exposed. “‘Thérèse Dreaming’ is an evocative portrait of a prepubescent girl relaxing on a chair with her legs up and underwear exposed,” Mia Merrill wrote on the petition posted on the Care2 website on Thursday. “It is disturbing that the Met would proudly display such an image.” Given the “current climate around sexual assault and allegations that become more public each day, in showcasing this work for the masses, the Met is romanticizing voyeurism and the objectification of children,” Merrill added. The petition had more than 8,000 signatures Monday night. I put together a petition asking the Met to take down a piece of art that is undeniably romanticizing the sexualization of a child. If you are a part of the #metoo movement or ever think about the implications of art on life, please support this effort. https://t.co/gcCAFDe749 Museum spokesman Kenneth Weine said the Met would not remove the work and told the New York Post that “moments such as this provide an opportunity for conversation.” He added that the Met’s “mission is to collect, study, conserve, and present significant works of art across all times and cultures in order to connect people to creativity, knowledge and ideas.” The National Coalition Against Censorship issued a statement Monday supporting the museum’s decision. “Recent cases of censorship, including the threats of violence that forced the Guggenheim Museum in New York to remove several exhibits, reveal a disturbing trend of attempts to stifle art that engages difficult subjects,” said the NCAC statement. ” Art can often offer insights into difficult realities and, as such, merits vigorous defense.” Over 7500 New Yorkers have petitioned the #Met to remove this painting. The reason given was the “current climate around sexual assault.” The society has gone insane.This is one of the most stupid things I’ve heard in my life. A huge fan of his art. #Balthus #Art #NewYork pic.twitter.com/BOHg9Iu7tT Merrill said in the petition that Balthus had a “noted infatuation with pubescent girls” and called his work “pedophilic.” The painting features Thérèse Blanchard, a Paris neighbor of Balthus.  In an update to her petition Monday, Merrill said she would also consider her petition a success if the Met included a message with the painting “as brief as: “Some viewers find this piece offensive or disturbing, given Balthus’ artistic infatuation with young girls.”  It’s not the first time viewers have been disturbed by Balthus’ paintings. A review in The Guardian of an exhibit of Balthus’ works in 2013 at the Met, which included “Thérèse Dreaming,” noted the artist had an “inordinate fixation on girls who’d just hit puberty” and that the paintings had an “unsettling undertone” because of the “erotic images of children.” A sign at the start of the exhibit at the Met that year warned that “some of the paintings in this exhibition may be disturbing to some visitors.”"
POLITICS,"Cynthia Nixon may have secured only 5 percent of the vote in New York’s Democratic gubernatorial endorsement process, but her quest to unseat incumbent Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) presses on. “I am attending the convention today because New York Democrats deserve to have at least one actual Democrat running for governor at their state convention,” Nixon said Wednesday at the state’s Democratic Convention, admitting that she never expected to nail the 25 percent of votes needed to receive the party’s endorsement. “We are here to show we are not afraid, and this is our party too, and that voters have an alternative.” Cuomo won 95 percent of the vote, which according to Nixon’s team didn’t come as a shock.  The fact that Cuomo would snag the endorsement was “100 percent expected,” Nixon campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt told HuffPost. “Most people running for office will have to collect signatures to be on the ballot. It’s not seen as any significant hurdle.”  In New York state, the candidate endorsed by the party is the only person who doesn’t need to collect petition signatures in order to feature on the primary ballot. Nixon, she added, fully intends to snag the 15,000 petition signatures.  The “Sex and the City” star has positioned herself as an anti-establishment Democrat in a race against a politician who she says appeals more to Republicans than members of his own party. She’s attacked him for what she says is his failure to cater to the needs of many voters, hitting on minimal job creation and New York City’s decaying subway system.  New York has been “hungry” for a wider progressive vision, she said Wednesday on MSNBC’s “All In With Chris Hayes.”  Yet Cuomo does have the support of some of his party’s biggest names. Hillary Clinton endorsed Cuomo this week, saying Wednesday at the convention that the incumbent, who’s running for a third term, represents a leader “who will stand up for progressive values.” Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to speak on Thursday as Cuomo officially accepts the nomination.   This has been updated with comment from Hitt."

However, as AY sees it, this constant ambiguity stems from a place of complexity and a rejection of societal standards. “The world benefits from people being one thing or another,” AY told The Huffington Post. “Refusing to see things in a binary language is an act of resistance against the system.” AY first began thinking critically about ambivalence about five years ago, when she was studying feminist art in graduate school while working in fashion. The two fields’ divergent languages, especially in terms of feminine expression, left AY feeling stuck in between. At work, she was the “feminist killjoy,” she explained, and at school, she was the “fashion girl getting duped by the patriarchy.” Rather than choose between the fields, and adopt the identity that properly corresponded with the victor, AY opted to remain staunchly rooted somewhere in between. “I realized I was being defined in different ways depending on where I was,” she said. “I didn’t know how to situate myself. I decided to embrace both and neither, embrace my ambivalence as an active way of being.” For centuries in art, literature, real life and the imagination, the range of roles women could safely occupy was severely limited. Madonna and whore, mother and lover, beauty and hag. Today, though the categories have eased up a bit, women are still urged to choose fixed identities that make them legible to the outside world. Many today, for example, feel compelled to choose between feminist and feminine, unable to balance some radical tenants with more traditional ones. With her art practice, AY jams the circuit, imploring women to be complicated, unsure, messy and indeterminate. “In making our identities more complicated and not trying to fit into boxes,” she said, “that’s a powerful place to be.” AY’s drawings always begin with a sheet of sweet pink paper, the artist’s favorite color. In ballpoint pen and watercolor she draws young women with Margaret Keane-esque eyes and cotton-candy-colored hair, their bodies often warped to resemble mythical monsters that had recently given up on fitting in with the human race.  “My work has been evolving from something a bit cuter to something more grotesque,” AY said. “I’m interested in that juxtaposition between softness and this other ― almost creepy ― gross aesthetic.” The women’s indeterminate bodies mirrors their ambivalence within, their jumbled insides translating into appropriately hybrid physical forms. There is something wonderfully monstrous about a woman who refuses to fit into fixed categories.   Mostly, AY prefers to draw when she’s feeling kind of off, a feeling she described as “a weird state of kind of sad for not any particular reason.” This, too, illuminates what is possible when emotions, even glum ones, are translated into creative expression or activist resistance. She often leaves her drawings in public spaces for others to stumble upon, as subtle gestures of rebellion for the unknowing passersby. Along with the drawings, AY will also leave handwritten notes that confess contradictory feelings or opinions on subjects ranging from Tokyo to boobs. One reads: “Dear boobs, I love how you fill out a dress, I hate that you could be a ticking time bomb on my chest.” She documents her generous gestures on Tumblr, where she often waxes poetic about issues ranging from fashion to philosophy to colonialism.  It’s a very internet scenario, to see AY divulge so many personal details about her life online without ever revealing her identity. It’s her anonymity, the artist believes, that allows her to be so unabashed in her expression. “I was worried if I did this work as who I am I would censor myself too much,” she said.  It’s fun to imagine AY, without knowing her human form, as one of the lopsided ladies in her images, floating indeterminately from sketchbook to keyboard. It feels that her mystique puts her fans at ease, as well. They often share intimate details about their lives on Tumblr and avidly seek her advice. Yet because AY doesn’t feel qualified to give advice, she usually responds with a drawing.  AY’s mission has remained relatively constant since she started the project in 2011. It has always been political, she said, though not, perhaps, in an obvious way. “I tend to focus on the emotions and the small moments,” she explained. “My goal is to comfort people who are struggling, not to convince the people who are making us struggle.” Next time you wake up feeling weak but passionate, nervous but comfy, there’s no need to rush out of the muddle. Lie there for a minute or two and, bundled under the covers, begin to plot the feminist revolution. Know a story from your community of people fighting hate and supporting groups who need it?

ARTS & CULTURE,"A few months ago I had the privilege of introducing readers to a Japanese drum ensemble whose enduring sounds have performed for over thirty years and today counts 35 talented performers in its troupe. Kodo is credited with popularizing the Japanese drum taiko style around the world--their magic is in the group's ability to draw its audience into traditional Japanese sounds.  They spend most of their time during overseas and in Japan, and they recently wrapped up their North American tour, which took them all over the U.S. and Canada. When I followed back up with the group a few weeks ago, they told me how exciting it was to play in America's longest running performing arts theater, the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the thrill of performing to sold-out audiences in cities around the country. Here's what they had to say about One Earth Tour: Mystery's three-month stint inviting North American audiences to experience the sense of mystery in Japanese folk arts.  Steve Mariotti: How did One Earth Tour: Mystery do with North American audiences? Were any changes made in the process?
Kodo: Many changes have been made to Kodo's productions ever since we have welcomed in Kabuki actor, Tamasaburo Bando as our artistic director.  The theatrical and humorous pieces were internationally acclaimed, and audience of all ages were able to enjoy the performance. We have made a few minor changes to better reflect our North American audience tastes, and it has brought an addition of colorful expression on stage.  Namahage (credit: Takashi Okamoto) SM: What were the compositions featured in this tour and what are their significance?
Kodo: We had a few newly written pieces for this production which were all influenced by different art forms, culture, and music.  Kodo's compositions are written by the performing members, and our production in particular, Mystery, featured many of the traditional Japanese folk arts from all over the country. The serpent scene was Kodo's interpretation of Jamai (""serpent dance"") from Iwami Kagura in Shimane Prefecture.  There are other traditional Japanese performing arts incorporated into the production such as Shishimai and Namahage.  Other pieces in the production were written by the performers who get their influence from touring the world, and spending their time on Sado Island. SM: How did the group shape the timing and delivery for their audience? What did you need to understand about the audience to do that? How do you get to know an audience?
Kodo: As Mystery featured theatrical parts that brought a laugh to the audience, the ""ma"" was considered an important aspect of the performance.  ""Ma"" is a Japanese expression using a significant length of pause and silence.  ""Ma"" is used to create humor in theatrical scenes, and express tension in concentrated serious scenes.  This ""Ma"" is adjusted at every performance, based on what we learn throughout our audience feedback during tour.  The audience reactions are always very genuine; the length and timing of applauses, cheers, laughs, and the standing ovation after the finale, really reflects their feelings during the performance.  Chit Chat (credit: Takashi Okamoto) SM: What are Kodo's near future plans? What is the big vision for the future?
Kodo: In May of 2015, Kodo will perform in Osaka Japan in collaboration with Tamasaburo Bando for the musical production called Amaterasu.  In August, we will host our 28th annual international music festival called Earth Celebration here on our home soil on Sado Island.  In October, we will be in Montreal, Canada to be part of a contemporary ballet production called Kaguyahime.

After our performances of the production, Mystery, we will have our next new production called Eternity, touring domestically in Japan.  At the end of 2015, the newest production called Chaos will premier.  With the artistic direction of Tamasaburo Bando, Kodo will continuously aim for the highest quality performance, and present the audience with everlasting excitement of taiko music.    Shishimai (credit: Takashi Okamoto) Kodo will be back on U.S. soil in 2017, and you can see them in Europe next year."
ARTS & CULTURE,"In response to reports that President Donald Trump would like to slash national arts funding, artist Tega Brain has created a simple and effective website that celebrates the creative projects those plans threaten. Head to neafunded.us and you’ll find a scrolling list of art projects funded by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) in 2016 alone. From a playwriting competition in Atlanta, Georgia, to a poetry series in Kansas City, Missouri, to a film festival in Cleveland, Ohio, to music education in Las Vegas, Nevada, the seemingly never-ending scroll ― based on the latest NEA grant report ― highlights the kinds of endeavors states could lose if arts funding dies. Hearing that the National Endowment for the Arts is under threat, I made https://t.co/N5vQik81wW to show what they fund & where. #SavetheNEA In an email to The Huffington Post, Brain, an Australian-born, New York-based artist who specializes in “eccentric engineering,” explained that she created the website after learning that the current administration reportedly intends to close the NEA and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) amidst a larger push to slash government budgets. “It is an animated list of the incredibly wide range of arts projects and community arts organizations that receive some support through the NEA,” she wrote, noting that many of the highlighted projects on her website are not located in big urban cultural centers. “It is part of NEA’s mandate to support practices in all parts of the United States,” Brain added. “It’s well known in the art world that you’re more likely to get NEA support in remote places over city areas.” NEA funding, which makes up a fraction of one percent of the federal budget, is not only used to support artists, actors and musicians, but also producers, designers, lighting crews, cultural spaces and venues, catering companies, accountants and more, Brain reiterated. “Think about how many people you know whose job has something to do with the arts,” she said. “This is relevant to us all ... you can’t help but be struck by the range of different communities involved and by the dozens or more people that each of these small grants would benefit or employ.” According to The Independent, a White House petition to save arts funding is still not registering signatures. Only 97 signatures showed up as of the publication of this piece, and the link for reporting issues leads to an error page. When asked what advice she could offer to people who wish to get involved in advocating for or preserving the NEA, Brain replied: Do real activism. Bring people together who are concerned with this issue, or, connect with existing activist groups and initiatives who could become invested in this issue. If you are not sure how to do this, the Indivisible Guide or the Center for Artistic Activism webinar series on art and activism are good places to start. Eat together, talk and figure out ways to express dissent. Think of either the most powerful person in the arts who you know, or someone who is close to the NEA and get them onboard. Work with them to find ways to act that go beyond just being vocal on the internet. Disrupt and make this issue heard.  Check out an abbreviated list of projects featured on Brain’s website below. "

ARTS & CULTURE,"It’s difficult to talk about “The Handmaid’s Tale,” Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s famous dystopia, without bringing up the story’s eerie relevance to contemporary politics. It is, after all, centered on a dictatorial regime hellbent on policing women’s bodies. This was certainly the case during a panel discussion at Tribeca Film Festival on Friday night, during which many of the show’s cast and crew were asked how they felt about the political aspects of the series, set to premiere on April 26. When asked whether or not the story’s feminist themes in particular were part of the reason some of the actors were attracted to the project, the answers were somewhat surprising.  “Any story about a powerful woman owning herself in any way is automatically deemed feminist,” Madeline Brewer, who plays handmaid Janine, told audiences after a screening of the show’s first episode. “This is a story about a woman. I don’t think this is feminist propaganda. I think this is a story about women and about humans. The three people hanging on the wall were all men. This story affects all people.” “I really echo what Maddie said before,” Elisabeth Moss, who plays Offred, said. “It’s not a feminist story, it’s a human story, because women’s rights are human rights. I never intended to play Peggy [from ‘Mad Men’] as a feminist and I never expected to play Offred as a feminist.” A few members of the audience, including MTV culture writer Rachel Handler, took to Twitter to express their concern with Moss and Brewer’s claims. bizarre Handmaid's Tale panel at Tribeca. Cast stressing over and over again that it's ""not a feminist story, it's a human story."" exactly. I don't blame the cast, I blame whatever white male suit was like ""play down the feminist shit."" https://t.co/uRsg45IhT8 Watch the show y'all, it's v good. Just want Hulu's marketing dudes 2 get the message that feminism isn't a dirty word or a bad PR strategy. https://t.co/OGIQn2lGh8 In response, another Twitter user thought it wise to see what Atwood, the keeper of the source material, thought: .@MargaretAtwood Your thoughts? https://t.co/HRMFsXaQLC @KarmaLovesGumbo They needed an ""only,"" an ""also,"" and a human rights definition of the F word, imho. Atwood didn’t necessarily refute the cast’s claim, but rather edited it to be more in line with a human rights-centric definition of feminism, one that many contemporary feminists already adhere to. “It’s not only a feminist story,” she’d have them say, “it’s also a human story.” In an earlier essay for The New York Times titled “Margaret Atwood on What ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ Means in the Age of Trump,” the author weighed in on whether or not she considered her novel to be feminist. [I]s “The Handmaid’s Tale” a “feminist” novel? If you mean an ideological tract in which all women are angels and/or so victimized they are incapable of moral choice, no. If you mean a novel in which women are human beings — with all the variety of character and behavior that implies — and are also interesting and important, and what happens to them is crucial to the theme, structure and plot of the book, then yes. In that sense, many books are “feminist.” Moss has taken a similar position in past interviews. On stage on Friday, she described her character’s actions and thoughts as being motivated simply by a desire to survive and reunite with her daughter ― not necessarily a cemented vision of feminism. “For me, I don’t approach anything with a political agenda,” she added. “I approach it from a very human place, I hope.” While several members of the cast seemed less willing to discuss politics point blank during the Tribeca panel, Ann Dowd, who plays a complex villain in “Handmaid’s Tale,” did not mince words. When asked what kind of impact she’d like the show to have on viewers. “I hope it has a massive effect on people,” she said. “I hope they picket the White House and I hope they’re wearing [’Handmaid’s Tale’] costumes.” Her advice to fans who want to view “The Handmaid’s Tale” as a politically-charged warning was made clear: “Stay awake. Stay awake. And don’t for a minute think, well, I’ll get involved some other time. I won’t worry about the midterm election. I’ll just... no, no, no. Don’t wait. Just stay awake.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,"J. K. Rowling has apologized for erroneously accusing President Donald Trump of refusing to shake hands with a boy who uses a wheelchair. The Harry Potter writer criticized the president after viewing this footage of Trump seemingly refusing to shake the outstretched hand of 3-year-old Montgomery Weer after a speech on health care in the White House on July 24.  “How stunning, and how horrible, that Trump cannot bring himself to shake the hand of a small boy who only wanted to touch the president,” Rowling wrote in a series of blistering tweets on Friday. “My mother used a wheelchair. I witnessed people uncomfortable around her disability, but if they had a shred of decency they got over it,” she added. “So, yes, that clip of Trump looking deliberately over a disabled child’s head, ignoring his outstretched hand, has touched me on the raw.” But on Monday, the acclaimed author backtracked and admitted she’d actually only seen an edited version of the clip ― and had commented on it without knowing the full facts. The full version of the video, below, shows how Trump actually greeted the youngster, who has spina bifida, shortly after entering the room: After deleting her first set of tweets, Rowling posted a series of four messages in which she apologized to Weer and his family. “I very clearly projected my own sensitivities around the issue of disabled people being overlooked or ignored onto the images I saw and if that caused any distress to that boy or his family, I apologise unreservedly,” she wrote. She notably did not apologize to Trump himself, however ― who has previously caught heat for appearing to mock a reporter with disabilities. Check out the tweets here: Re: my tweets about the small boy in a wheelchair whose proferred hand the president appeared to ignore in press footage, multiple /1 sources have informed me that that was not a full or accurate representation of their interaction.

ARTS & CULTURE," By Ann Binlot, March 10, 2015 Ron Arad may be known for the products he's designed in the past five decades, like the sleek Tom Vac chair he designed for Vitra in 1999 or the winding Bookworm shelf he created for Kartell in 1994, but in recent years the industrial designer has been exploring his artistic side. After making its debut at the Design Museum Holon, Arad's art exhibition ""In Reverse"" recently opened at Paul Kasmin Gallery's 27th Street location. On view through March 14, the exhibition features six of Arad's ""Pressed Flower"" sculptures -- a Fiat 500, a car that is illegal in the United States, pressed flat with a giant press. Arad decided to focus on the Fiat 500 because of his history with the vehicle. The Fiat Topolino 500c Giardiniera was his family's first car, and his father almost died in it when he was young. Arad still even owns one today. ""I have a personal history with the 500, and also this car is a very special car in the history of the car industry because I think it's the smallest car that has the necessary conditions that qualify it to be a car,"" said Arad. ""You make it smaller, it's not a car, you make it bigger, it's not the smallest car. It's an Italian icon."" Just don't assume that Arad simply flattened the cars. ""I decided to take it from being a three-dimensional object to a two-dimensional object, and I decide to immortalize it because that way it will stay forever,"" said the designer-cum-artist. Arad procured the cars from a family in London. ""They looked after my Fiat, and I told them what I want to do, and in the beginning they were very sad, but I explained to them I'm immortalizing it, they helped me with the project, and they prepared them for me, and took the engines out,"" he said. Along with the six pressed Fiat 500s, the exhibition also features ""Blame the Tools,"" a life-sized steel and bronze sculpture that's a digitally gridded 3D model of a Fiat. How does making art differ from industrial design? ""The process is not all that different,"" said Arad. ""The circumstances, the atmosphere, how it's used, how it showed, but sometimes the process is very similar. The thought might be different."" ""In Reverse"" by Ron Arad will be on display at Paul Kasmin Gallery through March 14. --Ann Binlot is contributor to ARTPHAIRE.

ENTERTAINMENT,"Can you keep up, baby boy? Apparently so. Days after the history-making Destiny’s Child reunion at Coachella, Michelle Williams announced she’s engaged to boyfriend Chad Johnson.  The singer revealed on Thursday that Johnson, a pastor and life coach, popped the question nearly a month before she took the stage with former bandmates Beyoncé and Kelly Rowland. “We do wanna get married very, very soon,” she exclusively told People about her upcoming nuptials. “We’ve been moving very quickly and planning. Why wait? I want to get married now, but he wants a wedding!” A post shared by Michelle Williams (@michellewilliams) on Apr 19, 2018 at 9:40am PDT And because, of course, everyone is wondering about the guest list, Williams has every intention of including her fellow independent women.  “We’re wanting all of our friends and family to be there. So it’s looking good!” she told the outlet.   The couple first crossed paths in March 2017 at one of Johnson’s spiritual retreats when Williams was in a “horrible, dark place” following a bad breakup. As a guest host on the talk show “The Real,” she’d previously opened up about discovering her boyfriend was cheating via social media.  “When we met, both of us were in very similar places on a personal level,” Johnson explained. “Michelle was coming off the heels of a really bad relationship, and I was just in a place of despair as well.” The two clicked from the beginning, but didn’t start a romantic relationship until after the retreat, texting, FaceTiming and talking on the phone for months before ever meeting again in person.  A post shared by Michelle Williams (@michellewilliams) on Apr 17, 2018 at 2:36pm PDT “What kept drawing me and drawing me at first was I felt like I could be myself,” said Williams. “My first name is Tenitra; my middle name is Michelle. I felt like I could be Tenitra: just ratchet, I didn’t have to have on any makeup, if I had to have on my hair bonnet — he just made me feel very safe in being myself.” So, when Johnson asked to marry her with a proposal video showing him asking for her family’s blessing, she said yes.  “I’ve waited yeeeeeeears for someone who could come in to my world and be CONFIDENT and NOT insecure, love who I love and genuinely be there for people,” she captioned a photo of her fiancé after the Coachella performance. “I LOVE YOU.” Destiny fulfilled!

BUSINESS," Last week’s column addressed “What Older Employees Can Learn From Young Executives.” Granted, all five characteristics represent generalizations and aren’t universally applicable. But as generalizations, they guide thinking toward positive expectations.  The same can be said about what younger managers can learn from older employees. Stereotypical thinking, for sure. Nevertheless, the following traits are common in older employees—and well worth considering. What Young Managers Learn From Older Employees: 4 Attitudes Humility Traditionalists and Boomers were taught to let others do the bragging. When they’ve earned the gold watch after 40 years or built their entrepreneurial venture, they take a bow modestly. When faced with competition or conflict, they embrace Frank Sinatra’s observation, “The best revenge is massive success.” The evidence of humility? Grandparents don’t mind having their grandkids teach them all about their smart phone, program their TV’s remote control, or rewire their sound system. The 60-something CEO will ask the savvy teen next door to build him a website for his hobby and teach him how to log in to update it. The seasoned executive may select an oncologist who has just finished her residency to ensure she’s getting someone familiar with the very latest research and techniques for treatment.  Older employees have lived long enough to know what they don’t know—and be humbled by that knowledge. Solid Sense of Self Older employees have a strong sense of self and personal satisfaction about their place and purpose in the world. Although most are still striving to learn, grow, do, and achieve, they do not need constant direction and feedback from others about their work. They have developed their own standards of good, better, and best.  They are their own worst critic and coach. While praise and reward is always welcome, they work for the self-satisfaction of a job well done. Loyalty When you invest in something, you’re committed to the cause. Take politics, for example. If you vote for someone, you invest in them emotionally and want them to succeed. If you invest in a charity, you want to see that your dollars are well spent and actually help people. If you invest your time in training, you want to be able to use the skills or expertise on the job. The same is true when investing in people. When you’ve worked with an individual, a team, or an organization for a long time, you’re committed to them. Simply by reason of longevity, older employees have either engaged enough to feel loyalty—or have felt the pain of betrayal and disloyalty from either a family member, a colleague, or an organization.  Both feelings—the engagement of loyalty and the pain of betrayal––produce a positive outcome for the long-term. Older employees have a strong sense of loyalty. In tough times, they “have each other’s back.” Gratitude For the most part, older employees do not feel entitled to a paycheck or constant attention. They’ve lived through recessions, oil busts, the dot.com bubble, natural disasters, and personal tragedies. They’re grateful for the opportunity to work, hold a job, build a business, invest, or pursue their dream—whatever that may be. Whether you’re a younger manager with a team of older workers or an older employee with a young executive as boss, there are great qualities in each generation worth observing and emulating.  The essence of leadership is the ability to communicate with people of all ages at all levels in the organization to help them perform at their best.

BUSINESS,"Randi Zuckerberg, founder of Zuckerberg Media and sister of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is accusing Alaska Airlines staff of enabling a drunk first-class passenger to continue harassing her during a three-hour flight, even after she asked for help. Zuckerberg aired her grievances with the airline on Twitter, sharing the email she sent to Alaska Air’s corporate staff. Her email prompted the company to launch a full investigation into the encounter, company spokeswoman Bobbie Egan told HuffPost in an email. “Feeling disgusted & degraded,” the former Facebook marketing director tweeted. In her note to the company, Zuckerberg claimed the passenger made offensive sexual comments to her as soon as she took her seat next to him in first class ― and said that staff asked her to excuse his behavior because he was a frequent flyer. She wrote: “He started talking to me about touching himself, kept asking me if I fantasized about the female business colleague I was traveling with, rated and commented on the women’s bodies boarding the aircraft as they walked by us, and many more equally horrifying and offensive comments.” Feeling disgusted & degraded after an @AlaskaAir flight where the passenger next to me made repeated lewd sexual remarks. The flight attendants told me he was a frequent flier, brushed off his behavior & kept giving him drinks. I guess his $ means more than our safety? My letter: pic.twitter.com/xOkDpb0dYU After raising the issue with staff on the plane, Zuckerberg said flight attendants suggested she not take the man’s behavior personally, saying they were used to it because he traveled regularly on their route from Los Angeles to Mazatlan, Mexico. “They have had to talk to him about his behavior in the past, but oh well don’t take it personally, this guy just doesn’t have a filter,” Zuckerberg recalled the staff as saying. Asked whether Alaska Air staff is more lenient with problematic frequent flyer customers, Egan told HuffPost: “Absolutely not.” Zuckerberg said the flight attendants offered to move her to a middle seat at the back of the plane after she told them she was “extremely uncomfortable.” She rejected their offer. “I am furious at that passenger for making me extremely uncomfortable for a 3 hour flight,” she wrote in the email. “But I am even more furious with Alaska Airlines for knowingly and willingly providing this man with a platform to harass women.” Zuckerberg claimed staff joked with the passenger by asking him “Are you behaving today?” and continued to serve him alcoholic beverage throughout the flight, as he continued to bombard her with sexual comments. “Ironically one of those comments was about all the recent sexual harassment cases in the media and how ‘these Millennial women just aren’t willing to give some booty to get a job anymore,’” Zuckerberg recalled, referencing the recent outings of powerful men who’ve been accused of sexual assault. UPDATE: I just got off the phone with two executives from @AlaskaAir who informed me that they are conducting an investigation and have temporarily suspended this passenger’s travel privileges. Thank you for taking this seriously. Less than two hours after tweeting out the email, Zuckerberg said two company executives reached out to her to say they’d launched an investigation into the incident and temporarily suspended the unnamed passenger’s travel privileges. “What Randi Zuckerberg shared with us is very disturbing,” Egan told HuffPost, adding that the company will take “appropriate steps, as needed,” pending results of the investigation.  “We want our guests to feel safe,” Egan said. “As a company, we have zero tolerance for any type of sexual misconduct that creates an unsafe environment for our guests and crew members.” Members of Alaska Airlines’ loyalty program enjoy perks including free first-class upgrades, complimentary drinks and priority boarding. This story has been updated to include a response from Alaska Airlines."
ARTS & CULTURE," Think of the most moving photograph you know. Maybe it’s that iconic image of a soldier greeting his beau -- maybe you had it in poster form on your college dorm room wall. Maybe you’re more like Barthes, for whom the best photo he could think of was a family heirloom -- an image of his mother before he even knew her, as a gleeful child, but still possessing the qualities of the woman he would come to love.  For decades, the art world had a tendency to believe that black-and-white images were somehow more powerful -- more moving, and more artistic as the lack of color nods to the unrealistic construction of the image. Of course, that notion has long since expired, and color has proliferated picture frames, magazines and Instagram feeds. The use of neon hues is no longer seen as an act of rebellion, even within gallery walls. So what does color mean today, now that it's no longer a subversive opposition to the norm? Humble Arts Foundation Curator Jon Feinstein attempts to answer these questions in ""Radical Color,"" an exhibition at the Newspace Center for Photography in Portland, Oregon. ""With the majority of photography being digital now, it's in a stage in which it's more of a fiction than ever before. We assume that everything is manipulated, retouched, staged, or untrue in some form, and realizing that isn't even a new idea,"" Feinstein told The Huffington Post. ""With that, and the understanding that color is no longer a more accurate hue for describing reality than black and white, we're in a period in which photographers can run with that fiction and push its limitations in continuously exciting ways."" His exhibit features work like that of Christopher Rodriguez, who playfully explores vibrant shades, and the more cerebral Hollis Johnson, whose images directly confront color as a subject. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"
Painting the Sea of Galilee I have always traveled with my paints and sketchbook and was fortunate to live in Europe while the recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship, and then later in Asia as the awardee of a grant from The Henry Luce Foundation. I have books filled with my European and Asian travel drawings and watercolors.  Some of them became illustrations for magazines such as The New Yorker, Gourmet, and the New York Times.  I continued the tradition of traveling with my paints during a recent trip to Israel, returning to places I had painted years ago such as Jerusalem, Masada and the Sea of Galilee. I went to new places such as Jaffa and Akko and En Gedi.  I sat on steps, in alleyways and, if I was fortunate, on a terrace or table where I could set up my supplies.     Painting in Jaffa One of my favorite places to go was to the old city of Jaffa.  I would put my supplies in my bicycle basket and ride down the coast past the surfers and sunbathers of Tel Aviv Beach to the old city. I also visited Akko and ended up painting the small square in front of the Greek Orthodox Church.  Akko What I find unique about painting on site is that I can observe and learn about a culture -- not only am I painting, but I am listening to the conversations and observing while also interacting directly with my subject.  The downside, at least on this trip were ants, flies, cats and rain. Years ago I spent time in Jerusalem drawing and painting the city and the rooftops, I again returned to paint the city.  I paid five shekels at the Petra Hostel (where President Grant once stayed in it's better days) and went to the roof for a great view of the city.  I also discovered the view from the King David Hotel, considered the grande dame of Jerusalem hotels.  If you are fortunate enough to stay there the views of the old city are spectacular.  The King David's terrace was another great place to paint the exterior city with beautiful views of the city wall away from the hustle and bustle (and also affords a delicious lunch, I recommend the pumpkin soup.) Be sure to wear comfortable shoes while walking around the old city. Another favorite place to paint was the Sea of Galilee. I climbed up to Mt. Arbel (a short drive from Tiberius, it is a national park) and there are some great vistas looking down from the cliffs.  I spent time painting at the Scots Hotel, an idyllic setting with a beautiful tiered garden and a selection of trees and flowers tailored for the Botanist. The Scots Hotel was established by the Scottish Church in 2004 in the historic 19th century compound of the Scottish Hospital.  It is a great base to explore the area and to paint -- I found myself at the top of the old hospital building looking out on the Sea of Galilee through the arches for a final painting.  I have been very involved with the U.S. State Department's Art in Embassies program and my paintings have been on exhibit at the U.S. Embassy Residences in Paris, Madrid, Prague, Oslo and in Eastern Europe and Africa.  I currently have a painting on exhibit at the U.S. Embassy in Hong Kong, so I was particularly pleased to see the exhibit at the U.S. Embassy Residence in Tel Aviv.  I took a break from painting in Tel Aviv to visit the exhibit 'Childhood' there.  I returned to The Dead Sea and Masada and would get out by  6:30 to paint the sunrise and the shadows cutting the mountains with the turquoise water foreground before it rained. The weather changed dramatically and the wind was so fierce it knocked over my water onto my paints and blew my chair away into the Dead Sea.  I can only imagine the severity of dust storms.    The Dead Sea In the afternoon I went to Masada which is quite extraordinary (my second visit and the frescos and mosaics from Herod's palace were just as fresh as I remembered).  I was painting at Masada when it once more started to pour, which  reminded me again of the obstacles of plein air watercolors. The benefits, however, outweigh the obstacles It is a direct response to the place and  etches in my mind unique images as I am intently looking and not just taking a quick photo and moving on. Years ago, when I was a teaching assistant at Harvard University I took a class at Harvard College, The History of the Jews with Professor Twersky.  His teaching assistant and I became friends and he purchased one of my line drawings of the roofs of Jerusalem to give to his wife (this was the time period I was doing New Yorker drawings).  He took the art with him to Jerusalem where he now lives so although I've left, some of my art is still there.  Jaffa Square "
BUSINESS,"I’ve written about tax-related crime for years, and have always offered this fail-safe rule to avoid tax scams: If you ever receive a call from the IRS about back taxes or any other money you supposedly owe the government, hang up because it’s a scam. There was something comforting about that advice — maybe even a little satisfying. I mean, who secretly doesn’t want to hang up on the taxman? But it seemed no amount of repetition was enough to stem the tide of tax-related scams, and no matter how many times I wrote about that simple, satisfying tactic, the message never reached the people most vulnerable to such shenanigans. Taxpayers still got taken in by scam artists dialing for dollars every day. It didn’t matter if the crook posed as an IRS employee, or if he ventured into the truly absurd with a claim that he worked for a collection agency that bought back tax debt from the agency. It was wacky stuff, the IRS selling debt. But it was wackier than that … All you had to know was this: The IRS did all its own collecting, and it conducted all its business via snail mail. It never called. The advice was solid: Let your spirit fly! Do or say whatever you want when the IRS called about back taxes or an audit because it wasn’t them! You know where I’m going with this, right? Yep, leave it to our friends in Washington to take a bad situation and make it worse. Earlier this month, IRS chief John Koskinen announced that the IRS would be immediately outsourcing certain debt collection activities to one of four debt collection companies: CBE Group of Cedar Falls, Iowa; Conserve of Fairport, New York; Performant of Livermore, California; and Pioneer of Horseheads, New York. You read that right. The IRS is outsourcing debt to collection agencies. When this was initially announced last September, I was convinced that it was a joke—and a pretty good one. Extra points for coming up with something more or less unthinkable— since truly, debt collection agencies could not be a more problematic solution to the IRS’s back tax problem — but it turns out it wasn’t their joke. You can thank Congress for this epic face palm. Although it didn’t get much attention when it passed in 2015, one of the provisions of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act required the IRS to hire private-sector debt collectors to pay for it. Since consumers are going to have to handle this year’s post-tax season a little different as a result, here are some telltale giveaways that you’re getting scammed and should hang up: You get a call from a collection agency not listed above. Only those four agencies are approved for these collections. You do not owe back taxes. The person calling you has asked you to send money somewhere other than the IRS. Even though the four collection agencies are making the call, the check goes to the Fed. The caller asks you to pay in the form of gift cards, prepaid cards or asks you to wire funds. The caller is aggressive or rude — a violation of your debt-collection rights. You are asked for any information that can be used to conduct a financial transaction: Social Security number, bank account, credit or debit card number. (If you do turn over personal information, keep an eye on your credit for signs of identity theft. You can view your free credit report summary on Credit.com.) If you are low-income, there may be other options for you. Contact the IRS to find out what they may be before discussing your debt with a collection agency. By now we’ve gotten pretty good at surviving the ridiculous decisions made on Capitol Hill, but this latest one is a doozy. Happily, my old advice still stands. If you get a call from a debt collector, don’t engage until you verify the debt. If it was a legit collector, they’ll furnish written verification within five days of calling you, and here’s what to do when that happens."

POLITICS,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions used his office’s vast power over immigration courts on Thursday to curb immigration judges’ authority to administratively close cases. The order could dramatically increase the already record-high backlog that immigration courts are experiencing and encourage judges to issue swift removal orders for immigrants, even if they have a case to stay in the United States. Sessions forced the policy change by using the attorney general’s exceptional authority to overrule decisions of immigration judges ― an authority restricted to that type of court. The case Sessions announced on Thursday is one of three he referred to himself, and the first to be decided. All three cases could have far-reaching consequences for the immigration system, raising fears among immigrant rights advocates that Sessions will use the approach to further the Trump administration’s efforts to maximize deportations. Thursday’s case concerns an immigrant, referred to as Castro-Tum, who entered the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor and whose case was closed by a judge after he failed to appear at multiple court hearings. Using the case to make a broad opinion not just on this decision, but those of immigration judges overall, Sessions argued that immigration judges were overstepping their authority by granting administrative closure, which doesn’t give an individual relief from deportation but pauses their case. Judges often use these closures when an immigrant has another application for relief pending; for example, if someone is in removal proceedings but waiting to be approved for a visa from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or if someone is appealing a criminal conviction that, if overturned, could affect their immigration case. Now, judges will be limited in their ability to close cases as those other processes move forward ― and sometimes drag on. This could lead them to order removals for immigrants who are still waiting for visa approval or other relief, attorneys warned. “It’s the epitome of bad docketing practice to take a whole group of cases, thousands of cases, that could be resolved by another agency and have them just sit and linger in court,” said Jeremy McKinney, national secretary for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “Or worse than that, to deport people who are trying to go through the immigration system the right way.” Sessions has given plenty of indications he disapproves of these types of case closures, and especially the frequency with which they were used under former President Barack Obama. From October 2011 through September 2017, judges closed more than 215,00 cases, which was about three-quarters of the number closed in a 31-year span before 2011, according to the Department of Justice. The attorney general proclaimed in December that under Trump, DOJ was “completing, not closing, immigration cases,” and earlier this year, the agency began to set quotas for how many cases judges must clear each year. Sessions has also called for restrictions that would allow more removals of immigrants who came to the U.S. as unaccompanied minors, as Castro-Tum did.  Based on the attorney general’s statements, the American Immigration Council and other groups have filed a brief arguing Sessions was unfit to be a neutral arbiter of the case. “We know he is part of Trump’s political agenda to rush cases through the system,” Trina Realmuto, directing attorney of the Boston office of the American Immigration Council, said on Thursday. “But as the attorney general, as the head of the Department of Justice, as the person who is certifying immigration cases to himself, he needs to be neutral, impartial and he needs to adjudicate without a political agenda.” Sessions did not heed their call to recuse himself, and his eventual opinion was exactly what immigrant rights advocates feared: a decision that limits the discretion of judges to determine how to operate their own dockets, potentially at the expense of immigrants. Now, judges will only be able to administratively close cases if there is a specific regulation or settlement that authorizes them to do so. To avoid overwhelming the courts, Sessions ordered that cases would not be put back on the calendar until the Department of Homeland Security or the immigrant respondent in each case request to do so. Sessions wrote that judges can issue continuances postponing court proceedings rather than closing cases if they’re waiting on other pending matters. But he is weighing a separate case that could limit judges’ ability to issue such continuances. Sessions’ moves to limit judges’ abilities to pause cases could lead to a spike in removal orders for people with legitimate claims for relief, said McKinney from the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Not that attorneys wouldn’t fight it ― McKinney said lawyers would almost certainly appeal if a client waiting on a visa approval was ordered removed, or seek relief that the judge has authority to grant, such as asylum. But Sessions may be moving to make that tougher, too ― asylum is the topic of the third case he referred to himself for a potential far-reaching decision."

ENTERTAINMENT,"Harvey Weinstein appeared in court Friday on three charges related to a monthslong sex crime investigation led by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. Weinstein surrendered himself to the New York Police Department that morning. Prosecutors charged the disgraced Hollywood producer with two rape charges, one first-degree and one third-degree, and one criminal sexual act in the first degree. The alleged incidents occurred against two women in 2013 and 2004, respectively. Weinstein’s bail was set at $1 million, with a $10 million bond alternative.  Prosecutors said he will be fitted with a tracking device and must seek the court’s approval if he wishes to leave New York or Connecticut. He has surrendered his passport. “Today’s charges reflect significant progress in this active, ongoing investigation,” District Attorney Cyrus Vance said in a statement. “I thank the brave survivors who have come forward, and my Office’s prosecutors who have worked tirelessly on this investigation.” Weinstein is expected to plead not guilty. A lawyer for the former producer told reporters his team believes “that at the end of the process,” his client “will be exonerated.” Weinstein’s arrest comes more than seven months after damning initial reports in The New York Times and The New Yorker prompted dozens of women to come forward accusing him of various forms of sexual misconduct. Some thought the day would never come when he would face prosecution. Reporters for the Times and The New Yorker ― Jodi Kantor, Megan Twohey and Ronan Farrow ― received the Pulitzer Prize for public service earlier this year for their work. They, along with the women who shared their stories, are credited with sparking the Me Too and Time’s Up movements against sexual misconduct that have affected innumerable other, less high-profile industries. We’re in the courtroom waiting for Weinstein. For so long he had his own private system— fancy lawyers who paid to silence women, private investigators and spies. Now he answers to the same system as the rest of us. pic.twitter.com/ajxYCwhATw After surrendering, Weinstein was taken to court in handcuffs Friday morning to face the charges, The Associated Press reported. The investigation is still ongoing. Weinstein’s next court appearance is scheduled for July 30. The NYPD said in a statement that Weinstein was charged with “rape, criminal sex act, sex abuse, and sexual misconduct for incidents involving two separate women.”  One of the women is reportedly Lucia Evans, who told The New Yorker the disgraced Hollywood producer invited her to a meeting about work opportunities in 2004. He then allegedly forced her to perform oral sex. “I said, over and over, ‘I don’t want to do this, stop, don’t,’” Evans told the outlet. “I tried to get away, but maybe I didn’t try hard enough. I didn’t want to kick him or fight him.” Eventually, she said, “He’s a big guy. He overpowered me.” An unnamed law enforcement official told The Associated Press that the other woman has not spoken publicly. Prosecutors say Weinstein kept her “physically against her will” in a Manhattan DoubleTree hotel room, where he raped her in March 2013. She will reportedly remain anonymous throughout the proceedings.  A culture of abuse in Hollywood enabled Weinstein’s alleged abuse to become an open secret in the industry, where the producer himself enjoyed all the perks of stardom. He was said to hold the power to make or break a career.  One woman, a Netflix producer, said in a recent lawsuit against him that she could recall 11 separate incidents in which he sexually abused her. Robert Boyce, now-retired chief of detectives for New York City, said in March that his department had gathered “quite a bit of evidence” against Weinstein, The Guardian reported.    As part of its investigation, the NYPD also examined the alleged 2010 sexual assault of “Boardwalk Empire” actress Paz de la Huerta, The Wall Street Journal reported.  De la Huerta told Vanity Fair that Weinstein sexually assaulted her twice. Both incidents allegedly occurred at her Manhattan apartment. The second time, the actress said she had been drinking and recalled feeling afraid of the producer, who had been repeatedly calling her since the first rape. “I did say no, and when he was on top of me I said, ‘I don’t want to do this.’ He kept humping me and it was disgusting. He’s like a pig,” she told Vanity Fair. Weinstein, meanwhile, has continually denied engaging in any nonconsensual sex acts. In 2015, New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. let Weinstein off the hook for an alleged sexual assault by an Italian model, deciding there was insufficient evidence to charge Weinstein for allegedly groping her. In March, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) ordered the state attorney general to review the decision, which Vance has defended. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are also reportedly investigating Weinstein, as are authorities in Los Angeles and London. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York had opened a sex crime investigation to examine whether the producer lured any women across state lines to commit a sex crime.  Weinstein reportedly tried to silence many of his accusers by hiring private investigators to dig up information on the women and journalists aware of his alleged misconduct.  As ugly stories about his behavior continued stacking up last year, he checked into a rehabilitation facility in Scottsdale, Arizona, late last year. Weinstein was fired from the studio he co-founded, The Weinstein Company, in October. He has also been expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Producers Guild of America and the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. The District Attorney’s office urges additional survivors with relevant information about Weinstein to contact the city’s Sex Crimes Hotline at 212-335-9373. This article has been updated with more details."
ARTS & CULTURE,"A few years ago, Brazilian-born writer, actor and dancer Andrea Dantas heard back about her audition to dance flamenco on Madonna’s world tour. She didn’t get the job.  “I thought, ‘OK, you’re allowed to feel sorry for yourself for 10 minutes,’” Dantas told The Huffington Post. “After, I thought, ‘What do you want to do now? What do you want to do with your life?’ And I swear, I heard a voice that said ‘Frida,’ and I just knew.” The fruits of Dantas’ labor are currently on view at Brooklyn’s BAM Fisher, in a one-woman show called “Fragmented Frida.” Dantas plays the role of the iconic painter Frida Kahlo, starting as a young, awkward yet precocious child ― complete with a bowl cut and a limp ― and ending up as the most renowned woman artist of all time: braided hair, unibrow and all. Far more than Dantas focuses on the specifics of Kahlo’s artistic craft, she zooms in on her life story, an extraordinary journey riddled with hardship. At the age of 6, Kahlo was stricken with polio, leaving her right leg incapacitated and in tremendous pain. At 18 she was involved in a near-fatal bus crash, which left her pelvis crushed. While recovering, and spending most of her time in a wheelchair, Kahlo began to paint, famously declaring: “I don’t paint dreams or nightmares, I paint my own reality.” It was Kahlo’s incredible resilience that drew Dantas to her as a character. “At that time in Mexico, being a woman wasn’t cool, being a feminist wasn’t cool, divorcing a man wasn’t cool, being a bisexual wasn’t cool, being so free sexually was not cool at all,” Dantas said. “How did she manage to do so much in spite of all the illness and all the betrayals? How does the underdog become the hero?” Dantas read around 20 Kahlo biographies before writing the script, taking about eight months to research. She then trained with movement coach Thiago Felix to accurately convey how Kahlo moved through the world, crippled at various points by illness, injury and heartbreak. Even after receiving recognition for her dreamlike self-portraits, which translated her brutal physical and emotional wounds onto her painted flesh, Kahlo continued to suffer. After being told she could not conceive, she became pregnant, only to suffer a grisly miscarriage. She experienced infidelity on the part of her husband, painter Diego Rivera, most painfully with her own sister.  While today Kahlo is regarded as a figure of strength and courage, it was important for Dantas to capture the softer, more vulnerable aspects of her personality to show how, despite the mythical status she achieved, she was an emotional, fallible human being. “She had such a subtlety to her and a magnetism, she was a hopeless romantic,” Dantas said. “She was soft, she had a great sense of humor. It’s not just about the pain and the suffering. She was not a victim. This is a woman who, when her leg was amputated, the first thing she did was custom-make a boot for herself. She painted it red so everyone could see what was happening to her. She had an amazing zest for life.” Although Dantas could not have predicted the political climate in which her play would debut, the current moment seems to make its message all the more pressing. “In the 1930s Frida said: ‘If the American people rebelled against everything that is wrong here, this would be a very different place,’” Dantas said. “Even then, she always said that women matter, that the LGBTQ community matters, that art matters. All the craziness that is happening in the country regarding immigration, she would have a lot to say about that for sure.”  There have already been countless retrospectives, books, essays and films devoted to the life of Ms. Kahlo. Through “Fragmented Frida,” Dantas hopes to add her own perspective to the mix with a performance revolving around one particular thread of Kahlo’s many accomplishments: Her exceptional ability to turn vulnerability into strength. “She overcame so much,” Dantas said. “She shows, with certainty, there is nothing a person cannot overcome.” “Fragmented Frida,” directed by Christine Renee Miller, runs until Sunday, April 16, at BAM Fisher in Brooklyn, New York. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"In Spring 2001, I met director Scott Schwartz at the opening night party of Bat Boy. It was in the middle of a huge time for him -- months before he had made his Broadway directorial debut, co-directing Jane Eyre; tick... tick... BOOM! was coming up. In the next couple of years, he was a New York fixture. Then he went away, making only a handful of returns to the New York City stage in the next decade (most recently with the acclaimed two-hander Murder for Two). Now he's somewhat close to Broadway again with another high-profile work, the stage adaptation of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. ""I did three musicals in New York and really wanted to take some time to focus on doing other things,"" Schwartz said about his time away. ""I love musicals -- they're my first love -- but, as a director, I wanted to expand my range and broaden my base of work."" He did that by directing a ton of different types of pieces at regional theaters.  Then, at some point, Disney called. The call wasn't about Hunchback specifically, it was more a general chat about projects. But soon thereafter the talks focused on Hunchback. Inspired by the classic Victor Hugo novel, The Hunchback of Notre Dame has a book by Peter Parnell, music by Alan Menken and lyrics by Scott Schwartz's dad, Stephen Schwartz. The father/son combo have not worked together that much over the years, which the junior Schwartz said is by design. But this one called to him. ""The show is very different than the animated movie and people should know that coming in,"" Schwartz said. ""One of the very early decisions we made was that this should be a show for adults and a show that really goes back to Victor Hugo, both the story and tone. We weren't going to make this a family musical. There is a lot of new music. There is some music that was cut from the film. The show is substantially darker."" This is not the first attempt to bring this story to the stage. Well-known librettist/director James Lapine wrote the book for and directed a different stage musical version Der Glockner von Notre Dame, which opened in Germany in 1999. Disney has been mum on why Lapine is not working on the American version, and Schwartz claimed to not know what led to the decision. Schwartz, who did not see the show in Germany, did say he has been in contact with Lapine, who has been helpful in this version's development.  The Schwartz version began its life at La Jolla Playhouse this fall and is now playing at Paper Mill Playhouse through April 5. ""The physical production is quite simple,"" Schwartz stated. ""We wanted to strip away as much artifice as possible in the show -- everything is based on classic theatrical techniques.  They use the raw materials of the cathedral to realize the storytelling."" The show does have a giant set, but it doesn't change much. The actors move around the set pieces when needed. Michael Arden transforms into the titular character before your eyes.   According to Schwartz, the real goal was to use the score from the Disney musical movie and combine it with Victor Hugo's original, much darker, novel. He believes they've accomplished that. Each song has had work done to it and some of the lighter ones were cut altogether. The show is now complete with a parental advisory. It is unclear what the future holds for this Hunchback. Another Disney project, Newsies, went from Paper Mill to Broadway not so long ago. The same could happen for Hunchback, but then it could not. For his part, Schwartz is just enjoying the ride. His production of Murder for Two is currently enjoying a regional tour. He is also artistic director of the Bay Street Theatre, which he is trying to make a home for new works. And Hunchback, regardless of its future, has been a great experience for him. ""The idea was really to focus on the humanity of the piece,"" he said. ""Being focused on that, making sure we used theatrical techniques to make that happen, has been a joy."" Photos by Matthew Murphy."
POLITICS,"Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who recently joined President Donald Trump’s legal team, sat down with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos on Sunday for a wide-ranging, eyebrow-raising interview. Giuliani appeared on ABC’s “This Week” following his explosive revelation on Fox News last week that Trump had reimbursed Michael Cohen, the president’s personal attorney, for the $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump, who had previously denied all knowledge of the payment, suggested Friday that Giuliani didn’t have “his facts straight.” Giuliani quickly backpedaled, saying during a Fox News appearance on Saturday that he was “still learning” about the case. On Sunday, he continued to sow confusion about what he knows. Here were some of the biggest takeaways from his ABC interview: “We don’t have to,” Giuliani said when asked if Trump would comply. “He’s the president of the United States. We can assert the same privileges other presidents have.” Mueller reportedly warned Trump’s lawyers in March that he had the power to issue a subpoena if the White House refused his request to have a sit-down interview with the president as part of the federal investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, rejected that argument on CNN later Sunday. “He’s going to need to comply with a subpoena,” he told the network’s Jake Tapper. “If they take that case to court, they’re going to lose.” Pres. Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani tells @GStephanopoulos “we don’t have to” comply with a potential subpoena from the special counsel, adding “He's the President of the United States. We can assert the same privileges other presidents have.” https://t.co/R6JsMQN9yM pic.twitter.com/RX6MLYeQ2e “Every lawyer in America thinks he would be a fool to testify,” Giuliani said. “I’ve got a client who wants to testify. ... I hope we get a chance to tell him the risk that he’s taking.” Giuliani also said he expects Cohen to “cooperate” with prosecutors in the Russia probe, and claimed pardoning him if he’s indicted or convicted of a crime is “obviously not on the table.” “It has not been discussed, and would not be discussed” Giuliani said. “I’m a big believer in the pardon power. ... But right now, pardons would be a bit ― they wouldn’t be illegal to talk about, they’d be kind of confusing.” Either way, Giuliani said it’s time for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to shut down Mueller’s investigation. “There’s no question that the amount of government misconduct is accumulating,” he said. “I happen to believe it’s greater than anybody realizes.” President Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani tells @GStephanopoulos a pardon for Michael Cohen “is not on the table. That isn’t a decision to be made now. There’s no reason to pardon anybody now… It has not been discussed.” https://t.co/bKAHeA5LAy pic.twitter.com/KFOz6yeJTM Giuliani said last week that Trump first found out about the payment to Daniels― whose real name is Stephanie Clifford― several weeks ago, but claimed Sunday that he was less certain of the timeline.  “I don’t know when the president learned about it,” he said. “The reality is those are not facts that worry me as a lawyer. Those don’t amount to anything ― what is said to the press. That’s political.” “It’s okay to lie to the press?” Stephanopoulos interrupted. “Gee, I don’t know,” Giuliani responded. “You know a few presidents who did that. I don’t think that this president has done that. But in any event, that’s not the crime.”  Rudy Giuliani on @ThisWeekABC: ""What is said to the press, that's political.""George Stephanopoulos: ""It's okay to lie to the press?""Giuliani: ""Uh...gee, I don't know."" pic.twitter.com/VjrmQO7aUK “I never thought $130,000 was a real payment ― it’s a nuisance payment,” Giuliani said. “I don’t like saying this, but it’s not a great deal of money ― $1.3 million is a great deal of money,” he continued. “That’s the kind of money you would think of as a settlement. If I saw $130,000, I would never think it was to settle a substantial claim against my client.”  Giuliani smears Daniels as ""woman you saw on SNL last nite trying to make more money,"" then adds this gem: ""I know this sounds funny to people at home - I never thought $130k was a real payment. It's a nuisance payment...People don't go away for $130k if it's a meritorious claim"" pic.twitter.com/WdRnFeaElp “I have no knowledge of that, but I would think if it was necessary, yes,” Giuliani said. “[Cohen] made payments for the president or he conducted business for the president.” Speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union,” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said she didn’t personally know about payments other than the one to Daniels, though she also added a caveat. If such payments were made, “they didn’t cross my desk as campaign manager” in the 2016 election, Conway told Jake Tapper. Did Michael Cohen make payments to other women on behalf of the president? Rudy Giuliani tells @GStephanopoulos: “I have no knowledge of that, but I would think if it was necessary, yes."" https://t.co/R6JsMQN9yM pic.twitter.com/Ol0Hpb0Xp9 Giuliani told multiple news outlets last week that Cohen had complained after the 2016 election about Trump not reimbursing him for the Daniels payment. But Giuliani appeared to downplay those statements Sunday, calling Cohen’s alleged complaints just “one of the rumors.”  “But that’s what you said,” Stephanopoulos said. “You stated it as fact.” “Well maybe I did,” Giuliani responded. “I don’t know. How do you separate fact and opinion?” While discussing whether Trump would testify in the Russia probe, Giuliani claimed the special counsel’s team was behind a New York Times report that featured 49 questions Mueller wants to ask the president. But Stephanopoulos pushed back on that theory. “Those questions were written by [Trump attorney] Jay Sekulow after a meeting with Mueller and his team,” Stephanopoulos told Giuliani. “And these were ... the impression of the Trump team’s take on the questions, and in fact it was a document made by the Trump team. It wasn’t something leaked by Mueller.” “Could it have been somebody formerly on our side? Could it have been somebody formerly on theirs? I don’t know,” Giuliani responded. “Main fact is I don’t care. My client’s prejudiced by that, but in a way we were helped by it.” As expected, Daniels’ attorney, Michael Avenatti, was waiting in the wings to skewer Giuliani over his “train wreck” of an interview Sunday. “It’s an absolute, unmitigated disaster for Rudy Giuliani and the president,” Avenatti said. “I can’t believe that that actually just happened. I mean, what we witnessed by Rudy Giuliani may be one of the worst TV appearances by any attorney on behalf of a client in modern times.” Stormy Daniels’ attorney @MichaelAvenatti calls Giuliani’s interview with @GStephanopoulos, “an absolute, unmitigated disaster for Rudy Giuliani and the president… I think it is obvious to the American people that this is a cover-up; that they are making it up as they go along.” pic.twitter.com/cURpRlV3Ce Nick Visser contributed to this report."
BUSINESS,"There has been much greater concern about the danger of asset bubbles ever since the collapse of the housing bubble sank the economy. While it is good that people in policy positions now recognize that bubbles can pose a real danger, it is unfortunate that there still seems very little understanding of the nature of the problem. First, an economy-threatening bubble does not just sneak up on us. Often the discussion of bubbles implies that we need some complex measuring tools to uncover an economy-threatening bubble that’s lurking in some far corner of the data.  This is absurd on its face. If a bubble is large enough to threaten the economy, it is hard to miss. This was true of both the stock bubble in the 1990s and the housing bubble in the last decade.  At the peak of the stock bubble in 2000, the ratio of stock prices-to-trend corporate profits was more than twice its long-term average. This may have been justified if there was an expectation that profit growth was going to be much faster in the future, but almost no economic analysts projected this speed up.  Higher price-to-earnings ratios could also be justified if stockholders were prepared to accept lower returns on their stock than they had in the past. But there was no evidence this was the case. In fact, most stockholders seemed to expect that the double-digit returns of the recent past would continue. In the case of the housing bubble, inflation-adjusted house prices had risen by more than 70 percent above their long-term trend. This unprecedented run-up in house prices occurred at a time when rents were essentially moving in step with the overall rate of inflation, suggesting that there was no major shift in the fundamentals of the housing market. Furthermore, vacancy rates were already at record highs even before the bubble burst, providing clear evidence that house prices were not being driven by a shortage of housing. And, both bubbles were clearly moving the economy. In the case of the stock bubble, investment hit its highest share of GDP since the late early 1980s, as start-ups were taking advantage of sky-high share prices to finance crazy schemes. Also, the wealth generated by the stock bubble led to a surge in consumption that pushed the savings rate to a then-record low. In the case of the housing bubble, high prices led to a flood of new construction, raising the residential investment share of GDP to almost 6.5 percent, compared to a long period average of less than 4.0 percent. The wealth created by the housing bubble led to an even larger consumption boom than the stock bubble.  All of this was easy to see from widely available government data sets. It required no more than an Excel spreadsheet to analyze these data. So this was not rocket science, it was basic economic logic and arithmetic.  Should we be concerned about a bubble now? Stock prices and housing prices are both high by historical standards. The ratio of stock prices-to-trend corporate earnings is more than 27-to-1; this compares to a long-term average of 15-to-1.  House prices are also high by historic standards. Inflation-adjusted house prices are still well below their bubble peaks, but are about 40 percent above their long-term average. In both cases, these markets are high, although in ways that are at least partly explained by the fundamentals of the market. In the case of stock prices, the profit share of GDP is almost 30 percent above its trend level. If this persists, then the ratio of prices-to-earnings is much closer to the long-term average. Of course, a big cut in the corporate tax rate increases the likelihood that a high-profit share in GDP will continue. Extraordinarily low-interest rates (both real and nominal) also mean that stocks provide a relatively better return compared with alternatives like bonds and short-term deposits. This also would change if interest rates rise substantially, but for now, that doesn’t seem likely. The run-up in house prices also seems less disconcerting when we consider there has been a parallel run up in rents. While rents have not increased as much as house prices, they have been substantially outpacing the overall rate of inflation for the last five years. Low-interest rates would also help to explain house prices being above long-term trends, as they justify a higher ratio of sales prices-to-rents. Here also, there is a risk that higher rates could send prices tumbling. This could be an especially bad story for moderate-income homeowners, since the bottom tier of the housing market has seen the largest price increases over the last five years.    But even in a bad story, where for example higher interest rates send both stock and house prices back towards their trend levels, we don’t have to fear an economic collapse and probably not even a recession. The high stock market is not driving investment, which remains very modest despite near record-high after-tax profits. Housing construction has come back from its post-crash lows, but is roughly in line with its long-term average share of GDP. The loss of trillions of dollars of wealth would be a hit to consumption. Consumption has been unusually high in recent years with the savings rate averaging just 3.6 percent of disposable income in the last year. A more normal savings rate would be closer to 6.0 percent. But even if the savings rate were to rise to 6.0 percent over a span of a year or two, it would likely dampen growth rather than cause a recession. In short, there is little reason to think that the economy is threatened by the risk of collapsing bubbles at the moment. This doesn’t mean that holders of large amounts of Bitcoin or Amazon stock may not have something to worry about, but most of us don’t. "
ENTERTAINMENT,"Chip Gaines dismissed an online article that accused him and his “Fixer Upper” co-star wife Joanna of failing to put their family first. Gaines said he doesn’t know USA Today contributor Daryl Austin, whose article last week wondered how the HGTV stars could “even find the time to brush their teeth, let alone spend quality, one-on-one time with each child daily.” But Gaines rejected the criticism, and said it’s possible to have both “an amazing family AND career you love.” “I don’t know daryl, & he clearly doesn’t know me,” Gaines wrote on Twitter. “But for the record: If there is ever a need w/ my family (1st), I’ll shut this circus down so fast it will make your head spin. BUT jo & I believe, w/ God anything is possible. Including having an amazing family AND career you love.”  Austin argued the Gaineses have too many business ventures and TV commitments to live up to the child-centric image they present. The couple, who are expecting their fifth child together, recently wrapped the final season of their hit show, “Fixer Upper,” and said they now want to focus on one thing: their family.   “Chip and Joanna Gaines did not get where they are by putting their family first,” Austin wrote. “They want to be seen as a couple that can do it all while at the same time making their family their top priority. This is just not possible, and it does a disservice to the parents who really are putting their children first.”  The author added: “No matter how rich and famous, we are all limited by the same 24 hours in a day. You cannot do all they’ve done (or even a fraction of it) and still have any real time left over for family. Frankly, I wonder where they even find the time to brush their teeth, let alone spend quality, one-on-one time with each child daily.”  Joanna Gaines talked about the couple’s decision to leave “Fixer Upper” in an AOL Build interview last year. ″For people, they think there’s got to be a reason, like, ’Oh, something bad happened and therefore that’s why they’re leaving the show,′” she said. “I think it’s just hard for people to comprehend, no, we’re just leaving because it’s right instinctively for us and our family. No negative reason.” Chip Gaines’ mother, Gayle Gaines, offered additional insight into why the couple were walking away from their show in a 2017 interview with Closer Weekly.  Chip and Joanna “earned some time to rest,” Gayle Gaines said. “They care very much about how their children turn out, and they are very well aware that spending time with them and investing in their lives is important.”  And pretty soon, they’ll have another little one to look after.  A post shared by Chip Gaines (@chipgaines) on Jan 2, 2018 at 7:08pm PST"
ARTS & CULTURE,"Nearly 700 “Nasty Women” artists teamed up to protest President-elect Donald Trump earlier this month, contributing to an exhibition responding to his infamous debate barb. The show, co-organized by New York-based artist /www.roxannejackson.com/""}}"">Roxanne Jackson, featured “nasty”-related works priced at $100 or less ― all of which were sold to benefit Planned Parenthood. The pieces were on view from Jan. 12 through Jan. 15, at Queens’ Knockdown Center, and, over the course of three days, sold out, raising $42,500, according to Jackson.  The NYC version of “Nasty Women” is but one of several shows planned in various cities across the country. As Jackson explained in an email to The Huffington Post, a “Nasty” show in Phoenix, Arizona, that opened on Jan. 14 sold out of over 200 works in the opening night alone, raising $11,000 for Planned Parenthood. In total, the “Nasty” organizers have raised over $50,000 for the nonprofit organization devoted to reproductive health services ― and counting. The significant contribution is timely. Trump has expressed a desire to defund Planned Parenthood and “punish” women for having abortions. Jackson originally posted a callout for a “Nasty Women” group show on Nov. 14, 2016. “Hello female artists/curators! Let’s organize a NASTY WOMEN group show!!! Who’s interested???” she wrote, tagging women artists, curators and writers in her circle.  Soon after posting, the message went viral as artist after artist responded to and passed on the message. “I had no idea how much this would escalate and evolve,” Jackson explained to HuffPost in a previous interview. Within the first hour of posting, she had 300 responses. Jackson’s team accepted every work offered after that and, as a result, they acquired approximately 1,000 pieces by the time submissions closed.  “This show isn’t necessarily about highlighting individual artists,” Jackson explained. “It’s about female-identifying artists coming together against the Trump regime.”  There are currently almost 30 “Nasty Happenings” scheduled for the next two months, located mostly in American cities with a few shows set abroad. On the official “Nasty Women” website, Jackson and her team invite artists interested in organizing their own “Nasty Women” show to add their own dates, providing instructions with only one caveat: all shows adopting the “Nasty” name must donate their proceeds to an organization benefiting women’s rights.   UPDATE: Tara Plath from the Knockdown Center told HuffPost that an additional $8,000 raised via tickets sales to “Nasty Women” evening performances will be donated to four organizations: Girls for Gender Equity, SisterSong, the New York Immigration Coalition, and Callen-Lorde Community Health Center."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Given the incessant pace of the internet, and the antics of the current presidential administration, staying up to date with American current events can be exhausting, if not harrowing. Earlier this month, after former FBI director James Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, the web was buzzing with familiar hot takes and political predictions, mostly rehashing the same quotes and questions. A young poet by the name of Gordon Ip, however, packaged his take on the breaking news differently, breathing new life into yesterday’s news. “Kushner, Flynn, where does the truth begin?” he said, words flowing with urgency and poise. “Suspicion in the wind, static in our sleep, demanding our dreams, unquestioned loyalty. Our country is full of ‘no questions, please.’” Ip is a member of Get Lit, a troupe of young poets who make and perform slam poetry in and around Los Angeles. The nonprofit organization was launched by Diane Luby Lane in 2006 as an effort to increase literacy among elementary, middle and high school students through spoken word. It’s working. Compared to the 77 percent graduation rate of students in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest in the nation, 98 percent of all Get Lit Players graduate and go to college ― with 70 percent earning some sort of scholarship. Slam poetry, or spoken word, is part creative writing, part performance, a means to finding your voice and expressing it ― loudly. “Working with young people, it feels like you’re helping to shape someone’s idea of themselves,” Lane told HuffPost. “Young people are so open, their lives can go so many different directions. There are so many young people that are artists, writers, performers, who don’t know what to do with their talent. If they don’t have that avenue, what a waste. It can be the difference between getting a scholarship to college and dropping out of school.” For the past 20 weeks, the Get Lit Players have been participating in a series called “Get Lit NOW,” using current events as a springboard for poetry that melds the political and the personal, addressing national and global concerns in one unfiltered voice. Mila Cuda, a high school senior and newly elected Poet Laureate of Los Angeles, serves as the editor.  Topics broached in the series range from healthcare to climate change to rape culture, depending on the week’s most recent happenings. Each subject is communicated, however, through the singular perspective of the poet, translated into an embodied and impassioned language all its own.  “Writing about politics is something I’ve explored more recently,” poet Jojo Louis told HuffPost. “I had been seeing these shocking things on the news, but I never really wrote about them. Once I started, I realized how much my opinion matters. Poetry helps me spread the word about what I feel.” Louis, who is 19 years old, wrote and performed a piece addressing reports that President Donald Trump had ordered the launch of 59 missiles against Syria, which he initially misidentified as Iraq, while enjoying “the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you’ve ever seen,” as the president described.  Louis’ poem dramatizes Trump’s bizarre description of his dessert, as well as his inability to recall which country he had attacked. Louis blasts Trump’s machismo facade with a masterful mix of satire and solemnity. “Should we let them in? Lock them up? Shuffle up the deck and bomb the shit out of whichever card comes up?” he asks.  For the young poet, the challenge of making the political poetic rests in his ability to show the implications actions have on actual individuals. “When I see something on the news, I immediately think about how it directly affects me,” he said. “After that, I think more about its universal impact. I try to put my all into it: my experience, my story.” Another poet, 18-year-old Samantha Healy, addressed Syria in her poem, which she performed just after a gruesome chemical weapons attack left scores of citizens, many of whom were children, dead.  “We could fund the arts or tear the world apart,” Healy says, eyes burrowing into the camera. “Are we nationalists or just negligent? Are we nationalists or just negligent? Are we practicing policies of isolation? Trying to be bipartisan but only being bystanders? We are not innocent when we watch violent acts. And we are not innocent when we commit them.”  Like Louis, Healy is relatively new to writing poetry about political topics. “I usually wrote about my own personal experiences,” she told HuffPost. “When I first hear about something happening in the world, I am a very empathetic person, so there’s a lot of emotion. I immediately write down the emotions, then I get the facts down.” While poetry is often written off too quickly as elusive, elitist or out of touch, the Get Lit Players show the art form at its most urgent and accessible, words pumping with adrenaline. “Poetry has a level of honesty to it,” Louis described. “People bring more than just words to a poem. People bring their feelings. It can spark a fire in someone that influences their actions, or helps them look outside of their own personal experience.” Healy added that poetry is an especially potent medium for young people, who often encounter the art form when their lives and identities are still very much in flux. “You become part of a movement,” she said. “Everyone is so vulnerable and open; it creates such a healthy way to get through your pain. We’re changing something, we’re moving forward and we’re making a difference with our words and our honesty.” You can check out 20 young poets’ musings on political happenings through the Get Lit NOW Facebook page, and be sure to check back each week as a new poem is added.  Welcome to Battleground, where art and activism meet."
BUSINESS,"Sloppy data security practices at a toy company that sells a line of internet-connected stuffed animals has exposed the personal information of more than 800,000 customers, and some 2 million voice recordings ― many of them from children. The toy animals, manufactured by CloudPets, have the ability to store and replay voice messages sent to them via the internet. Ideally, that means traveling parents ― for instance, a deployed military member ― could send a heartfelt message to their child’s teddy bear at home, to be replayed when their child interacts with the bear: But since at least Christmas Day of last year, information on the CloudPets server ― including customers’ login and password information and voice recordings ― was stored in an exposed database easily accessible to anyone on the internet who knew where to look. Online security expert Troy Hunt is one of the first to have noticed the issue. He and several others attempted to alert CloudPets to the security oversight numerous times, yet never heard back. CloudPets also did not respond to a request for comment from The Huffington Post. With a little sleuthing, and some help from CloudPets users willing to serve as guinea pigs, Hunt tracked down some surprisingly personal information on the CloudPets servers. Kids’ names, birthdays (minus the year) and their relationship with authorized users (i.e., parents, grandparents, friends, etc.) were all accessible. So, too, were audio clips on the toys themselves. Hunt, who only accessed the information after obtaining permission from CloudPets users, describes on his website: One little girl who sounded about the same age as my own 4-year-old daughter left a message to her parents: Hello mommy and daddy, I love you so much. Another one has her singing a short song, others have precisely the sorts of messages you’d expect a young child to share with her parents. I didn’t download either pictures or recordings from other parties, only those I was specifically granted access to by HIBP subscribers, but the risk was clear. It’s also entirely possible a hacker could use that information to push messages to the toys themselves. The below video below ― which a Twitter user who goes by MisterZoomer told The Huffington Post his wife filmed as a lighthearted prank ― is a terrifying example of what’s actually possible with the technology: Hey @CloudPets someone named S. Atan keeps sending messages to my kids' cloud pets and the app won't let me block him. Please help. pic.twitter.com/ETudxTQ0oA “Parents need to work on the assumption that if they have a CloudPet, multiple unauthorized parties could have accessed their voice recordings,” Hunt told The Huffington Post in an email. “Because the service is still online today and account details were also leaked, those recordings could still potentially be accessed today.” Those recordings don’t necessarily present a security threat in and of themselves, Hunt said, but parents should certainly be aware of what’s out there. And CloudPet users should be sure to change their passwords, especially if they’ve reused them for other internet accounts. “Many of the same problems are present we have in other data breaches: email addresses could be used for spam or phishing, and reused passwords could be used to exploit other accounts,” added Hunt. “There’s little practical value for children’s voice recordings, but of course as parents we’d feel very uneasy knowing that other people could have them.” The main takeaway? Think twice before you welcome any internet-connected device into your home, particularly ones that children may interact with on a regular basis. “The bigger picture here is to think very carefully before giving a child a connected device like this,” Hunt concluded. “By all means, get them involved early with computers and responsible internet use, but in my view connected toys like this pose too great a risk.” Hackers haven’t just accessed the data, according to Hunt. He says there’s clear evidence cybercriminals have held the database for ransom, at least twice, demanding money from the company in exchange for the data’s safe return. The database was no longer publicly accessible as of Jan. 13, Hunt said, but anyone who obtained the data while it was live could still use it for nefarious purposes, including accessing a victim’s account. “This service ― and the files ― really need to be taken offline ASAP until everything can be properly secured,” Hunt said."

San Francisco Ballet in Helgi Tomasson's Romeo and Juliet (Photo:Erik Tomasson) Helgi Tomasson's Romeo and Juliet made a comeback at San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House last night, buoyed by a vivid and sensitive performance of the Prokofiev score by the San Francisco Ballet Orchestra, under the electrifying baton of Martin West.  The theme of the tragic fallout from senseless political feuding was given short shrift in favor of teen romance and botched parenting. The conflict between the Montagues and Capulets, captured in the stirring street fight scene in Act I, faded quickly. Ballet to the People missed the class struggle of Lavrovsky's original 1940 Socialist Realist production, the bold crowd scenes of John Cranko's 1962 interpretation, and the oppressive grandeur of Kenneth MacMillan's in 1965 that did so much to set the broader social and political context.  Long stretches of unmemorable choreography, at times deaf to the emotional swells of Prokofiev, were punctuated by brilliant outbursts from the exceptional supporting cast -- notably Sofiane Sylve as a very complicated Lady Capulet, Anthony Vincent as the cruel and imposing Tybalt, Hansuke Yamamoto and Taras Domitro as Romeo's wing men, and Dores André and Dana Genshaft as the lusty Harlots. Though given too much airtime for such inconsequential roles, the Acrobats Norika Matsuyama, Francisco Mungamba and Wei Wang brought the house down with their elegant, fearless tumbling and spinning. In this Romeo and Juliet, people take an awfully long time to die. In truth, since the deaths are driven by the music, they take no longer than in other productions that employ the same score, but it's an indication of how unfocused the choreography is in those moments where the victims seem to take forever to expire.
Sarah Van Patten and Carlos Quenedit in Helgi Tomasson's Romeo and Juliet (Photo:Erik Tomasson) In certain critical scenes, however, Tomasson's storytelling shone far beyond the histrionics of MacMillan, Cranko and Lavrovsky. (Ballet to the People is partial, though, to Lavrovsky's ending, in which he depicts the reconciliation of the two families after the tragic double suicide: A vote for humanity.)  In Act I, Juliet and her gate-crashing admirer steal a private moment during the Capulets' ball, while the other guests head for the buffet. Their get-to-know-you pas de deux is full of delightful, subtle touches and delicate, airy lifts.  Later, in the ballroom, Tybalt accosts the masked Romeo and, identifying him as an interloper, tries to bounce him. Lord Capulet intervenes, not wanting to wreck the party vibe, and Lady Capulet steps in to calm the hot-headed Tybalt. She and Tybalt have a private huddle downstage, implying more strongly than most productions that she and her nephew are having an affair.  Sylve's Lady Capulet steals Act II at the very end, as she mourns the death of Tybalt with a terrifying eloquence, and tries to assault the guilt-stricken Romeo. The crack-of-dawn bedroom pas de deux that opens Act III is a towering achievement of Tomasson's production. So is the following scene in which Juliet battles her parents for control of her destiny -- perhaps the most pivotal scene in the entire ballet, as this is where she makes the dramatic decision that leads to the double suicide.  Sarah Van Patten was not entirely convincing in Act I, her dancing too controlled and mature for the role, lacking the inchoate longing of a cloistered, but sensitive and inquisitive, 14-year-old of the Italian Renaissance. But she relaxed and found a youthful impetuosity for the secret wedding in Friar Laurence's chapel in Act II. By Act III, she fully inhabited the role. The pas de deux choreography makes the most of her expressive supported arabesque, with arms that breathe beautifully into an unclassically wide open shape. Where MacMillan's choreography for this scene is breathless, more naturalistic and less balletic, Tomasson's is more nuanced; absorbing in its build-up, it culminates in a passionate snog on the bedroom floor.  In Juliet's struggle with her parents, who are determined to marry her off to the wealthy, aristocratic Paris, Van Patten conveys the fragility of Juliet as well as her heroic determination. Tomasson builds up this scene masterfully. After Lord Capulet storms out of Juliet's bedroom in disgust, the orchestra catches its breath, and in that moment of silence, Lady Capulet gives her daughter a look of hatred and follows her husband into the wings, her heels clattering ominously. Carlos Quenedit plays the dashing, ardent Romeo with the perfect blend of nobility and abandon. His turning jumps with one leg whipped out of the hip like a brandished sword were particularly spectacular.  Hansuke Yamamoto made an audacious Benvolio, sailing through the air as he circled the stage with a series of turning leaps that seemed natural and unforced in their elevation.  Heart-throb Taras Domitro as the cavalier Mercutio tossed off his technical challenges with ease. But he is given a kitchen sink of emotions to portray during his death scene, which register as a somewhat incoherent, slapstick muddle.  In contrast, the orchestra's strings, woodwinds and brass in turn bring out individual colors in the score to poignant, exhilarating or fearsome effect. Surely, Prokofiev would be thrilled. San Francisco Ballet's Romeo and Juliet runs through May 10, 2015 at the War Memorial Opera House. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Sue Grafton, who authored “The Kinsey Millhone Alphabet” mystery series, died Thursday in Santa Barbara, California, after a battle with cancer, her daughter announced on the writer’s Facebook page Friday. She was 77. Grafton began the “Kinsey Millhone” books ― which take their titles from each letter of the alphabet ― with A is for Alibi back in 1982. She died before completing the series, which now ends with Y is for Yesterday. The final installment, Z is for Zero, was originally slated for publication in 2019. ″[A]s far as we in the family are concerned, the alphabet now ends at Y,” Grafton’s daughter Jamie Clark wrote. The author was “adamant” that her books not be adapted for the screen or ghostwritten, her daughter said, so the series is unlikely to get a neat finale. Grafton was “surrounded by family” at the time of her death, Clark wrote, noting that her mother’s health declined rapidly this week after a two-year battle with an unspecified type of cancer. The daughter of crime novelist C.W. Grafton, Sue Grafton was born in 1940 and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, which appeared in some of her work. The city’s current mayor, Greg Fischer, shared a note about Grafton’s death on social media Friday, writing, ”[I]n Louisville we have lost a citizen, friend, neighbor, a master gardener and hometown hero.” The world has lost a great talent and prolific author in Sue Grafton — and in Louisville we have lost a citizen, friend, neighbor, a master gardener and hometown hero. Her legacy will live on through her words, which will entertain and thrill readers for generations to come. pic.twitter.com/Lc4xLXnjiP The “Kinsey Millhone” series, set in the ’80s, centers around a private detective by the same name in the fictional town of Santa Teresa, California.  “Kinsey remains the series’ one constant ― by turns funny, moody, shrewd, loyal, profane, tough and vulnerable. In a word, human,” wrote one reviewer on the 20th book, T is for Trespass, in 2007. The series landed Grafton on The New York Times’ bestseller list and earned her a number of awards, including the title of Grand Master, bestowed by the Mystery Writers of America. Installments have been published in 26 languages. In a letter to readers on her website, Grafton addressed her plan after she reached the end of the alphabet with Z is for Zero, writing, “No clue.” “These novels about Ms. Millhone take incredible focus, ingenuity, energy, and imagination. If I have the wherewithal, I may write a Kinsey Millhone stand-alone or two,” she said. “If I feel I’ve lost my touch, I’ll retire with grace.” Grafton’s publisher, Penguin Random House, said in a statement on Twitter that the company was “devastated” by the loss.

ENTERTAINMENT,"Streaming service Netflix has been looking to buy its own series of movie theaters, according to The Los Angeles Times. The newspaper, citing sources familiar with the matter, reported that the company attempted to reach a deal with L.A.-based Landmark theaters, but negotiations went south because Netflix believed the asking price was too high. Why the streaming giant would need to buy theaters may have something to do with its strained relationship with the Cannes Film Festival.  Netflix, still looking to be seen as a legitimate filmmaking entity, pulled out of Cannes this year after the festival decided movies without theater distribution in France would not be allowed to compete for prizes. This continues a storied war between the streaming service and the French festival. The Netflix original film “Okja” was featured at the Cannes Film Festival in 2017, but when the film was shown, the Netflix logo drew boos from the festival crowd. Netflix original films have been gaining critical acclaim in recent years. “Mudbound” received four 2018 Oscar nominations and “Icarus,” a film about the doping scandal surrounding Russian Olympic athletes, won this year’s Oscar for best documentary. Netflix productions have also won four Golden Globes and 37 Emmy Awards. As filmmaking evolves in the streaming age of Netflix and Amazon, it’s difficult to know what role brick-and-mortar theaters will play in the future of the movie-making business. Maybe Netflix knows something we don’t?"

I grew up a white-boy wannabe blues guitar player, getting close enough to play out in some bands and adventurous enough to end up with a '59 Fender Stratocaster and a '53 Telecaster.  But the main thing is I grew up on blues music - R&B - ""ethnic"" they called it back when I was listening to the two black radio stations in St. Louis - KXLW and KATZ.  And BB King was the man, despite never really having a mainstream commercial hit until ""The Thrill is Gone"" earned him a Grammy in 1970.  Didn't mater.  There was ""Rock Me Baby,"" ""Every Day I Have the Blues,"" ""Sweet Little Angel,"" ""How Blue Can You Get?,"" and many more, for those who knew where to find them... Jump ahead, through the blur of high school and college and grad school - after which I land this amazing job with a fabulous St. Louis ad agency - D'Arcy MacManus Masius - who had Budweiser, and most of the Anheuser-Busch business, since 1909.  A year later I'm in the beer business - which for me was like going to heaven without having to die first - and three years later I'm a wise ass 28-year old running the business, or at least I was supposed to be.   Then everything changes:  we launch ""This Bud's for You"" and begin to make advertising and beer history.  In fact Budweiser was the first ever advertiser to use blues music in their advertising, something BBC interviewed me for for their two-part documentary, ""The History of Blues in America.""  Music was always at the core of Budweiser's advertising:  ""Where There's Life There's Bud;"" ""When You Say Budweiser, You've Said it All;"" ""Here Comes the King;"" and now ""This Bud's for You."" Until then the agency produced various arrangements of the commercial jingle with New York and Los Angeles studios; ""sound alikes,"" they called them.  Now it's time for ""This Bud's for You"" and this young black kid, the only one at D'Arcy at the time, comes to me with what can only be described as a precursor to ... rap.  ""Bustin' Bud Suds,"" he calls it, and tells me it should sound like Johnny Guitar Watson.  'Course I knew who JT was - so, says me, hell, let's just hire Johnny!  And we do.  No more sound alikes.  We go on to hire ... Rick James, The Temptations, George Thorougood, Billy Preston, The Busboys, Stanley Clarke, Herbie Hancock, Bootsy Collins, Lou Rawls, Frankie Beverly and the Maze and many more ... And BB King. Got to have BB.   First time I actually meet B is at a taping of the United Negro College Fund's ""Lou Rawls Parade of Stars"" fundraiser, in Las Vegas.  I'd hired Lou to be Budweiser's national spokesperson (http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising/buds-lou-83882) - the first ever black to represent a national brand. Lou knows I love B and takes me over and introduces me.  B gives me one of his personalized guitar picks. From humble beginnings ...
Lou Rawls, the author, and BB King, backstage, Las Vegas, 1979. Our New York agency guys set a meeting for me and B after a concert in St. Louis, and backstage I go to meet my lifelong, he's-the-Man idol.  I walk into his dressing room, crowded with admirers, hangers on, band members and road girl friends, and soon as I do B's ushering everybody out!  Clears them all out, so that he and I can get down to business.  I take a folding chair in the back room and my eyes land on ... Lucille!  Jesus - there it is, his baby, his Lucille, sitting right damn there on the floor in an open guitar case, ready for him to take out on stage in about 15 minutes.  It was all I could do to not get down on my knees and submit to solitary worship or something. This meeting is for concept only.  The mojo.  Sure, he says, he'd love to do something with our ""This Bud's for You"" music.  Artists loved our take on ""commercial jingles:"" no sell, no endorsements, no ""this is BB King, drink Budweiser.""  Just the Bud melody and vocal in the first and last eight bars, and in between - jam.  The melody is so well known we get most artists to do instrumental-only versions! Which we air.  Zero words.  Just the music. Most artists jam to their next release, knowing they'd get huge airplay.  All that's left is formality with B's agent, which is done before his next concert, two nights later. A few weeks later and it's time for the session.  We're doing it in San Diego where he's got a major arena concert the night before, so we're there in time for the gig.  Backstage I go, again.  This time the room's crowded and no need to clear it out.  And there, over in the corner not paying nobody no mind, is ... John Lee Hooker!  Jesus!  Well, almost.  Actually, better.  Over I go, got to say hey.  He's looking at me with some kind of curiosity and finally says, to this white guy, ""Boy, how you know who I am?""  Seriously, I'm thinking?  ""Cause, I do.  I grew up with you, and I love your shit.""  He likes that. Next day - ok late afternoon, ok evening - we're in the studio, which one has long since escaped me.  B's bus brings them all, him, the band, miscellaneous whoevers, and we get into it.  Each track is laid down:  rhythm, horns, background vocals, B's lead vocal.   B sits right there in the control room with the rest of us for the whole session.  Occasional comment, likes what's going on.  Story telling.  One he tells me is a classic: one night after a gig out on the road B's telling me he's ready to call on one of his many lady's.  He shows up at her house and knocks on the door.  This is way past the midnight hour ... and from way back of the house he hears, ""B, is that you?!?""  It's Ray Charles himself!  ""The great Ray Charles! The high priest."" Back in there with B's lady of choice for this town, for this night.  Off B goes, no doubt to his second choice.  I know this is true for one because a creative partner of mine, years later, works with Ray and gets the same story.  Besides, more years later I'm replaying the story to B, and he says, ""Yeah, and I know who that was.""  And names her.  Damn if I can't remember the lady's name!
""This Bud's for You"" session, in control room before laying down guitar lead, 1980.
                    (Autographed later). Then it's time for B and Lucille to lay down the guitar solo.  It's just B out in the studio all by his ownself, with his baby.  And he's trying to get the melody.  Again.  And again.  And he just cannot hit it.  B doesn't play notes.  He plays from his soul.  I doubt if he can even read music, and am sure he never needed to. He's sweating bullets.  He's pushing it.  The notes just ain't there.  I'm in the control room and look over to his bandleader.  We shake our heads, simpatico.   So out I go into the studio, and kneel down next to my idol, my man, to talk.  Back in the control room my agency guys are going, ""Jesus Christ, here goes Arnold out there to tell BB King how to play guitar.""  Not exactly.  What I tell him is, ""forget it B.  Screw the melody.  Play your thing.  Play B's version of the intro.""  A palpable sigh of relief, and gratitude.  And he kills it.   Now it's like 3 am and his crew is long gone, out in his bus.  I ask B if we can get a photo and sure, he says, and goes out to his bus and wakes every last dude up to come back inside for a group shot ...


Budweiser recording session, San Diego, 1980. Next time I see him is back in St. Louis, at the old StL Arena.  He's appearing with Albert King - another one of those guys I worshiped - and B introduces me to him.  This is years after our commercial session.  B must know by now there's nothing much to gain, outside of connecting a fellow blues dude to another legend.  That's what kind of guy B is.
BB King, the author, Albert King, St. Louis Arena, 1983 I see him a few more times along the way, when he comes to New York.  I remember one time sitting back stage with him when Dr. John - who's sharing the bill - comes by to say they need to play Happy Birthday for somebody.  ""What key you want?,"" Doc says.  ""B,"" says B.  Each time it's his road manager that I see first, usually opening the door to the dressing rooms.  ""Here he 'tis,"" he'd say, ""Give that man a Schlitz!"" And we'd all laugh, every time.  A good guy.  Can't remember his name, but he would send me postcards from Europe, when they were on tour. Last time I see BB King is up in Peekskill, New York, after an appearance at the historic Paramount Theater.  By now he's talking to the audience as much as he's doing music.  Doesn't matter.  He's earned it.   After his concert I sit outside his bus waiting, long after midnight and some 30 years and a lot of miles after our Budweiser recording session.  Finally, in I go, and (re) introduce myself as the Budweiser guy who did that session with him those many years ago.  ""Yeah, I remember,"" he's gracious enough to say, even though I can't imagine he really does.  Didn't matter.  This is the kind of guy BB King is.  I tell him the Ray story.  He remembers that one for sure.
The author and BB King, in his bus, Peekskill, NY 2012 The whole world, not just the music world, has lost a special soul in BB King.  Despite his fame, his fortune, his legendary accomplishments, he will forever be a genuine, humble, gracious member of the human race, representing racial blindness and a gratitude for his blessings, for what he was able to achieve and, in his mannerisms and decorum, was able to give back.  This was evident in his concerts, and his personality.  And in the man I was blessed to have known some. ""Oh I'm free, free, free now ...*"" You sure are my friend.  And your spirit, and music, will live on in us forevah! *From ""The Thrill is Gone,"" as recorded by BB King (Hawkins, Roy/Darnell, Rick R.). All photos used by permission of the author. Tim Arnold

POLITICS,"Candidate Donald Trump promised Americans a war on the pharmaceutical industry. President Donald Trump isn’t going to give them one. On Friday afternoon, the Department of Health and Human Services released a policy blueprint for helping Americans pay for prescription drugs that, with every passing year, get harder and harder to afford. “Today, my administration is launching the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American people,” Trump said of the plan during a speech in the White House Rose Garden. Whether and how much the approach will ultimately reduce drug prices is unclear, and will probably remain so for some time. But while some of the ideas Trump endorsed have bipartisan support and the potential to help people, few experts expect the administration’s plan to have the kind of dramatic impact Trump once promised.  The health care industry certainly doesn’t seem scared. Stocks climbed following the speech, while analysts dismissed it loudly, using phrases like “non-event” and “waste of time.”  A missive from the health care trading desk at Jeffries said simply, “Jay-Z’s Blueprint far more impactful than HHS version.”  For those who think President Trump is taking on the drug companies, the industry and investors think otherwise --- shares are up. By a lot. pic.twitter.com/BXbssQm9JN Trump’s speech and a 39-page blueprint have been weeks in the making, although their roots lie in the 2016 presidential campaign, when Trump promoted himself as a different kind of Republican ― one who would stand up for average Americans and protect them from powerful corporate interests. The drug industry was high on the list of predators. He railed against them regularly, even after taking office, famously saying drugmakers were “getting away with murder” by charging such high prices for life-saving medications.  More controversially, Trump also endorsed an idea Democrats had long championed and Republicans had long opposed: having the federal government negotiate prices directly with drugmakers, just like the governments of other developed countries do. Name-brand drugs in those countries are far less expensive than they are in the U.S.  A year and a half into his presidency, and following some well-publicized meetings with precisely the sort of pharmaceutical industry leaders he once denounced, Trump has backed away from that rhetoric. He’s no longer calling to have the federal government negotiate with drugmakers over prices and, more generally, he no longer identifies the drug industry as the primary culprit behind high prices. Instead, Trump has adopted a more nuanced and in many ways more traditionally Republican argument for why prescriptions are so expensive. This view, which the White House Council of Economic Advisers laid out in a February report, blames high prices more on the excesses of big government than on the excesses of Big Pharma.  According to this argument, government insurance programs make drugs unnecessarily expensive. An example is the requirement that Medicare Part D plans ― the private insurance policies that provide seniors with prescription coverage ― include at least two drugs from each class. If the insurers who provide those plans could have just one drug from each class, administration officials say, insurers would have more negotiating leverage and could cover drugs more cheaply. Another issue is the way Medicare pays for drugs that specialty physicians, such as oncologists, deliver on an outpatient basis. Trump administration officials say this payment scheme gives the doctors incentive to provide the most highly priced therapies when cheaper drugs might be just as good, if not better, on a clinical basis. Trump is expected to call for restructuring those payments, in order to reduce that incentive. The administration has some other changes in mind, too. It wants to straighten out a complicated scheme of rebates and payments among insurance companies, drugmakers and a group of middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers. PBMs have received a great deal of scrutiny in recent years, because their payment arrangements are secret.  In theory, they are supposed to help insurers bargain for lower prices, which can then benefit consumers. In practice, critics say, PBMs strike deals that drive up their own profits without providing much relief for the people who get drugs. The precise details of how the administration plans to address these and other issues remain unclear, even in the blueprint. Absent more information, it’s impossible to know how aggressive the administration intends to be ― or what could be done through regulatory action, which the administration can handle on its own, versus legislation, which would require Congress to act. But the break with campaign rhetoric is clear and, in this respect, Trump’s approach to prescription drugs has a lot in common with the approach he has taken toward the insurance reforms of the Affordable Care Act. As a candidate, Trump promised to replace “Obamacare” with a more generous, more comprehensive universal coverage scheme. At several points, he suggested he might just push for a European-style, single-payer system in which the government would simply insure everybody. “Everybody’s going to be taken care of much better than they’re taken care of now,” he said shortly after taking office. Once in office, Trump abandoned such promises. The repeal bills he tried to pass would have downsized existing government programs and stripped away regulations designed to make sure everybody can get decent coverage, regardless of pre-existing condition. Had one of those bills become law, millions of people would have lost coverage. A common theme in the Obamacare repeal episode and, now, the effort on drug prices is Trump’s willingness to outsource policymaking to the GOP establishment, which remains loyal and sympathetic to the big corporations Trump attacked as a candidate.  Still, there are some critical differences as well.  With the repeal fight, Trump was largely outsourcing to congressional leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). They promoted extremely conservative ideas, including structural changes to Medicaid that would have dramatically reduced its funding. At times, they seemed more focused on getting a bill ― any bill ― through Congress than attempting to construct a workable alternative for helping people to get insurance. On prescription drugs, it appears Trump has largely turned policymaking over to a few key figures in his administration, chiefly Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services, and Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. Both are bona fide conservatives and have ties to the drug industry. Azar is a former Eli Lilly executive.  But in an administration full of ideological zeal and sometimes questionable competence, Gottlieb and now Azar have reputations for smarts, savvy and a serious commitment to governing. Gottlieb in particular has earned praise, even from Democrats, for the way he has managed the agency. And so perhaps it is not surprising that at least some of the ideas they have put on the president’s agenda enjoy a great deal of support from across the political spectrum. These days, it’s difficult to find anybody who understands health policy who’s willing to defend current PBM practices. And those changes to reimbursement for cancer and other specialty drugs? The Obama administration tried to do something similar. The administration also says it will seek to change the design of the Part D benefits, in ways that could make specialty drugs more affordable for the people who desperately need them but struggle to pay for them.  Each of these ideas comes with its own costs and potential dangers. Take the idea of changing the requirements on which drugs Part D plans cover, reducing the number from two to one in each class of treatment. The theory is that with two drugs, many people will take the more expensive one when they don’t need it. But if there’s just one, it could be harder for people who need a different drug to get one. (Think of somebody who needs a particular psychiatric drug in order to avoid certain side effects.) There is one element of the administration’s drug strategy that has a distinctly Trumpian tinge to it: criticism of other countries.  The administration argues that drug companies charge Americans more because, in other countries with price controls, they have to charge less. In this view, those other countries are basically getting a free ride, because American consumers are subsidizing the research and development that leads to breakthroughs. Trump says he will address that problem by somehow getting other countries to pay more of their fair share. Presumably, this would entail making drug prices, already a subject of trade negotiations, an even bigger priority, though it’s not clear how much leverage the U.S. has. Also, most economists doubt the prices that drug companies can get abroad have much, if anything, to do with the prices they charge here.  What’s not on the table are any of the big, potentially game-changing ideas like having the government negotiate directly with drugmakers, or allowing imports of cheap drugs from other countries, or radically redesigning the patent system (which some economists believe is both the source of high prices in this country and the easiest way to bring them down).  There are reasons for this. Conservatives like Azar and Gottlieb say such measures would cause more harm than good ― stifling innovation, limiting choices and ultimately depriving people of medicine they need.  Lots of reasonable people agree with that view, or at least worry about the possible effects of the government meddling with prices. The economics of pharmaceuticals, like health care policy generally, is complicated and full of trade-offs.  But the contrast with what Trump promised as a candidate could not be more stark. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"As fast as online discussions spread about President Donald Trump’s executive orders or odd jabs during TV shows, so do posts and Twitter threads on how best to practice self-care or reduce anxiety in a truly nonstop age of news. “Self-care” is a broad net for any combination of stress-reducing actions, from giving oneself a manicure to writing old-school style in a paper journal, from watching tea steep in hot water to deleting Facebook from a smartphone. For some, existential comfort can come in the form of divining the future, too.  Tarot cards have been used for centuries to help individuals process past events and look toward their future, with tarot readers explaining imagery and meaning to advise a client on his or her path. Often, individuals will come to a tarot reading with a non-binary question (in other words, a question that can’t be answered with “yes” or “no”) in mind. A reader’s interpretation of the cards selected from the tarot deck can provide direction for that once-murky quandary. Plagued by my own feelings of uncertainty in the wake of 2016’s election results, I wondered whether others were turning to tarot as a way to steady themselves in a tumultuous political time. I reached out to several tarot readers to discuss the significance of divination in today’s world. “When people are feeling uncertain or scared, they are more likely to seek guidance, especially the spiritual kind,” Theresa Reed, known online as “The Tarot Lady,” explained over email. “Some people choose a therapist, others may choose clergy ... and then there are those who seek out a tarot reader or other metaphysical practitioner. No matter whom they choose to work with, it all boils down to one thing: they want someone to help them find their way through the fog to a safe shore.” To begin to understand the usefulness of tarot reading in a person’s life, it does well to discard pop-culture notions of hands waving around a crystal ball and proclamations of a six-foot brunette soulmate. As Reed explains on her website, “No one has the ability to see your entire future. A reader can see what may be coming based on your current circumstances, but you can shift gears at any time.” Catherine Bowman, a poet and professor of creative writing at Indiana University who has taught classes on the tarot, explained, “I think those that seek out tarot are looking for alternative systems for meaning and in a world where the consensus and mainstream approaches for guidance are proving inadequate.” For the uninitiated, a tarot deck is made up of the Minor Arcana and the Major Arcana, with the former group of cards consisting of four suits (swords, wands, cups, and circles or pentacles). Like typical playing cards, Minor Arcana cards consist of numbers one through 10 and court cards like king, queen, etc. They are meant to represent the daily ups and downs one may experience in life. Naturally, the Major Arcana cards represent big events or stronger, longer-term energy in an area of life. There are 22 of these cards, and include imagery such as The Fool, Temperance, The Lovers and The Hanged Man. The meaning and spirituality that underlie the cards allow for a shift in perspective, one that could leave a tarot subject feeling better or more certain about future events than he did before — not unlike, as Reed said, the benefits of a therapeutic session. (To be clear, however, tarot and therapy are not the same.)  “The chance narratives that come out of tarot often present alternative paths to move through problems and day-to-day encounters that embolden the questioner, and provide creative and heartening ways to navigate through a ever-befuddling world,” Bowman explained. “A so-called irrational approach to problem-solving, tarot seems to make sense in a world that feels increasingly irrational and surreal.” “I think many people had a difficult 2016 and the election was a big cherry on top,” Mary Evans, of Spirit Speak Tarot, told me over an email. “So I have noticed a particular anxiousness, unsettledness, and desire to be grounded from recent clients.” Evans explained that each year has a card from the tarot deck associated with it — for 2017, it’s the Wheel of Fortune, “a card symbolizing drastic changes and the ultimate lack of control we have in the events our lives take. The affirmation to this card, is to let go of control and focus on how your actions can work for good.” Reed reported that, as a tarot reader, she was typically “swamped” from October through March, regardless of whether an election was on the horizon or had recently happened. However, tarot reader Lindsay Mack said that she had noticed an uptick in business toward the end of 2016. “I was doing pretty well before November, but now I’m currently booked up until March. I think people are really seeking a sense of clarity and empowerment during these times,” she said.  New president or not, the new year is a time when people naturally seek out guidelines to accomplish goals or trim negativity from their lives — be it in career, friendships, love or something else. Evans explained that she often sees clients during this time, “when we dedicate the most energy to self-reflection.” Because this new year aligned with Trump’s inauguration, Evans said she believed her clients were especially focused on taking control of their lives and accomplishing work.  “I do feel that in the wake of [the election], a subconscious security net has been taken away,” she said. “I think our past eight years of democracy, although people may have found flaws in it, allowed a certain feeling of safety. Today, many of us feel fear about the future of our country, our safety, and our rights. I think this underlying theme has caused my clients to find a new stance in developing a strength and security for themselves.” Mack echoed a similar idea, noting that major political changes can incite personal ones, that external chaos can increase one’s wish for internal harmony. “For the last three years, I’ve had the honor of serving and reading for people who were really in ‘seeking’ mode, shouldering a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety in their lives in general,” she expanded in an email. “Post election, it is the opposite. There is a far more proactive, soul-centered inquiry going on with the people I see currently. People are coming in with deeper questions, with a greater desire to be in their truth, to stand up and be of service to others in whatever way they can.” While detractors might argue that seeking comfort for oneself ultimately won’t change the course of politics, it’s possible that it might allow an individual to shore up resolve in a disheartening climate to continue working for what she believes is right. As Bowman, the professor, said, “Tarot has become an imaginative way for people to learn strategies for change, to access and see aspects of themselves that may have been hidden.” “The election is, at its core, a huge invitation to evolve, personally and collectively,” Mack said. “Thich Nhat Hanh’s phrase, ‘No mud, no lotus’ captures it beautifully. The election is the mud, and we are at choice. Do we stay stuck in the mud, in our old ways, in our fear ― or do we nourish a lotus from it? Can we choose growth and expansion through difficulty?” Using a tarot deck won’t reveal specifics on the nation’s future foreign policy or what other executive orders could be implemented. But for a reeling portion of the country, the spiritual practice can offer a sense of safety and assuredness in an era of doubt."
ENTERTAINMENT,"“Last Man Standing” is coming back.  The Tim Allen-led comedy was officially picked up by Fox for a seventh season, roughly a year after it was canceled by ABC. Allen will return as conservative Christian family man Mike Baxter, while co-stars Nancy Travis, Jonathan Adams, Amanda Fuller, Jordan Masterson, Christoph Sanders and Nancy Travis have also signed on.  In a Friday statement cited by Deadline and The Hollywood Reporter, Allen said he “did a fist pump so hard I threw my back out” after learning the news.  “Team LMS was in the sixth inning, ahead by four runs, stands were packed and then for no reason, they call off the game. It leaves you sitting in the dugout, holding a bat and puzzled,” he said. “I’m sure audiences will be curious to see what we look like after all these years. Oh, has it only been one year? Well, just goes to show you — a lot can happen in a year.” A number of entertainment outlets expressed surprise at the news, especially since it came just one day after Fox announced that it was canceling “The Mick” and the critically beloved “Brooklyn Nine-Nine.”  Previously, Allen had criticized ABC’s decision to ax “Last Man Standing” last year when the show continued to enjoy solid ratings. At the time, many fans believed his political views prompted the network to scrap the show. The right-leaning star attended President Donald Trump’s inauguration, and once compared being a conservative in Hollywood to 1930s Germany.  Fox Television Group CEOs Gary Newman and Dana Walden didn’t mention politics as having any impetus in resurrecting “Last Man Standing,” stating only that they’d “wanted to put the show back together since its final taping a year ago.”  Still, some critics suggested that the smash success of the “Roseanne” revival was a factor. Roseanne Barr is a Trump supporter both in real life and on-screen, and her show hasn’t shied away from depicting America’s current political climate. "
BUSINESS,"In a small, unassuming room on a university campus in the mid ’80s, one man sat amongst eleven women. They were meeting to discuss a relatively new movement that was emerging, called feminism. During the meeting the man overheard a side conversation between two of the women. The more vocal of the two was speaking on behalf of all women, explaining how they faced the same oppression by the patriarchy and needed to stand united to bring about change. The other woman’s response surprised the man, because she disagreed. She asked the other woman a simple question: “What do you see when you look in the mirror?” “A woman,” was her reply. It was the counter reply that stunned the man. She explained the difference, “When I wake up in the morning, if I look in the mirror, I see a black woman. To me, race is visible, but to you, it’s invisible.” The two women were from different races, one was white, the privileged race at the time, and the other was black, a race still fighting for equal privileges and against discrimination.  The black woman continued, explaining, “That’s how privilege works. Privilege is invisible to those who have it. It’s a luxury. The white people sitting in this room do not to have to think about race every split-second of their lives.” In hearing this, the man (Michael Kimmel) put his head in his hands and groaned. When asked by the woman what was wrong, he replied that when he looked in the mirror, he saw a human being. Not a man, because, he realized, being a man was a privilege in society and so it was invisible to him; he simply saw a human being. In today’s workplace, woman are still fighting for equality. For many males, it’s a cause that somewhat confuses them, and I don’t think it’s uncommon for many men to play out unspoken thoughts in their heads: What’s the problem? Aren’t we already equal? Why do we need to talk about it again? I don’t see why women keep making a big deal about it? Just get over it already. Men matter as well. If you want to be equal, stop making a big deal about being a woman and just get on with business.  We can’t see our way out of the problem Yet the problem is not about thoughts, it’s not about morals or character; it’s ultimately about sight. Last year a BBC presenter, John Inverdale, interviewed Andy Murray about winning his second gold medal at the Olympics, saying, “You’re the first person to ever win two Olympic tennis gold medals, that’s an extraordinary feat, isn’t it?” Murray replied that, actually, both William’s sisters had already won four gold medals each. First person to win two gold medals? When privilege is invisible, it might seem that way—but it is not that way, and we need to work together to get more clarity on the issue of gender equality. Like Andy Murray, there is a growing openness by men to call out gender bias and be part of the solution of equality; yet, for many, even when they want to champion equality there’s also an ongoing misunderstanding about what it means for everyone to experience equality in the workplace. Privilege is invisible, and when you have privilege it makes it very challenging to see the issue clearly. This is one of the reasons some male colleagues misinterpret their female counterparts who are vocal about the issue. So if we all want to get to the solution, while also acknowledging the challenge of the blind spot that privilege creates, how do we get there? Are we willing to listen deeply? I think it starts by listening to female advocates for diversity and women’s rights in the workplace, not with the intention to reply with a counter argument, but to listen deeply. If we are prepared to listen deeply in order to learn rather than reply, we can move forward with greater clarity towards real solutions. We need to acknowledge we can’t see or think our way out of the problem, rather, the solution lies in our willingness to listen; to listen deeply to one another. From there, we have the opportunity to make progress together, not as men, not as women, but as human beings. Article by Mick Mooney.

POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― Gina Haspel is on track to become CIA director after two key Democratic senators announced they intend to support her confirmation. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Tuesday that he will support Haspel because she had satisfied his concerns in public and behind closed doors about her views regarding the CIA’s so-called enhanced interrogation program, which she helped oversee in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. In a letter to Warner on Monday, Haspel wrote that the agency shouldn’t have undertaken the controversial program ― in which agents used waterboarding against terror suspects during interrogations. Such methods, she said, “did damage to our officers and our standing in the world.” Warner, a centrist whose home state of Virginia houses the CIA’s headquarters, called his decision to support Haspel “difficult,” and said he respected the views of his colleagues who disagree with him. “I believe [Haspel] is someone who can and will stand up to the President if ordered to do something illegal or immoral—like a return to torture,” Warner said in a statement. Shortly after Warner’s announcement, moderate Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) also said that she intended to support Haspel as CIA director.  “Ms. Haspel’s involvement in torture is deeply troubling,” Heitkamp said in a statement. “However, Ms. Haspel explained to me that the agency should not have employed such tactics in the past and has assured me that it will not do so in the future.” Later in the day, Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida became the fifth Democrat to announce backing for Haspel’s confirmation. Warner, Heitkamp and Nelson joined Sens. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who said last week they will vote to confirm Haspel. The group of Democrats would put Haspel’s nomination over the top, even if Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) continue to oppose her confirmation. Heitkamp, Nelson, Manchin and Donnelly all face what analysts rate as tough re-election battles this year in states President Donald Trump carried in 2016.  The announcement by the three Democrats on Tuesday capped a contentious debate about America’s use of torture, which became newly relevant after Trump pledged during the presidential campaign to bring back waterboarding and “much worse.” The news is reminiscent of the debate over Mike Pompeo’s nomination to lead the State Department ― when moderate or vulnerable red-state Democrats sided with Republicans to ultimately confirm him as the top U.S. diplomat.  Haspel’s initial reluctance last week to condemn the CIA’s past interrogation techniques during a public hearing with lawmakers spurred McCain, who was tortured while in captivity during the Vietnam War, to announce his opposition to her nomination. But he failed to sway many of his GOP colleagues, who pointed to Haspel’s large list of endorsements from the intelligence community. “I think it would have been helpful if John had been here in the [private, classified] sessions to get the full story,” Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) told HuffPost last week about McCain’s stance on Haspel. McCain remains at his home in Arizona, where he is battling brain cancer. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), who also sits on the intelligence committee, lamented that McCain’s colleagues felt his absence. “It’s one thing to vote [when] John McCain is in Sedona, it’s another thing to look him in the eye and tell him you’re not going to vote with him,” King, who plans to vote against Haspel, told The Boston Globe. “There’s no one in the Senate who has even remotely the credibility he does on an issue of this kind.” Warner, who will be up for re-election in 2020, had faced particular pressure from liberal activist groups in recent days to oppose Haspel’s nomination. Indivisible, a progressive group working to resist Trump’s agenda, held demonstrations in Virginia and also urged its members to call the senator’s office to urge him to come out against Haspel. “This was an opportunity where if Democrats had stuck together, we could have blocked her nomination, and Democrats didn’t do that,” Indivisible foreign policy manager Elizabeth Beavers told HuffPost. She added that the group’s members are “incredibly upset” by Warner’s decision. While Trump picked Haspel to lead the CIA, Beavers said, “Democrats own the fact that they helped secure the votes needed to confirm Haspel.” This story has been updated with Sen. Nelson’s backing of Haspel and comment from the progressive group Indivisible."
ARTS & CULTURE,"
Mbulelo Ndabeni, founder of London-based N'da Dance Company The growing number of empty seats at New York's Metropolitan Opera had a panel of opera critics agonizing over strategies to bolster audiences in a recent issue of The New York Times.

Ballet companies face the same patronage predicament. They, too, are reaching out to millennial audiences with high-tech productions and sci-fi story ballets, nurturing hip young choreographers. And they are grappling with the same question that tenor Russell Thomas brought to the opera debate: ""Why aren't the stages representative of the communities in which they are located?""

The traditional mold of a uniformly pale and willowy classical ballet ensemble is gradually being broken, not just by the vanguard Dance Theatre of Harlem and Ballet Black, but by companies like Ballet Memphis, Rambert Dance, and Birmingham Royal Ballet. Misty Copeland's leap into American mainstream consciousness has lit a rocket under ticket sales, inspired the creation of a Barbie doll in her image, and prompted at least one television announcer to admire the ""Misty Copeland-esque moves"" of a leading wide receiver in college football. Copeland's advocacy, her travels to Kenya to work with young dance students, her mentorship role in Project Plié, American Ballet Theatre's program to nurture young dance students of color, have all spotlighted for the broad public what was once a concern debated in relatively small circles: why aren't there more black ballet dancers?


Keelan Whitmore with students at Zama Dance School (Photo: Andrew Warth) Today, with more training opportunities available to talented young black students, filling the pipeline for these programs remains a challenge. How do you spot talent and recruit students when they may have no idea what ballet is? Unlike sport, which has long saturated mass media, ballet is still trying to shed its elitist reputation as the art form of kings who, pre-French Revolution, codified its vocabulary and used it to instill courtly manners.

Among the handful who are on a mission to diversify ballet's stages, one remarkable teacher zeroes in on that codification as a boon: ""Ballet is an international language - you can take ballet class anywhere and we are already united in our language,"" contends Kristine Elliott, former American Ballet Theatre soloist who has traveled to South Africa for the past 12 years to teach in the townships around Cape Town and Johannesburg. Several of the young students she has mentored have gone on to make extraordinary lives for themselves, both in South Africa and outside the country - chalking up more wins for diversity on ballet stages, and lifting themselves and their families out of poverty.

The indefatigable Elliott - who once performed on world stages with Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov, and whose leading roles include a memorable Giselle with Kevin McKenzie  (now artistic director of American Ballet Theatre) - created and ran the ballet program at Stanford University before founding the Gugulethu Project, in partnership with local dance schools in South Africa, and with the support of the Flora Family Foundation and others.   The Gugulethu Project (film by Ben Pierce): On her first trip to the country in 2004, Elliott taught for a program called Dance For All, which serves underprivileged youth in the South African townships, as well as for the University of Cape Town's School of Dance and the associated Cape Town City Ballet Company.
 On that trip, I witnessed firsthand how classical ballet training can bring about social change in a country where widespread poverty, violence and crime still pose serious threats to children and teens. The principles inherent in the study of ballet, including self-discipline, perseverance, respect for the self and the integrity of the body, are all transferable into the daily lives of the students who are fortunate enough to be involved in such training. - Kristine Elliott Elliott has since returned annually from her home base in northern California. Her Gugulethu Project sends talented South African students to study in the U.S. and brings American choreographers, teachers, and dancers to teach in South Africa. ""This is not just a mission to train young dancers - it's an exchange, a sharing of traditions. I teach, but I learn a great deal, too, from this project,"" says Elliott. She understands how arts education has been integral to the healing of South Africa post-apartheid. In addition to giving people a way of working through trauma, immersion in the arts has given impoverished children a way to imagine a better future. It has equipped them with life skills, and helped to direct them away from destructive behavior. With an assist from the Gugulethu Project, a handful of youngsters with innate talent and tenacity have broadened their horizons and forged fulfilling career paths. Seeing them succeed and, in many cases, return to their communities to act as mentors for the next generation of youngsters, has been an inspirational learning process, and one that I look forward to continuing. - Kristine Elliott

Each year the project's net has widened as more seek to be involved. Currently, Elliott is providing assistance for Bathembu Myira's new dance program in Khayelitsha. She is also helping to support one of the country's finest ballet teachers, who works in an area of extreme poverty, deep in the hinterlands. And as a faculty member in the LEAP (Liberal Education for Arts Professionals) program of St Mary's College, she is organizing next year's course that will bring a new set of dancers to teach in the townships, at partner schools. This year they include Zama Dance School in the township of Gugulethu, Dancescape in the township of Zolani, Cape Academy of Performing Arts (CAPA) in Cape Town, and the South African Education and Environment Project (SAEP) in the township of Philippi. Kristine Elliott's journey through the dance world has been an uncommon one indeed, and she has brought many along with her on this joyous and rewarding ride.

POLITICS,"This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com. To receive TomDispatch in your inbox three times a week, click here. By Tom Engelhardt [This essay is the introduction to Tom Engelhardt’s new book, A Nation Unmade by War, a Dispatch Book published by Haymarket Books.] As I was putting the finishing touches on my new book, the Costs of War Project at Brown University’s Watson Institute published an estimate of the taxpayer dollars that will have gone into America’s war on terror from September 12, 2001, through fiscal year 2018. That figure: a cool $5.6 trillion (including the future costs of caring for our war vets). On average, that’s at least $23,386 per taxpayer. Keep in mind that such figures, however eye-popping, are only the dollar costs of our wars. They don’t, for instance, include the psychic costs to the Americans mangled in one way or another in those never-ending conflicts. They don’t include the costs to this country’s infrastructure, which has been crumbling while taxpayer dollars flow copiously and in a remarkably ― in these years, almost uniquely ― bipartisan fashion into what’s still laughably called “national security.” That’s not, of course, what would make most of us more secure, but what would make them ― the denizens of the national security state ― ever more secure in Washington and elsewhere. We’re talking about the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. nuclear complex, and the rest of that state-within-a-state, including its many intelligence agencies and the warrior corporations that have, by now, been fused into that vast and vastly profitable interlocking structure. In reality, the costs of America’s wars, still spreading in the Trump era, are incalculable. Just look at photos of the cities of Ramadi or Mosul in Iraq, Raqqa or Aleppo in Syria, Sirte in Libya, or Marawi in the southern Philippines, all in ruins in the wake of the conflicts Washington set off in the post–9/11 years, and try to put a price on them. Those views of mile upon mile of rubble, often without a building still standing untouched, should take anyone’s breath away. Some of those cities may never be fully rebuilt. And how could you even begin to put a dollars-and-cents value on the larger human costs of those wars: the hundreds of thousands of dead? The tens of millions of people displaced in their own countries or sent as refugees fleeing across any border in sight? How could you factor in the way those masses of uprooted peoples of the Greater Middle East and Africa are unsettling other parts of the planet? Their presence (or more accurately a growing fear of it) has, for instance, helped fuel an expanding set of right-wing “populist” movements that threaten to tear Europe apart. And who could forget the role that those refugees ― or at least fantasy versions of them ― played in Donald Trump’s full-throated, successful pitch for the presidency? What, in the end, might be the cost of that? Opening the Gates of Hell America’s never-ending twenty-first-century conflicts were triggered by the decision of George W. Bush and his top officials to instantly define their response to attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center by a tiny group of jihadis as a “war”; then to proclaim it nothing short of a “Global War on Terror”; and finally to invade and occupy first Afghanistan and then Iraq, with dreams of dominating the Greater Middle East ― and ultimately the planet ― as no other imperial power had ever done. Their overwrought geopolitical fantasies and their sense that the U.S. military was a force capable of accomplishing anything they willed it to do launched a process that would cost this world of ours in ways that no one will ever be able to calculate. Who, for instance, could begin to put a price on the futures of the children whose lives, in the aftermath of those decisions, would be twisted and shrunk in ways frightening even to imagine? Who could tote up what it means for so many millions of this planet’s young to be deprived of homes, parents, educations ― of anything, in fact, approximating the sort of stability that might lead to a future worth imagining? Though few may remember it, I’ve never forgotten the 2002 warning issued by Amr Moussa, then head of the Arab League. An invasion of Iraq would, he predicted that September, “open the gates of hell.” Two years later, in the wake of the actual invasion and the U.S. occupation of that country, he altered his comment slightly. “The gates of hell,” he said, “are open in Iraq.” His assessment has proven unbearably prescient ― and one not only applicable to Iraq. Fourteen years after that invasion, we should all now be in some kind of mourning for a world that won’t ever be. It wasn’t just the US military that, in the spring of 2003, passed through those gates to hell. In our own way, we all did. Otherwise, Donald Trump wouldn’t have become president. I don’t claim to be an expert on hell. I have no idea exactly what circle of it we’re now in, but I do know one thing: we are there. The Infrastructure of a Garrison State If I could bring my parents back from the dead right now, I know that this country in its present state would boggle their minds. They wouldn’t recognize it. If I were to tell them, for instance, that just three men ― Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Warren Buffett ― now possess as much wealth as the bottom half of the US population, of 160 million Americans, they would never believe me. How, for instance, could I begin to explain to them the ways in which, in these years, money flowed ever upward into the pockets of the immensely wealthy and then down again into what became one-percent elections that would finally ensconce a billionaire and his family in the White House? How would I explain to them that, while leading congressional Democrats and Republicans couldn’t say often enough that this country was uniquely greater than any that ever existed, none of them could find the funds ― some $5.6 trillion for starters ― necessary for our roads, dams, bridges, tunnels and other crucial infrastructure? This on a planet where what the news likes to call “extreme weather” is increasingly wreaking havoc on that same infrastructure. My parents wouldn’t have thought such things possible. Not in America. And somehow I’d have to explain to them that they had returned to a nation which, though few Americans realize it, has increasingly been unmade by war ― by the conflicts Washington’s war on terror triggered that have now morphed into the wars of so many and have, in the process, changed us. Such conflicts on the global frontiers have a tendency to come home in ways that can be hard to track or pin down. After all, unlike those cities in the Greater Middle East, ours aren’t yet in ruins ― though some of them may be heading in that direction, even if in slow motion. This country is, at least theoretically, still near the height of its imperial power, still the wealthiest nation on the planet. And yet it should be clear enough by now that we’ve crippled not just other nations but ourselves in ways that I suspect ― though I’ve tried over these years to absorb and record them as best I could ― we can still barely see or grasp. In my new book, A Nation Unmade by War, the focus is on a country increasingly unsettled and transformed by spreading wars to which most of its citizens were, at best, only half paying attention. Certainly, Trump’s election was a sign of how an American sense of decline had already come home to roost in the era of the rise of the national security state (and little else). Though it’s not something normally said here, to my mind President Trump should be considered part of the costs of those wars come home. Without the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and what followed, I doubt he would have been imaginable as anything but the host of a reality TV show or the owner of a series of failed casinos. Nor would the garrison-state version of Washington he now occupies be conceivable, nor the generals of our disastrous wars whom he’s surrounded himself with, nor the growth of a surveillance state that would have staggered George Orwell. The Makings of a Blowback Machine It took Donald Trump ― give him credit where it’s due ― to make us begin to grasp that we were living in a different and devolving world. And none of this would have been imaginable if, in the aftermath of 9/11, George W. Bush, Dick Cheney & Co. hadn’t felt the urge to launch the wars that led us through those gates of hell. Their soaring geopolitical dreams of global domination proved to be nightmares of the first order. They imagined a planet unlike any in the previous half millennium of imperial history, in which a single power would basically dominate everything until the end of time. They imagined, that is, the sort of world that, in Hollywood, had been associated only with the most malign of evil characters. And here was the result of their conceptual overreach: never, it could be argued, has a great power still in its imperial prime proven quite so incapable of applying its military and political might in a way that would advance its aims. It’s a strange fact of this century that the U.S. military has been deployed across vast swaths of the planet and somehow, again and again, has found itself overmatched by underwhelming enemy forces and incapable of producing any results other than destruction and further fragmentation. And all of this occurred at the moment when the planet most needed a new kind of knitting together, at the moment when humanity’s future was at stake in ways previously unimaginable, thanks to its still-increasing use of fossil fuels. In the end, the last empire may prove to be an empire of nothing at all ― a grim possibility which has been a focus of TomDispatch, the website I’ve run since November 2002. Of course, when you write pieces every couple of weeks for years on end, it would be surprising if you didn’t repeat yourself. The real repetitiousness, however, wasn’t at TomDispatch. It was in Washington. The only thing our leaders and generals have seemed capable of doing, starting from the day after the 9/11 attacks, is more or less the same thing with the same dismal results, again and again. The U.S. military and the national security state that those wars emboldened have become, in effect ― and with a bow to the late Chalmers Johnson (a TomDispatch stalwart and a man who knew the gates of hell when he saw them) ― a staggeringly well-funded blowback machine. In all these years, while three administrations pursued the spreading war on terror, America’s conflicts in distant lands were largely afterthoughts to its citizenry. Despite the largest demonstrations in history aimed at stopping a war before it began, once the invasion of Iraq occurred, the protests died out and, ever since, Americans have generally ignored their country’s wars, even as the blowback began. Someday, they will have no choice but to pay attention.

It's a simple gesture. I'm painting them so they will not disappear. The almost performative extension of this project has been the many hours I spend hearing each of their different and powerful perspectives.

Slabs of paint are suffocating violation, protective barrier and teasing veil. These are not linear narratives the way cubist space was not linear. Quantum physicists have proved it but artist have always known it. Particles exist in multiple places at once. Truth is not a fixed point. Artists are the guardians of the freedom to be broken.

BUSINESS,"Susan Richardson, a Bank of America foreclosure victim, certainly hopes so. With bated breath she’s following a drama currently playing out in a California bankruptcy court. “Battle-fatigued demoralization” is how Judge Christopher Klein described the condition of Erik and Renee Sundquist when he fined Bank of America a sweet $45 million for having illegally foreclosed on their home in Lincoln, California. The couple had been in the trenches for more than eight years doing battle with the same Mega-Bank that had led thousands of homeowners down a primrose path to foreclosure. It was all done via smoke and mirrors — a very tricky-dicky maneuver — and the spiel to homeowners desperate for modifications went like this: stop paying your monthly loan payments, don’t send us any more checks, then we’ll consider your for mod. Counter-intuitive, yes, but the Sundquists hoping for a more affordable monthly nut during hard economic times took the bait (they had previously been up-to-date with payments). They quickly found that bait turned into bait and switch. Like thousands of others they fell victim to what’s known as “dual tracking.” On one hand Bank of America officials continued to encourage the couple to apply for a modification — some 20 applications were fielded by the Sundquists — but with a sleight of the other hand, Bank of America was quietly rolling out foreclosure’s red carpet. Eventually, the bank got what it wanted: the Sundquist’s home, and all the couple got was agita rising to the level of PTSD. Erik Sundquist was sent packing to the hospital with a stress-related heart condition. Renee Sundquist attempted suicide. Judge Klein, reviewing the case, found that the stream of applications proffered by the Sundquists were “routinely either lost or declared insufficient, or incomplete or stale or in need of resubmission or denied without comprehensible explanation.” In the wake of 2008’s sub-prime chaos homeowners across the country have been wrung through the same wringer as the Sundquists; squeezed out of home and hearth and left out to dry. Count some seventeen million victims. Bereft of cash and without inclination to challenge Big Boy Bankers in a rigged court system (think Florida’s infamous “rocket dockets”: a foreclosure conveyor belt designed to move homeowners out with alacrity). For those with a touch of amnesia let me offer up 99 Homes, the absolutely brilliant 2015 flic, starring Andrew Garfield, that detailed the human tragedy wrought in one epicenters of the housing crisis: Florida Florida is also where Susan Richardson calls home and her story follows the same track as the Sundquists. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina and Dennis — followed by the tragic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico — Florida’s real estate took a nose-dive and wiped away any hope that Susan could use the equity in her home to purchase a smaller house for cash. The next best option was cutting her monthly mortgage nut; a request she made to the bank in 2010. The powers-that-be told her she’d have to be at least three months in arrears to qualify for a government sponsored HAMP modification. Uncomfortable with this arrangement she made another inquiry to Bank of America’s CEO, Brian Moynihan, and was instructed by his office to pay a reduced monthly amount and submit HAMP applications (some forty pages in length). After enduring sixteen months of Kafkaesque insanity her check was refused. She was also denied a modification. Welcome to Foreclosure Land... What’s most disconcerting about tip toeing through this rough terrain is that when you’ve got stage 4 lung cancer — forced to take sips of oxygen when stressed out, which, for Susan, is often — the fight becomes Sisyphean in nature. Susan despite her illness remained driven.  Part of her strategy was to write long imploring letters to the aforementioned Brian Moynihan hoping he’d cast a sympathetic eye on her predicament and fix the disconnects. Nice try but the letters fell on very deaf ears. She asked me if I might publish one of her pieces. I told her, honestly, there’s little chance that any posted letter would catch Moynihan’s eye. Foreclosure victims often resort to personal pleas to their victimizers and nearly all of them wind up in the circular files next to the corporate shredder. Even if this heartless sot read it, I told her, there was zilch chance that it would impact his world view; one which he detailed in a 2011 CNBC interview with supremely unpleasant CNBC pundit Larry Kudlow. With Moynihan’s nodding assent Kudlow asserted a win/lose nostrum held by most in the mortgage industry A recommendation from a friend, Isabel Santamaria, put Susan in contact with lawyer Rich Kalinoski (Isabel, a Florida mother with two autistic children, has her own horrid Bank of America tale to tell). Taking on Susan’s case with a crusader’s enthusiasm — a sentiment shared by a growing number of foreclosure-fighting lawyers — he’s on a legal mission to expose the kinds of shenanigans that remain an active legacy of Wall Street’s subprime slash and burn campaigns; namely, the unabated use of patently fraudulent documents. Much of this came to light during 2010’s well-publicized revelations of robo-signing and as Rich points out this remains a critical problem when defending foreclosure victims. In layman’s terms even if a defendant manages to get a dismissal often it will be “without prejudice” — a fancy way of saying that the action can again be brought at a later date — leaving already victimized defendants feeling as if they’re spinning around in a clothes dryer like some hazed fraternity initiate. Storied bankruptcy attorney, Linda Tirelli, highlighted the on-going use of fraudulent foreclosure documents in a recent piece of mine: Judge Klein’s decision on behalf of the Sundquists seems to further justification for the use of bankruptcy courts in taking on Wall Street but in an ironic twist his providing a confidentiality component has raised objections by the other beneficiaries of the proposed $45 million settlement. Five California law schools and two consumer groups claim confidentiality gives succor to a financial institution whose bad behavior can continue to remain hidden from prying eyes. Unfortunately, Judge Klein now faces a Hobson’s choice in trying to do the right thing by the Sundquists who stand to collect a reported $6 million dollar chunk of the settlement. No surprise: Bank of America is on-board with the confidentiality agreement. So, what other avenues exist for a legal redress of homeowner’s grievances? Well there’s always the class action route although many consumer advocates claim that this generally enriches law firms and not members of the “class.” My personal favorite is RICO: short for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations. First employed as a legal tool to dismember the mob this federal statute does have sharp enough teeth to tear away at another alleged criminal enterprise: Mega-Banks. In 2012 I wrote a piece for American Banker, Will R-I-C-O Spell ‘Relief’ for B of A Mortgage Borrowers? featuring the informed opinion of some consumer lawyers that RICO (which has both a criminal and civil component) should have taken on Bank of America after the acquisition of Angelo Mozilo’s Countrywide Financial; an acquisition that brought with it a surfeit of violations of securities and consumer protection laws (ignored, thanks in great part, to the inaction of the Obama-era Department of Justice). Is it possible that RICO — like the proverbial cavalry — might come riding to the homeowner’s rescue? In Susan Richardson’s case any legal relief can’t come soon enough.

BUSINESS,"This tip for improving your performance is the most simple and straightforward method I’ve provided thus far. For many people, this tip has the potential to have a bigger impact than any other single action. The catch? You have to cut down on caffeine, and as any caffeine drinker can attest, this is easier said than done. For those who aren’t aware, the ability to manage your emotions and remain calm under pressure has a direct link to your performance. TalentSmart has conducted research with more than a million people, and we’ve found that 90 percent of top performers are high in emotional intelligence. These individuals are skilled at managing their emotions (even in times of high stress) in order to remain calm and in control. The Good: Isn’t Really Good  Most people start drinking caffeine because it makes them feel more alert and improves their mood. Many studies suggest that caffeine actually improves cognitive task performance (memory, attention span, etc.) in the short-term. Unfortunately, these studies fail to consider the participants’ caffeine habits. New research from Johns Hopkins Medical School shows that performance increases due to caffeine intake are the result of caffeine drinkers experiencing a short-term reversal of caffeine withdrawal. By controlling for caffeine use in study participants, John Hopkins researchers found that caffeine-related performance improvement is nonexistent without caffeine withdrawal. In essence, coming off caffeine reduces your cognitive performance and has a negative impact on your mood. The only way to get back to normal is to drink caffeine, and when you do drink it, you feel like it’s taking you to new heights. In reality, the caffeine is just taking your performance back to normal for a short period. The Bad: Adrenaline Drinking caffeine triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline is the source of the “fight or flight” response, a survival mechanism that forces you to stand up and fight or run for the hills when faced with a threat. The fight-or-flight mechanism sidesteps rational thinking in favor of a faster response. This is great when a bear is chasing you, but not so great when you’re responding to a curt email. When caffeine puts your brain and body into this hyper-aroused state, your emotions overrun your behavior. Irritability and anxiety are the most commonly seen emotional effects of caffeine, but caffeine enables all of your emotions to take charge. The negative effects of a caffeine-generated adrenaline surge are not just behavioral. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that large doses of caffeine raise blood pressure, stimulate the heart, and produce rapid shallow breathing, which readers of Emotional Intelligence 2.0 know deprives the brain of the oxygen needed to keep your thinking calm and rational. The Ugly: Sleep When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, shuffling through the day’s memories and storing or discarding them (which causes dreams), so that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your self-control, focus, memory, and information processing speed are all reduced when you don’t get enough—or the right kind—of sleep. Your brain is very fickle when it comes to sleep. For you to wake up feeling rested, your brain needs to move through an elaborate series of cycles. You can help this process along and improve the quality of your sleep by reducing your caffeine intake. Here’s why you’ll want to: caffeine has a six-hour half-life, which means it takes a full twenty-four hours to work its way out of your system. Have a cup of joe at eight a.m., and you’ll still have 25 percent of the caffeine in your body at eight p.m. Anything you drink after noon will still be at 50 percent strength at bedtime. Any caffeine in your bloodstream—with the negative effects increasing with the dose—makes it harder to fall asleep. When you do finally fall asleep, the worst is yet to come. Caffeine disrupts the quality of your sleep by reducing rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the deep sleep when your body recuperates and processes emotions. When caffeine disrupts your sleep, you wake up the next day with an emotional handicap. You’re naturally going to be inclined to grab a cup of coffee or an energy drink to try to make yourself feel better. The caffeine produces surges of adrenaline, which further your emotional handicap. Caffeine and lack of sleep leave you feeling tired in the afternoon, so you drink more caffeine, which leaves even more of it in your bloodstream at bedtime. Caffeine very quickly creates a vicious cycle. Withdrawal Like any stimulant, caffeine is physiologically and psychologically addictive. If you do choose to lower your caffeine intake, you should do so slowly under the guidance of a qualified medical professional. The researchers at Johns Hopkins found that caffeine withdrawal causes headache, fatigue, sleepiness, and difficulty concentrating. Some people report feeling flu-like symptoms, depression, and anxiety after reducing intake by as little as one cup a day. Slowly tapering your caffeine dosage each day can greatly reduce these withdrawal symptoms. Want to learn more? Consider TalentSmart’s emotional intelligence certification program."
BUSINESS," (Photo by WendellandCarolyn/iStock)  By Paul Feldman, FairWarning Can a used car be marketed as “safe” or “certified” even if it has defective air bags, a faulty ignition switch or other potentially lethal problems? Yes, so long as the used car dealer discloses that the vehicle may be subject to a pending safety recall. That stance, taken by the Federal Trade Commission, is at the heart of a recent legal settlement with General Motors and two used car dealers over deceptive advertising practices. But it is now being put to the test in a federal court in Washington, D.C., by auto safety activists. The safety groups contended in legal papers filed Friday that the settlement places unaware car buyers, their passengers and others at “the risk of injury or death caused by the defective vehicles.” In essence, the concern is that buyers will have a false sense of security if a car is described as safe and won’t take care of the defect that prompted the recall. ‘Extremely detrimental’  “The sale of ‘certified’ used cars as ‘safe,’ ‘repaired for safety issues,’ or ‘subject to a rigorous inspection,’ when such vehicles are in fact not safe because they are the subject of pending safety recalls, is extremely detrimental to consumers who buy used cars—particularly poor, unsophisticated, and non-English speaking consumers,” declared the Center for Auto Safety and other safety groups involved in the case. For many years auto manufacturers have been forbidden from selling new cars with open safety recalls. And in 2016, a federal law was enacted banning car rental agencies from offering vehicles still the subject of a recall. The used car market, however, has no such restrictions. Activists’ concerns about the potential for abuse have mounted amid the discovery of major defects. The high-profile Takata airbag recall accounts for at least 29 million of the more than 63 million vehicles nationwide with open recalls. The issue came to a head when the FTC announced the recent settlement. According to the agency, the move was aimed at halting false or misleading sales practices in which used cars with open recalls were advertised as having undergone “172-point inspection and reconditioning,” an “exhaustive 160-checkpoint Quality Assurance Inspection,” or a “rigorous and extensive inspection.” Under the consent order, the agency said dealers who market a vehicle as safe must have completed repairs on recall issues or disclosed clearly that the vehicle remains subject to an open recall. That, however, can amount to a “death sentence” for used car buyers who unwittingly purchase vehicles with unrepaired recalls, while also posing a direct threat to others on the road, said Rosemary Shahan, founder of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, one of the advocacy groups involved in the new legal challenge. The suit, which was filed last month, cites recalls such as the ones involving Takata air bag inflators, which have been deemed responsible for at least 11 deaths and 180 injuries. The suit also cites recalls involving exploding gas tanks, sticking accelerators and faulty steering, brakes and axles. The advocacy groups, along with several members of Congress, asked the FTC to reconsider its action before it became final in December. “There is no question that any vehicle with an outstanding recall is an unsafe vehicle,” stated a letter from five U.S. senators, including Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat. “A certified used vehicle with an unrepaired safety recall is inherently misleading.” But the agency resisted. In fact, the FTC announced that it had reached a similar settlement with CarMax, the nation’s largest user car dealer, and two more major used car retailers that weren’t included in the agreement with GM. Although the second settlement is yet to be finalized, it highlights the concerns of safety groups that the approach will become the industry standard. No standing to sue The FTC, in legal papers filed March 17, argued that the consumer groups have no standing to take the matter to court, and that in any case, the agency’s decision is not subject to such review. Moreover, government attorneys contended, if the FTC order were vacated, that would “simply allow these companies to unlawfully represent their cars as safe or rigorously inspected without clearly disclosing open recalls.” Further complicating matters is that in some of the largest recalls, such as the airbag inflator case, adequate replacement parts are often unavailable for many months. That could hurt used car dealers stuck with lots of defective cars. But Michael Brooks of the Center for Auto Safety says the FTC’s stance has put dealers who handle recall repairs before offering their cars for sale at an economic disadvantage and made matters “far too confusing to car buyers.” “If dealers insist on selling vehicles with open recalls,” Brooks said, “they should sell them as part of their normal used car fleet, with no advertising or representations that would suggest to car buyers that the vehicles are safe.” This story was reported by FairWarning (www.fairwarning.org), a nonprofit news organization based in Pasadena, Calif., that focuses on public health, consumer and environmental issues. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM ** 1/2 out of ****
PEARL THEATRE COMPANY You'll find more shadows than light in this moody, melancholy Midsummer Night's Dream. You'll also find a menagerie of animals: dogs and wolves and owls and birds and countless other creatures caw and growl and hoot and stomp their way through a forest where young lovers are ensnared and set free, not wiser but certainly warier.  And you'll find many, many ideas -- jumpsuit costumes and a vague suggestion of a set that look like leftovers from Logan's Run, musical references that span popular culture, a stage floor filled with pebbles that a small child leaving the theater rightly said with astonishment was just like a playground at her school and more. Much more.  Director Eric Tucker has 37 ideas for every show; while all of them may be good, they are not necessarily all good at the same time in the same production. This is not an ideal introduction to Shakespeare's messy but enduring comedy. Yet for those who know it well, some new notes are struck and that's nothing to pass over lightly. Though darkness prevails in a way, the playful tone of the evening begins at the start, when Pearl's marvelous player Sean McNall puckishly announces that ""Tonight's performance of Uncle Vanya is about to begin..."" A slightly bewildered audience was immediately put off kilter. Indeed, this co-production between Pearl and Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival was perhaps especially challenging for subscribers more used to dependably traditional Shavian productions by the excellent Pearl repertory, as opposed to somewhat avant-garde deconstructions. Nonetheless, we dove into the deep end, with concrete walls for a backdrop and that playful pit of a stage floor filled with pebbles that emphasized the free spirited nature of the acting on display. Performers barked and trotted on all fours, fused into a clump of humanity, somehow disentangled themselves and then were drawn ineluctably back together again, all the while giving us the story we know so well.  Two young lovers are denied the possibility of happiness by the woman's implacable father. He insists she marry the young man he prefers instead. Rather than marrying a man she doesn't love or face death by royal decree or worse (a nunnery!), the two meet in the forest and plan to spirit away to another land. She is pursued by the man betrothed to her by her apparently bi-curious father (one idea of many that go nowhere) while that man in turn is pursued by another young woman who adores him with slavish -- and thus unwelcome -- devotion. In the forest, all four would-be lovers are set upon by fairies who delight in toying with the vagaries of love.  Wandering about this rather crowded forest we also find some local workers who fancy themselves a troupe of actors. They are rehearsing a play in hopes of performing it for the king during his wedding nuptials. Thus they may curry favor and perhaps even make their (modest) fortune. Fairies being fairies, the actors too are set upon. A full-of-himself lead player named Bottom is turned into a genuine ass by the fairy Puck. Bottom is then paired off with the magicked fairy queen who has earned her husband's wrath and thus this scornful prank.  All will be set aright by the end, but not without a little wear and tear on the heart. This isn't the first Dream to play more like a nightmare. But the shadows do prove Tucker's most memorable gambit. While most tech elements are minimal and add even less, the lighting is exceptional. (Credit to The Lighting Syndicate with assistant lighting designer Leslie Smith.) The switch to fairy land is ominous and beguiling while the late night confusion where lovers wander aimlessly in the dark is especially vivid. These fairies are dangerous, as is falling in and out of love. Every time someone is bewitched into one false love or another, their bodies convulse as if their very soul were being plucked out. (I'm less certain why McNall collapses every once in a while, only to be revived with a comforting word.) The visual flair of director Tucker is especially strong. His ability to move the actors in concert, to create absurdist moments that feel natural and inevitable (such as scenes where the actors deliver their lines entangled in a giant ball of humanity) are consistently successful.  And Tucker's cast is a true ensemble, working as one. Joey Parsons is convincing as both a delightful wall and an imperious fairy queen. Nance Williamson works equally well as a besotted would-be lover and a stone-faced monarch. Mark Bedard charms as a ""dude"" of a lover and a squeaky-voiced mechanical and the vengeful fairy king. Sean McNall remains the Pearl of great price, a marvelous actor of endless empathy who imbues each character he plays with full-bodied humanity. If Jason O'Connell runs rampant as Puck and Bottom (doing everything from wrestling with himself to an overly extended Brando imitation), the fault lies with the director, not him. Tucker has produced some of my favorite theater of the last few years, including Bedlam's Twelfth Night take dubbed What You Will earlier this year and a Sense And Sensibility, which is making a welcome return soon. If he has a weakness, it is embracing all ideas, whether or not they serve the particular production at hand. Stronger editing will serve him better in the future.  Laughs are not the point here so when the shadows are darker, the emotions should run deep. But we feel little when lovers are torn apart and even less when they are reunited. And you know a Midsummer is not wholly successful when you worry about the drawn-out ending -- with its goofy play within a play -- even before it's begun.  Still, the cast is energetic and winning and some rewards are earned. Puck is a quietly menacing figure (and would be even more so if the quiet were emphasized). Bottom's metamorphosis into an ass is poignant and scary instead of silly. It feels more akin to the frightening transformation of those bad little boys in Pinocchio rather than the cheap laughs it is usually played for.  Nonetheless many ideas prove fleeting, transitory. That fey father? The random snippets of pop culture and anachronistic touches like an elevator ride? Those puzzling costumes? Too often they flash into view then dissipate in a puff of smoke, like fairy lights that glow alluringly and promise much but can never quite be grasped. THEATER OF 2015 Honeymoon In Vegas **

ARTS & CULTURE,"Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay had to get no-nonsense with a contestant on Monday night, after Episode 2 of Season 13 revealed one suitor had been hiding a girlfriend. Teasers made clear that the episode’s final date, a group outing to play basketball with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, would turn dramatic for all the wrong reasons when a young woman showed up claiming one of the bachelors had been dating her until his departure ― and never broke up with her. The cad turns out to be DeMario, a contestant who first appeared on “After the Final Rose” suggesting that he and Rachel elope to Vegas on the spot. The woman who crashed the episode claimed he dated her for seven months, then simply stopped texting her three days before he met Rachel on the “ATFR” special. “He still has keys to my place,” she told the shocked Bachelorette. Many viewers have been watching DeMario skeptically after Rachel’s friend Whitney Fransway, a fellow “Bachelor” alum, warned her on the premiere that the gentleman might not have the best intentions. But Rachel seemed torn between skepticism at his cockiness and attraction to his clever references and serious good looks. Once his ex showed up on the scene, however, Rachel was all business. Like a good attorney, she gave DeMario a chance to defend himself as he proceeded to destroy his own case. First pretending to have never met the woman, he then admitted they’d been involved. He denied ever having had keys to her place, then admitted he did ― but claimed to have mailed them back to her. (His ex hilariously shot down this claim, retorting, “I check my mailbox EVERY DAY!”)  “I’m not here to get played,” Rachel finally snapped. “So I’m gonna need you to get the fuck out.” And with that, DeMario’s stint on “The Bachelorette” came to a humiliating end ― or did it? The episode ends with a cliffhanger, as he returns to the mansion to interrupt the cocktail party and plead his case. It’s tough to imagine this womanizer getting another shot after Rachel’s tough-but-fair dismissal. But no matter what happens, we’ll always have that truly iconic send-off.

News published Monday. “It was just me and [my dog] Tatiana and now it’s cool, you got someone to go through life with together that you love and you want to be partnered up with.”  Just after tying the knot, the comedian revealed she also loved every time Fischer called her his “wife.” “I’m a wife as hell. But it’s still like, a novelty,” Schumer said on Nikki Glaser’s SiriusXM show in late February. “Somebody went to sit next to [Chris] and he’s like, ‘My wife is sitting here,’ and then I got back and he was excited to tell me that he said that. I just have been really overusing it to a degree that’s insane. Like, when it’s completely uncalled for.”  Schumer and Fischer got married in front of 80 friends and family in February, just a few days after going public with their relationship. The two were first linked together back in November.  A post shared by @amyschumer on Feb 15, 2018 at 10:53am PST David Spade, Larry David, Jennifer Aniston and Jennifer Lawrence were just a few of the reported guests at the secret star-studded affair, which took place in Malibu. Lawrence said that she was “sobbing” at the wedding in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. “It was beautiful,” the actress said. “It was very sudden, but it was, I was sobbing the whole ― his vows were stunning. It’s when two people really love each other and they really mean it, it shows, and it was a beautiful ceremony and an amazing time. I couldn’t be happier for them.” As for those who were wondering why Schumer and Fischer got married so fast, the comedian explained in her vows that it was “because I truly cannot wait another second to be your wife. I love you.”   A post shared by @amyschumer on Feb 28, 2018 at 11:48am PST How cute are these two?  A post shared by @amyschumer on Apr 13, 2018 at 3:51am PDT"
ARTS & CULTURE,"Museums around the country have responded in big and small ways to President Donald Trump’s highly contested travel ban, which bars immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations and indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees from entering the U.S.  The Davis Museum at Wellesley College in Massachusetts is just the latest. On Wednesday, the museum announced that it will be de-installing or shrouding all artwork by immigrants, as well as any art given to the museum by immigrants. The decision to remove the work is meant “to highlight the invaluable contributions that immigrants from all over the world have made on our society and culture,” the museum wrote in a press statement. Echoing the American Association of Museum Director’s statement on Trump’s executive order, the Davis Museum describes the deinstallation ― dubbed “Art-Less” ― as a “protest” that will take place from Thursday, Feb. 16, until Tuesday, Feb. 21. The Davis Museum will be taking down or hiding 120 works of art in total, including paintings, bronze and wood sculptures and ceremonial masks from European, American, African, contemporary and modern collections. The initiative will amount to a censoring of 20 percent of the objects on view in the Museum’s permanent collections galleries. The impact of “Art-Less” on the African galleries will be particularly stark ― nearly 80 percent of the galleries’ objects were donated by the Klejman family, who immigrated to the U.S. from Poland after World War II. “Every permanent collections gallery will be affected by the subtraction of works created by or given to the Museum by an immigrant to the United States,” Claire Whitner, assistant director of curatorial affairs and senior curator of collections, explained in the statement. The museum will note the removal or obfuscation of works with labels that read “made by an immigrant” or “given by an immigrant.” (Work that cannot be removed will also be draped in black cloth.) In fact, the Davis encourages other “sympathetic institutions” to download the labels in an effort to broaden the “Art-Less” initiative.  One of the “subtracted” works will be a recognizable portrait of George Washington that was painted by the Swedish-born artist Adolf Ulrik Wertmüller. Wertmüller immigrated to the U.S. in the 1790s. His oil painting was given to the Davis Museum by the Munn family, who also emigrated from Sweden after World War II.  The decision to remove work from its collection might seem counterproductive to some, but the Davis Museum seems to believe that the temporary absence of art will highlight how reliant art museums are on immigrants artists and benefactors.  The “Art-Less” protest comes after the Museum of Modern Art’s decision to hang more art by artists from Muslim-majority nations on its walls. MoMA’s Chief Curator of Drawings and Prints Christophe Cherix described the endeavor as a “clear reaction” to Trump’s travel ban that was meant to express “solidarity with artists from different countries.” The Museum of the City of New York has similarly taken action, staging an exhibition called “Muslim in New York” that pays tribute to the legacy of Muslim life in the city’s five boroughs."
BUSINESS,"First Toys R Us, and now Claire’s. Mainstay institutions within malls across America are entering a new chapter in life: bankruptcy.  Cheap jewelry giant Claire’s filed for Chapter 11 on Monday, hoping to rid itself of substantial debt, the company announced. Claire’s maintained that it was approaching the bankruptcy filing from a position of strength, using Chapter 11 to restructure its budget sheet, not its operations. So jewelry fans and ear-piercing enthusiasts, fear not! Claire’s plans to continue its store operations per usual throughout the Chapter 11 process. And the U.S. bankruptcy filing pertains only to Claire’s stores in America, not the company’s international subsidiaries. Still, Claire’s, which says it’s pierced over 100 million ears worldwide, plans to close some underperforming stores and renegotiate leases, according to The New York Times. The company expects to emerge from bankruptcy in September 2018 with $1.9 billion less in debt.  While mall traffic has been declining over the years with the rise of online shopping, Claire’s says its beloved ear-piercing service is internet-proof since it cannot be replicated on the web. The company says it pierced 3.5 million ears in the U.S. last year. News of Claire’s Chapter 11 filing comes on the heels of reports that fellow mall tenant Toys R Us may close all of its operations in America, which could affect roughly 33,000 U.S. workers. Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy in September."
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― The most conservative Republicans in Congress say they won’t vote for food stamp cuts they support unless party leadership gives them what they want on immigration, potentially holding up the farm bill this week.  “We don’t have an agreement,” House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told reporters Thursday after coming out of a meeting with his conservative group. Since Democrats seem almost unanimously against the farm bill, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) needs most Republicans to support it. And with roughly a dozen moderates already stating their opposition to the farm bill, the opposition of another dozen to two-dozen conservatives in the Freedom Caucus would almost certainly sink the farm bill.  With such significant opposition, House GOP leaders may decide to postpone a vote and send members home for the week, but House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Thursday the House would move forward with a Friday vote. Meadows wants Ryan’s assurance of a vote on an immigration bill by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) that would strictly limit legal immigration and ramp up deportations. The Freedom Caucus is also now working with moderates on a sort of compromise bill that would stick to President Donald Trump’s “four pillars” on an immigration bill: a wall, scaling back family migration, ending the visa lottery program and a fix for immigrants covered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. “We think it’s important we have a vote on Goodlatte and at this point, we were not able to convince any of our members to go from ‘no’ to ‘yes’ on the farm bill,” Meadows said. Moderate Republicans and Democrats are trying to force a vote on a separate immigration bill through a parliamentary maneuver known as a “discharge petition,” which can bring legislation to the floor of the House against the wishes of party leaders. Moderates want protected legal status for Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Meadows said he believed Republicans could quickly reach a consensus on immigration that may even attract Democrats, but he and other conservatives in the Freedom Caucus want to use their leverage on the farm bill to make sure leaders work toward an immigration agreement before a discharge petition addressing DACA ripens by the end of June. With farm subsidy programs expiring at the end of September, the Freedom Caucus believes the farm bill is the only must-pass piece of legislation they can use to extract concessions on immigration, which they believe is a related issue to the farm bill anyway. (Most of the spending in the farm bill goes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, which serves 40 million Americans. Those benefits would not stop being issued even if authorization expires, though some farm programs would be affected.)  Meadows declined to name a specific number of Freedom Caucus members who remain opposed to the bill, but another Freedom Caucus member told HuffPost they had at least 18 members willing to hold up the farm bill. Republicans had planned to vote on the farm bill Friday, but if it clearly lacks support that vote could be in doubt. Meadows said he’s not in a hurry.  “We don’t have an impending deadline for the farm bill,” he said. “It doesn’t expire until September.”  Whatever the House passes would have to be merged with a separate farm bill from the Senate, which has not yet been released.  Former Agriculture Committee chairman Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), who saw his own farm bill hijacked on the House floor in 2013, said he thought linking the bill to immigration wouldn’t be a good way to pass the legislation.  “I believe that is just a load too heavy for the farm bill to carry,” Lucas said."

The self-styled “greatest living rock star on the planet” set the social media platform abuzz Tuesday with the following message: 2024 On Monday, he also tweeted but then deleted a photo featuring this “Keep America Great” poster, with the hashtag #Kanye2024, according to NME, a British music journalism outlet. Of course, West announcing a presidential run is nothing new. In 2015, he used his MTV Video Music Awards speech to tout a 2020 shot at the White House. He later revised that time frame following Donald Trump’s 2016 election victory and the pair’s subsequent meeting in Trump Tower during which West talked with the president-elect about schools and violence in Chicago. “I feel it is important to have a direct line of communication with our future president if we truly want change,” West tweeted at the time. It’s unclear with which political party, if any, West would seek candidacy. But in 2016, he said he’d have voted for Trump had he cast a ballot. And over the weekend, West expressed his admiration for conservative commentator Candace Owens. Unsurprisingly, West’s latest tweet has prompted plenty of responses online: Is this the official announcement for running? https://t.co/6vRlkMrRmP  pic.twitter.com/CRFFUB79jJ this better be the last 4 digits of Kanye’s SSN https://t.co/nzDbMrFhe4 Could you imagine? pic.twitter.com/I57atThpRg let’s be practical here https://t.co/7cksH3Vevj West’s wife (and potential future first lady) Kim Kardashian is yet to comment on his post."
POLITICS,"Rex Tillerson came precipitously close to criticizing his former boss Wednesday. In a commencement speech at Virginia Military Institute, the camera-shy former secretary of state gave his most public remarks since President Donald Trump ousted him from the White House in March.  “As I reflect upon the state of American democracy,” he told the Class of 2018, “I observe a growing crisis in ethics and integrity.” Tillerson’s emphasis on integrity echoed his parting words to colleagues at the State Department in March. Then he went even further: “If our leaders seek to conceal the truth, or we as people become accepting of alternative realities that are no longer grounded in facts, then we as American citizens are on a pathway to relinquishing our freedom.” Tillerson’s time in Trump administration was marked by tension. He reportedly called the president a “moron” eight months before he was fired and replaced by then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo. But the oil industry veteran has yet to directly criticize Trump. His speech, which began with a discussion on the globalized economy and stressed “the value of friends and allies,” is the closest he has come to attacking Trump’s rhetoric and “America First” policy. Tillerson’s hands are hardly clean on the subject of “friends and allies.” He earned a fortune as CEO of ExxonMobil, the oil behemoth that made common cause with despots (and helped push the climate toward catastrophe). He spent his tenure as secretary of state gutting America’s diplomatic corps.  His remarks on truth and fact appeared to be a comment on Trump’s frequent use of lies, half-truths or exaggerations. A commitment to facts “binds us to other like-minded democratic nations,” he said, distinguishing America from “nondemocratic” countries such as Russia. Tillerson said it’s the responsibility of all Americans to recognize “what truth is and is not,” and “what a fact is and is not.” Citizens must also demand the country’s future be “fact-based, not based on wishful thinking, not hoped-for outcomes made in shallow promises, but with a clear-eyed view of the facts as they are and guided by the truth that will set us free to seek solutions to our most daunting challenges,” he said. “When we as people, a free people, go wobbly on the truth ― even on what seem the most trivial of matters ― we go wobbly on America.” Ending on a dark note, he said that departing from the truth could mean “American democracy as we know it is entering its twilight years.” Watch Tillerson’s full speech below. "
ENTERTAINMENT,"Love actually turned to matrimony for Hugh Grant. The 57-year-old actor married his longtime girlfriend, Anna Eberstein, in London on Friday, according to reports. The couple was photographed celebrating with friends and family outside the Chelsea Register Office after a civil ceremony. Their intent to wed had already been posted in a public notice. Eberstein, a 39-year-old Swedish TV producer, and Grant have three young children together ranging in age from 5 to a few months old. It is the first marriage for Grant, who had a long-term romance with actress Elizabeth Hurley. The “About A Boy” and “Notting Hill” star also had a relationship with Tinglan Hong that produced a son and a daughter, ages 5 and 6. Grant’s official vows may surprise some, given his public stance on marriage. “I think there’s something unromantic about marriage. You’re closing yourself off,” he said on “The Howard Stern Show” in 2016. However, he also conceded that “there’s lovely aspects of it sometimes, if you marry exactly the right person, your best friend, and it’s cozy and it’s lovely.”"
POLITICS,"New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (D) announced his resignation on Monday, just hours after a shocking report in The New Yorker detailed four of his former romantic partners’ accusations of physical abuse. “It has been my great honor and privilege to serve as Attorney General for the people of the State of New York,” Schneiderman said in a statement late Monday. “In the last several hours, serious allegations, which I strongly contest, have been made against me. While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the office’s work at this critical time.” He said he would officially resign at the close of business on Tuesday. On Monday, Michelle Manning Barish and Tanya Selvaratnam went on the record to say that Schneiderman, 63, “repeatedly hit them, often after drinking, frequently in bed and never with their consent.” In one instance, Manning Barish said Schneiderman told her that “if you ever left me, I’d kill you.” Two other women, quoted anonymously, had similarly troubling allegations of abuse. After the most difficult month of my life-I spoke up. For my daughter and for all women. I could not remain silent and encourage other women to be brave for me. I could not... https://t.co/HvL5ech0RM Shortly after the report came out, Schneiderman tried to downplay the accusations. “In the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity,” he said in a statement. “I have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in nonconsensual sex, which is a line I would not cross.”  But just hours later, Schneiderman’s allies called on him to step aside, including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, both Democrats. “My personal opinion is that, given the damning pattern of facts and corroboration laid out in the article, I do not believe it is possible for Eric Schneiderman to continue to serve as attorney general,” Cuomo said shortly before Schneiderman’s resignation. Schneiderman has long championed women’s causes and has been a vocal supporter of the Me Too movement. One of his more notable actions as a state senator involved legislation to protect women from domestic abuse, including his sponsorship of the Anti-Strangulation Act in 2010.  Manning Barish and Selvaratnam each told The New Yorker that Schneiderman had choked and slapped them, and said they’d sought medical help during or shortly after their relationships. At one point, Manning Barish said, Schneiderman told her “I am the law.” She said that once after slapping and choking her, Schneiderman told her that “hitting an officer of the law is a felony.” As New York’s senior law enforcement official, Schneiderman took large steps to combat President Donald Trump’s agenda, including pushing to change state law so any Trump aides can be tried for criminal acts they’ve committed in New York even if they have been given a presidential pardon. His office also filed a suit against film producer Harvey Weinstein in February, alleging that Weinstein had sexually harassed women for years. Schneiderman had been running for re-election in 2018 for what would have been his third term. This story has been updated with further details from The New Yorker’s report."
POLITICS,"President Donald Trump on Monday urged voters in West Virginia to reject former coal executive and GOP Senate candidate Don Blankenship, throwing his support behind the two other major contenders in Tuesday’s primary. To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can’t win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey! All three leading candidates in the GOP primary have tried to attach themselves to Trump by emphasizing their commitment to his agenda. Last month, Trump invited two of them, Rep. Evan Jenkins (R-W.Va.) and Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (R), to appear with him at a White House event on taxes. Blankenship was not asked to attend. Claiming that Blankenship “can’t win the General Election,” Trump on Monday alluded to the U.S. Senate special election in Alabama last year, where he made a similar endorsement. He initially endorsed the establishment candidate, then-Sen. Luther Strange (R), over challenger Roy Moore, who had a history of controversy. When Moore defeated Strange in the primary, Trump quickly backed Moore and essentially disavowed his support of Strange, deleting his tweets about the latter. Moore later lost to Democrat Doug Jones, after facing sexual misconduct allegations from nearly 10 women, including accusations of child molestation. After the election result, Trump tried to distance himself from Moore by reverting back to his previous argument that Strange would have won the general election. Republican operatives are reportedly worried that Blankenship could win Tuesday’s primary in West Virginia. The former CEO of Massey Energy served a year in prison for his involvement in the deadly Upper Big Branch mine explosion. Blankenship continues to deny any responsibility for the accident, despite his conviction for conspiring to violate mine safety laws. He has also made bizarre attacks on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) a major part of his campaign platform, standing by his use of the racial slur “Chinaperson” to describe McConnell’s father-in-law, and arguing in a campaign ad that McConnell “has created millions of jobs for China people.” The winner of Tuesday’s contentious race will challenge incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) in November. Manchin’s seat is a top target of Republicans in this year’s midterm elections. In a statement Monday, Blankenship dismissed Trump’s tweet, calling the president “a very busy man and he doesn’t know me and he doesn’t know how flawed my two main opponents are in this primary.” “The establishment is misinforming him because they do not want me to be in the U.S. Senate and promote the president’s agenda,” Blankenship continued. “Tomorrow, West Virginia will send the swamp a message — no one, I mean no one, will tell us how to vote. As some have said, I am Trumpier than Trump and this morning proves it.” Meanwhile, Jenkins said he was “honored” by Trump’s tacit endorsement. “I’m honored that President Trump encouraged voters to cast their vote for me to Make America Great Again,” he said in a statement. “I’m the only candidate in this race who has backed Donald Trump since day one, and as senator, I’ll continue working side-by-side with him in the best interests of West Virginia and our conservative values.” This article has been updated to include statements from Don Blankenship and Rep. Evan Jenkins."
POLITICS,"The allegations that former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman physically and emotionally abused four women are violent and disturbing. But the fact that Schneiderman publicly advocated for women while allegedly abusing them in private adds another layer of horror to this story, which was reported this week in The New Yorker.  In his role as New York’s top law enforcement officer, from which he resigned on Monday, Schneiderman fought for women’s rights. The man who allegedly choked women in private introduced a domestic violence bill to make strangulation a violent felony. The man accused of slapping women so hard they had to seek medical attention recently filed a lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein and tweeted his support for the Me Too movement. And the same man who allegedly threatened to kill his girlfriends and called them “whores” promoted policies to better protect sexual assault survivors. The Me Too movement has shown that offenders don’t all fit the same mold. Louis C.K., Charlie Rose, Al Franken ― all have been accused of predatory behavior despite their overtly feminist and progressive politics. Schneiderman’s case seems particularly difficult to reconcile given that he’s being accused of the very kind of abuse he tried to prevent throughout this career. HuffPost spoke with Lori Haskell, a Toronto-based psychologist who specializes in sexual violence, about why equal rights crusaders can also be can predators.  How is it possible that someone who professionally advocates for equal rights could be abusive toward women in their personal lives? I think that offenders like this actually live with a cognitive split. They think of abusers as sexist men who would never do the type of work that they are doing. They don’t have an understanding that these acts of violence can be part of someone who considers himself to be quite equal and reciprocal in his relationships. And when they act aggressively or violently, they try to say, “This is part of a consensual sexual act. This isn’t part of how I treat women. This is something disconnected over here that’s private. This is not about who I am as a person.” And then they justify their violent behavior with some explanation that they were wrongfully accused or that these women provoked the abuse or wanted it. What is happening on a psychological level that allows this cognitive split to happen? Our prefrontal cortex helps us inhibit impulses so we can think through and organize our thoughts and responses. When the moral reasoning part of our brain gets deactivated by alcohol or high levels of adrenaline and stress, other impulses from our limbic system come to the forefront. We have a lot of these really negative emotional memories called implicit memories ― they are not part of the narrative we have of ourselves. They could include violent fantasies or deep-seated fears about loss of control. Schneiderman may not be aware that on an intimate level, he has a desire to be in charge of or dominate women, but when he’s in those moments and is fueled by alcohol, he has reactions and behaviors that he’s not able to inhibit with his prefrontal cortex. Schneiderman has denied the allegations of abuse, saying he has “engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity.” Could the fact that he’s championed women’s rights professionally delude him into thinking he’s not capable of being an offender? Men who think “I’m not sexist” and “I think violence against women is wrong” really do integrate these beliefs into their identities. When men like Trump are blatantly sexist and say demeaning things, it’s so easy for other men to think, “I’m not him like him so I’m not an abuser.” Some men are only aggressive like this in intimate relationships with women. They aren’t the guys that are going to make sexist jokes and they aren’t intentionally thinking, “How can I harm a woman?” But they have these private moments where they feel insecure or threatened or triggered. They might be inappropriately sexually aroused by problematic beliefs and images to do with controlling women, and commit an act of violence or aggression. So even predators themselves believe the myth that offenders fit an overtly misogynistic stereotype? They do. It’s not one type of man who commits these acts. It’s easy to demonize men who use their status to construct a world where they can have access and power and domination. It’s been easy for other men to say that’s unacceptable. But to varying degrees there’s a lot of men with similar attitudes and behaviors. It’s the same as racism. When white people see blatant racist behaviors, they can be outraged and say, “That’s not me.” But they don’t often look at the many ways they may hold some similar views and have racist attitudes. Do some people deliberately get in positions of power to more easily access their victims? I don’t know how much of that would be a conscious choice. I think more likely is people in incredibly powerful positions letting themselves exploit it. You have to be almost like a psychopath to actually think, “I’m going to become a doctor and have access to kids’ bodies so I can sexually violate them.” That is so disturbed. I think lots of men get in these positions of power, the opportunity is there, and they don’t stop themselves. As a psychologist, it must be a challenge to work with offenders who don’t acknowledge their own violent behavior. You can only change implicit experiences by recognizing certain patterns of behavior and working to change yourself. Schneiderman would have had to think, “There’s a number of times now where I found myself with women and behaved in appalling ways. I don’t know what triggered me and why. But I need to understand this and I need to deal with this differently.” I’ve worked with men who will hold onto the belief that what they did was consensual. When they get to a place of admitting they did it, they are upset. But they can’t stay with that realization. Men who have sexually assaulted women will often backpedal and say, “Her body was saying ‘yes’ even if she was saying ‘no.’” To think “I’ve harmed someone” is something many people feel extremely upset about.

ENTERTAINMENT,"Ariana Grande and boyfriend Mac Miller have reportedly split. The singer and rapper pulled the plug on their approximately two-year relationship because of busy work schedules, multiple outlets reported Wednesday. They appeared cozy backstage last month at Coachella, where Grande performed. But that’s apparently not the case anymore. The two had been an item since at least August 2016, when they were seen kissing at a sushi bar. They had collaborated on Grande’s 2013 hit “The Way” and Miller’s “My Favorite Part,” Billboard noted. Miller and Grande’s romance spanned a difficult time for the “No Tears Left To Cry” pop star. She performed at a May 2017 concert in Manchester, England, where 22 were killed in a terrorist bomb attack. The next month, Miller took the stage with Grande at a benefit for the victims and their families. TMZ, citing unnamed sources, reported that Grande and Miller remain close friends. Grande’s first studio album since the Manchester bombing, “Sweetener,” is due out in the summer."
ENTERTAINMENT,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hollywood actress Ashley Judd on Monday filed a defamation and sexual harassment lawsuit against film producer Harvey Weinstein, alleging that he damaged her movie career after she refused his sexual advances. The civil lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in Santa Monica, accuses Weinstein of causing Judd to lose a part in 1998 in the film “The Lord of the Rings” by making “baseless smears” against her. The lawsuit, reviewed by Reuters, alleges that Weinstein “was retaliating against Ms. Judd for rejecting his sexual demands approximately one year earlier, when he cornered her in a hotel room under the guise of discussing business.” “Weinstein used his power in the entertainment industry to damage Ms. Judd’s reputation and limit her ability to find work,” the lawsuit added. A representative for Weinstein issued a statement hours later saying the onetime film studio chieftain had “neither defamed Ms. Judd nor ever interfered with Ms. Judd’s career.” Instead, the statement said, Weinstein “championed” Judd’s work and “repeatedly approved her casting for two of his movies” - “Frida” in 2002 starring Salma Hayek, and “Crossing Over” with Harrison Ford in 2009. It also said he had “fought for Ms. Judd as his first choice for a lead role in “Good Will Hunting.” The statement did not address Judd’s allegations that she was sexually harassed by Weinstein. Judd was one of the first women in October 2017 to make an on-the-record allegation of sexual misconduct against Weinstein, which soon afterward evolved into the social media #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault. The Oscar-winning producer has since been accused of sexual impropriety by more than 70 women. He has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Judd, a leading member of the “Time’s Up” movement against sexual harassment in the workplace, is seeking unspecified damages and a jury trial. Judd’s representative did not immediately return a call for comment. The actress said in a statement to the New York Times that any financial recuperation from the lawsuit would be donated to Time’s Up “so that women and men in all professions may have legal redress for sexual harassment, economic retaliation and damage to their careers.” Click here to read the lawsuit (PDF)."
POLITICS,"Tens of thousands of National Rifle Association members descended on Dallas this week for the gun advocacy group’s 147th annual meeting ― once again with an assist from President Donald Trump.  Ahead of the event, which ran from Thursday to Sunday, the NRA said that 80,000 members would be attending and billed it as the largest in the organization’s history. But outside the convention center, another crowd assembled to protest the NRA’s efforts to stifle gun control laws. In the year since the last meeting, the U.S. had its deadliest mass shooting in recent history when a gunman killed 58 people and wounded hundreds in Las Vegas. And it saw a powerful uprising of young gun control advocates after a shooter gunned down 17 students and faculty members at a high school in Parkland, Florida.  The meeting was also a chance for commerce, with vendors taking orders for firearms, and it gave Trump a chance to address the crowd for the fourth year in a row. This year, people lined up hours early to get into the arena where he regurgitated many of his favorite pro-gun talking points. Take a look at photos from the annual event below: Clarification: Language in this story has been amended to clarify that vendors take orders for gun purchases at the NRA convention; those orders are finalized via customers’ local gun dealers."
BUSINESS,"HONOLULU ― A real estate developer in Hawaii is under scrutiny for its plans to build a residential high-rise that has two separate entrances: one for high-income residents and another for low-income earners. ProsPac Holdings Group is developing the 41-story residential building in the Ala Moana neighborhood of Honolulu. The high-rise will include 78 affordable rental units for people earning 80 percent or less of the area median income, as required by Honolulu’s affordable housing strategy. The other 351 units will be market-priced condominiums. If things go as ProsPac plans, the units will be separated with two entrances. This separate door has become known as the “poor door,” and it drew criticism in 2014 when developers in New York, London and West Hollywood proposed similar ideas. Daniel Simonich, an assistant project manager for ProsPac, told Honolulu Civil Beat the segregated entrances are necessary because the affordable housing renters and the condo owners will be managed by different companies and will have separate housing associations.  But the entrances and associations aren’t the only things segregating the groups. The condo owners will be able to enjoy the property’s pool, cabanas, dog park, fitness center and theater, according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. The renters will be barred from using those amenities. Simonich told Civil Beat this separation will make the costs bearable for renters. “The renters won’t have to face the burden of maintaining all those amenities because they will be separated,” Simonich told the nonprofit investigative news site. Social justice advocates don’t see it that way. “Ultimately this will be the first time we will have approved a mixed-use residential project with separate entrances,” Victor Geminiani, co-director of the Hawaii Appleseed Center for Law and Economic Justice, told Hawaii News Now. “That sends messages to all of us.” Tom Dinell, a professor of urban planning at the University of Hawaii, told Civil Beat the separate physical entrances could “stigmatize the people who qualify for affordable units.” “Affordable units and market units should be identical from the outside, including the entrance way.” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo did away with poor doors in 2015 after the New York Post, The New York Times and West Side Rag published stories on a luxury building that had proposed a separate entrance for its lower-income renters years earlier, inciting local outrage. “It’s such a visual separation,” state Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal told The New York Times in 2014. “It gets at people when they see two separate doors. It’s no longer theoretical. It looks and smells like discrimination.” New York blocked the entrances by taking tax breaks away from affordable housing developers who separate residents by income in their projects. Buildings under construction at the time ― like the Lincoln Square tower ― were grandfathered in. Tenants in Lincoln Square’s affordable housing felt the effects of the segregated entrances, as Rosenthal had predicted. “The thing I don’t like most is we don’t have the same amenities,” Christina Figueras, a single mother of two, told the New York Post in 2016. Eric Olm, a low-income renter in the same building, told the Post his windows overlook a courtyard that is restricted to only the wealthier condo owners. “It would be nice to actually get to enjoy it,” he told the newspaper. State officials have struggled to solve Hawaii’s affordable housing crisis brought on by the island state’s high cost of living and a shortage of housing options. In May, Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell unveiled a strategy to address the crisis, offering developers a $1 year lease and help with infrastructure if they build affordable housing options. William Chen, assistant director for ProsPac in Honolulu, said their upcoming Ala Moana building actually brings together low-income and high-income earners rather than separating them. “While most developers create a market rate tower in one location and an affordable tower in another location, our solution allows both projects to exist on the same block in the heart of Honolulu’s Ala Moana neighborhood,” Chen said in a statement to Hawaii News Now. “This approach is a response to international best practices in space management and forward thinking about the kind of urban density that will work best for transit-oriented community planning.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,"Big news, “Frozen” fans and their legal guardians. Last year, we learned the much worshipped and irrationally catchy Disney musical would grace the Broadway stage in the spring of 2018. Today, Disney Theatrical Productions announced the cast of the highly anticipated production. Meet your newest Disney princess.  Playing Elsa, the role immortalized by Idina Menzel, is vocal powerhouse Caissie Levy. Like Menzel, Levy has previously played Elphaba in “Wicked.” Her other roles include Fantine in “Les Mis,” Molly in “Ghost” and Sheila in “Hair.”   Judging by this 2015 video of Levy singing “Let It Go” ― as mashed up with The Beatles’ “Let It Be” ― families lucky enough to see Levy belt out the ballad in person are in for a serious treat.  Levy will be joined on tage by some truly magical talent. Playing the role of Anna, as played in the movie by Kristen Bell, is Patti Murin. Her previous parts include Glinda in “Wicked” and Lysistrata in “Lysistrata Jones.” Along with the leading ladies, the cast also features Jelani Alladin as Kristoff, John Riddle as Hans, Greg Hildreth as Olaf and Robert Creighton as the Duke of Weselton.  We still have quite a while until winter hits Broadway. In the meantime, “Frozen” will run an “out-of-town tryout” at the Buell Theatre in the Denver Center for the Performing Arts this fall, from Aug. 17 through Oct. 1, 2017. Single tickets for performances in Denver go on sale May 1, and tickets for Broadway performances will go on sale later this year."
ARTS & CULTURE,"The presidential portraits wing of the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery is lined with paintings of very powerful and equally pasty men. Its walls, filled with bowties, powder wigs and pursed lips, speak two well-known truths at once: Both the history of American politics and the history of Western art are blindingly white.  In 2018, however, the gallery will receive an addition unlike the rest. As was reported earlier this fall, a portrait of former President Barack Obama will join the Smithsonian ranks next year, painted by 40-year-old contemporary art star Kehinde Wiley. As a result, Obama will become the first black president featured in the gallery, and Wiley (along with Amy Sherald, commissioned to paint Michelle Obama), the first black artist to grace its halls. The former president and first lady hand-picked the artists who will render their official portraits. And those decisions hold weight. Antwaun Sargent, a 29-year-old critic who’s covered Wiley extensively, felt personally affected by Obama’s historic choice. “I grew up in Chicago,” he told HuffPost. “I knocked on doors in the dead of winter when Obama was running for Senate. To see him choose an openly queer, black man who has devoted his career to depicting black folks, it’s really full circle for me.”  Wiley’s paintings are easy to discern. Their backgrounds typically involve a florid design quietly creeping toward the fore, its composition a melting pot of British Arts and Crafts textiles and Dutch-made African wax prints. Up front is usually a figure ― young, attractive and black ― dressed in contemporary streetwear and mimicking the stances of Old Master heroes like Napoleon Bonaparte or Charles V.  Wiley’s painted subjects are often categorized as “normal,” in that they’re not particularly rich or famous, as portrait sitters for Titian or Jacques-Louis David tended to be. Wiley scouts his subjects himself, either on the streets of New York or through open casting calls. Like many artists, Wiley has an appreciation for beauty, but he gravitates toward a lesser documented masculine allure that manifests in hip style, performative swagger, defined muscles, tattoos and radiant black skin. “Sometimes I’d walk through the galleries just to look at the way the faces and the hands are painted, all the nuances of black,” Eugenie Tsai, the Brooklyn Museum curator who organized a 2015 exhibition of Wiley’s work, recalled. Once immortalized in Wiley’s massive, gold-framed canvases (they can measure as large as nine feet tall), his subjects shift from regular people to mythic giants. They ride horses like Napoleon, wield swords like Willem van Heythuysen and pose flamboyantly like Andries Stilte II, all while wearing standard blue jeans and sneakers. Wiley imbues his sitters with a gravitas and glory historically reserved for patrons, nobles and saints. His works build upon the centuries-old relationship between portraiture and power, using the canonized language of art history to exalt a new kind of subject.  “He literally is the first person I know of, throughout the history of painting, who is appropriating the entire history of art ― from cave painting on ― and bending it to his will,” Sean Kelly, founder of Sean Kelly Gallery, the gallery that represents Wiley’s work, said. “The whole history of art becomes a narrative about black presence.” Conversations about Wiley’s work often revolve around this one specific aspect: the idea of injecting brown bodies into an all-white canon. As the artist’s straightforward and affecting statement reads: “Painting is about the world that we live in. Black men live in the world. My choice is to include them. This is my way of saying yes to us.” However, Wiley’s paintings are not simply exercises in corrective representation ― making the invisible visible. They are intended to probe the mechanics of seeing and being seen.  “Many people see my early work simply as portraits of black and brown people,” Wiley told HuffPost in May. “Really, it’s an investigation of how we see those people and how they have been perceived over time. The performance of black American identity feels very different from actually living in a black body. There’s a dissonance between inside and outside.” Sargent described a similar dissonance between a white mainstream perception of Wiley’s subjects and his subjects’ understandings of themselves. “Kehinde saw something in these people that the larger culture didn’t see,” he said. “He believed they were heroic, that they had power. He painted people the way they imagined themselves, the way society has always ignored.” If conventional Western portraits calcify structural power, Wiley’s are vehicles for empowerment in and of themselves. They exist in the discordant space between assumption, reality and performance, where the self is as wrapped up in artifice as authenticity. There is, therefore, a parallel between how Wiley regards his subjects and how Obama, as a young man, imagined himself. To fête an unlikely subject is “not unlike a black man saying ‘I’m going to run for president’ when everyone is saying ‘no you can’t,’” Sargent said.  For Tsai, another overlooked element of Wiley’s work is its queerness. Female beauty has remained a near constant source of inspiration for Western artists, but appreciation of male beauty, especially black male beauty by a black male artist, can still bring a jolt to the system. “Instead of the male gaze ― men looking at women ― you have a sense that this is a man looking at men,” she said. “It’s no secret.” Portraying his subjects with exuberance and a hint of kitsch, Wiley embraces queerness as a lens, challenging the shallow assumptions that often beset young black men. “Wiley doesn’t only challenge the white gaze, but also the cultural gaze and the role of masculinity,” Sargent said. “It’s about black men trying to negotiate gayness in the context of mainstream gay society which has its prejudices. ’If I don’t look this way, or if I don’t act this way, am I gay? Am I black? Can you still see me?’” There is more to Wiley’s work than the goal of diversifying subjects and artists represented in the art world. Yet that initiative ― also undertaken by artists including Kerry James Marshall, the late Barkley Hendricks, Mickalene Thomas, as well as rising artists like Jordan Casteel, Henry Taylor, Njideka Akunyili-Crosby, Toyin Ojih Odutola and many more ― has tangible effects.  The Brooklyn Museum’s 2015 mid-career survey of Wiley’s work was wildly popular, drawing around 124,000 visitors over the course of three months. More than the numbers, curator Tsai was struck by the wide range of people entering the museum’s doors: art buffs and kids walking down Eastern Parkway, hip-hop aficionados and local families.  “For me, one of the most amazing things about the exhibition was eavesdropping on the conversations going on,” Tsai said. “It made me realize that everyone should have the experience of seeing someone who looks like you hanging on the walls of a cultural institution. You think of an exhibition as the work on the walls, but the interactions between the visitors and the works of art were crucial.”  Beyond expanding the scope of museum attendees, Wiley is also helping shape the next generation of collectors. “In the short term, he’s bringing a different audience to the work,” gallerist Kelly put it. “In the long term, he’s broadening the depth of collectors for the work. Kehinde’s work is capable of touching different audiences in different ways, so the collector base is much more diverse.” Kelly speculated that these real-world effects drive Wiley as an artist. “I think after 4,000 years of being excluded from the narrative, he wants to make sure that the next generation of kids walking into a museum don’t have to experience what he did. I think he wants everybody to feel like what they’re looking at represents them and in some way speaks to them.” Wiley grew up in South Central, Los Angeles, with five siblings ― including a twin brother ― and his mother, who worked as a linguist before opening a junk shop in the neighborhood. Wiley was influenced by his mother’s linguistic work, which explored the friction between American Standard English and the black vernacular and code-switching black kids adopt as a method of survival.  As an adult, cast in the role of “contemporary black artist,” Wiley is cognizant of the multiple worlds he inhabits and the distinct languages each requires. “It’s about being able to play inside and outside of the race narrative at once,” the San Francisco Art Institute and Yale University School of Art alumnus said. “It’s difficult to get right.” In a 2017 series, Wiley painted prominent black artists as “Tricksters,” fabled master code-switchers, to illustrate their dexterity in mythic terms. Rashid Johnson, an artist featured in the series and a friend of Wiley’s since 2001, described the experience of sitting for Wiley as very organized and comfortable. “I don’t think he changes personalities but he takes on a more directorial position,” he told HuffPost. “It’s Kehinde but a little more serious.” Outside the studio, Wiley’s peers describe him as brilliant, energetic and incredibly present. “He’s one of those people who walks into the room and the temperature changes,” Kelly said.  Wiley currently has two running studios ― one in Brooklyn, one in Beijing ― and is building a third in Senegal. The spaces operate like the traditional Renaissance studios of Leonardo or Michelangelo catapulted into a postmodern, 21st-century laboratory, with assistants ushering his large-scale ideas into being. The conceptual work is Wiley’s alone, but the task of painting is divvied up among a number of assistants who’ve mastered his stroke.  This studio setup, despite its significant art historical precedent, interrupts the persistent fantasy of the monogamous relationship between artist and artwork. As Wiley explained to GQ’s Wyatt Mason: “The sentiments about authenticity in the public eye, the discomfort with a large-scale art practice, comes from a myth in an artistic process that never existed.” Wiley romanticizes neither the creation of art nor its valuation. “Wiley acknowledges that he makes high-end products to sell,” Tsai said. “It’s partially tongue in cheek, but it’s part of his practice.” The understanding that art is not something precious and invaluable, but in fact, something very valuable, frees Wiley up to exhibit his work outside the typical art world-approved venues. In 2009, Wiley partnered with Puma on a collection of clothing, shoes and accessories incorporating the graphic patterns from his paintings’ backdrops. His work also appears on the set of Fox drama “Empire,” in the gilded apartment of Terrence Howard’s character Lucious Lyon.  “We wanted the character to be like a Jay-Z,” set decorator Caroline Perzan said. “So the question was: what would Jay-Z have at his penthouse in New York?” Wiley’s portraits ― flashy, epic, instantly recognizable and widely coveted ― were a perfect choice. Because the selected paintings, including “Officer of the Hussars,” were either hanging in museums or otherwise occupied, Perzan bought the rights to the images, then printed them onto high-quality canvases and framed them.  Some star painters might turn their noses up at the thought of their work appearing on the set of a soapy TV show, but Wiley consistently shows how arbitrary and confining the art world’s conventions can be. “I think Kehinde has been really smart about making sure his work has multiple audiences and [isn’t] just locked away in castles and museums where all people don’t have access to it,” Sargent said. “I think that is part of the genius of Kehinde Wiley.” Kelly agreed, recognizing Wiley’s willingness to stir up categories both in his work and with his work. “He is part of a younger generation of artists who are very comfortable moving between high and low culture and across cultural boundaries,” he said. “Take ‘Napoleon Leading the Army over the Alps,’ which has a contemporary kid called Napoleon on a horse in a pair of Puma shoes and a hoodie. Kehinde is prepared to cross all those boundaries and deal with all of those high art transgressions.” Obama’s official portrait, which won’t be revealed until early 2018, will likely not adhere to Wiley’s famed formula. Many of his critics and peers predict it will not feature a vibrant, textile backdrop nor a horse-riding Obama clad with sword or cane. But perhaps more important, Wiley need not adorn Obama with the traditional trappings of privilege and power to help white society grasp the authority he possesses. Obama has already transformed the way white America envisions mastery. In fact, when Obama ran for president in 2008, his image was already iconic, thanks to a ubiquitous stencil portrait by street artist Shepard Fairey. The portrait featured the candidate’s stylized face in patriotic colors, with the word “hope” written underneath.  Fairey’s portrait may have defined Obama’s candidacy, but Wiley’s will define his presidency. The pairing is as bold as it is fitting: a young art star in conversation with the entire history of Western art, embracing its norms while broadening its scope. With profound self-awareness, Obama aligns himself with Wiley’s mission of entering a historically white sphere and mastering it as the world takes notice. Nearly a year after a new president was elected, Obama reminds his followers of how he sees himself and how history will remember him.  Wiley has described his artistic practice as a “way of saying yes to us” ― the black community, the queer community, all the individuals who aren’t typically memorialized in golden frames. The sentiment echoes Obama’s lyrical motto, “yes we can,” which followed him from his senate campaign in 2004 to his final speech as president in 2017. With his official presidential portrait, Obama manages to convey this message even without words, exuding the radical optimism that he hopes will define his legacy: Yes we can. Yes we did. Yes to us. Yes.  CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Wiley’s age as 44."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Streamline recommends “Moonrise Kingdom” as the movie you should watch on Hulu this week. The service adds this on Sept. 16. “Moonrise Kingdom” stars two unknown child actors ― Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman ― along with a notable cast of adults that includes Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand and Bruce Willis. Wes Anderson directed this and co-wrote the screenplay with Roman Coppola. The two children run away and try to make a life for themselves together ― a very twee life. Then the adults start looking for them ― in a very twee way. Although the Anderson aesthetic is kind of out right now during this more hardened, ultra-cynical Donald Trump era, I still love this movie. I think you’ll find much to enjoy whether you’re revisiting it or watching for the first time. You can watch the trailer below. And if you want to stay up to date with what to watch on a weekly basis, subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.    “The Queen” stars Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II.

ENTERTAINMENT,"Seth Meyers unexpectedly hosted a different kind of event Sunday ― the birth of his second son, who was born in the lobby of his apartment building. What seemed like a routine weekend turned frantic when Meyers’ mother-in-law told him they had to get to the hospital immediately, the comedian said Monday on “Late Night.” Meyers said he called an Uber, but his wife, Alexi, declared at the steps of their building that she couldn’t get in the car because the baby was coming. So she lay down in the lobby and nature took its course.  Meyers said he called 911 for a very quick conversation: “Over the course of a minute conversation, I basically said, ‘We’re about to have a baby, we’re having a baby, we had a baby.’ I went from someone calling in about an emergency to sharing good news with a stranger.” The fire department and EMTs arrived to cut the umbilical cord, and neighbors helped out by bringing the family blankets and warm towels.  “So glad we are already co-op-approved,” Meyers jokes in the video above. Meyers got choked up while praising his wife for staying calm and showing him everything would be “fine forever.” But he also deftly mined the moment for a laugh. “I’m getting choked up just thinking about how brave I was,” he said. This photo says it all. Welcome to the world, little Axel!  "
ENTERTAINMENT,"The clatter of dishes, the murmur of diners, the sizzle of meat in the pan ― “Sweetbitter,” the new Starz adaptation of Stephanie Danler’s novel of the same name, is like a sensory bath immersing the viewer in a restaurant’s humming kitchen. It almost feels like you’re lurking by the kitchen doors in a real Manhattan eatery. That’s because, in many ways, you are. To capture the hectic atmosphere of a restaurant kitchen and the muted glamour of the dining room, the show’s creators decided not to cut any corners: They built a working restaurant as the set ― kitchen, dining room and all. “People were cooking food in that kitchen, and we were carrying it hot in our hands to ― sometimes, when it’s a one-shot ― to diners sitting in the room,” Tom Sturridge, who plays a bartender on the show, told HuffPost. “We couldn’t fake it.” The show premiered on Sunday, kicking off a six-episode season that feels tantalizingly brief, more like an amuse-bouche than an entrée. Like the book, it follows a young woman, Tess (Ella Purnell), who moves to New York City with little money and no particular plan and gets a job at an upscale restaurant in Manhattan. She develops a fascination with a hot, brooding bartender named Jake (Sturridge) and with an elegant sommelier, Simone (Caitlin FitzGerald), who teaches her about fine wine and food. The book is deeply informed by Danler’s time working at the Union Square Café in her 20s, and she brought that same granular knowledge of restaurant work to the making of the show. Every detail had to be right. “Steph was very particular” about everything from wine pairings to place settings, said Evan Jonigkeit, who plays a back waiter named Will. Before filming even began, the cast participated in a two-week-long boot camp, where they learned foundational skills like the three-plate carry (a challenging move Tess struggles with during one episode) and the one-handed ferrying of trays filled with glasses. Danler hired the woman who trained her at Union Square Café to instruct the show’s cast. Some of the cast had the advantage of already having worked in restaurants, like Jonigkeit. “He was a showoff,” laughed Purnell, who admitted to having trouble with the three-plate carry. “He liked to flourish those plates.” With its heady combination of sex, drugs and fine dining, the book was destined to be adapted to the screen. The realism of the show’s portrayal of the restaurant world goes well beyond the culinary details, to thorny issues like how sex, race and class manifest in the kitchen. The result is both seductively aspirational and shockingly gritty.  “I wanted people to be intoxicated but scared the way that you are when you’re experimenting with a substance for the first time,” Danler said of the adaptation. Some aspects may feel even more vivid in an era of increased consciousness around sexual harassment and sex in the workplace. During the first season, Tess, a trainee back waiter in her probationary period, hooks up with more than one of the waitstaff; she also learns that Howard, the manager, has been sleeping with one of his employees. The sketchy and eyebrow-raising moments bubble up but aren’t dwelled upon in the show: There are no after-school specials. “The show feels deeply feminist to me,” FitzGerald said, citing its authentic depiction of an imperfect, “complicated” professional world. Like the book, the show depicts “every single kind of sexual politics in the workplace, from consensual flirtation to drunken regrettable sex to microaggressions of misogyny to outright abuse of power,” Danler told HuffPost. “We just are writing about a restaurant that proves why [the Me Too] movement needed to happen to begin with.” The sensual delights of the show aren’t just sexual, of course ― they’re gustatory. Perhaps just as important as the nitty-gritty details, Danler brought her genuine passion for food and wine to the production, becoming a sort of guru gourmand to her cast. “[Danler] to me is like Simone to Tess,” Purnell told HuffPost. “I’m quite obsessed with Steph.” Simone, an elegant sommelier and server, acts as the wide-eyed new girl’s mentor. She offers her little lessons on appreciating fine food and drink, like how to roll a pricey Riesling around her tongue, tasting the sweet and sour notes. “Now your tongue is coded,” she tells Tess in one episode, after explaining where the taste buds for sweet, sour, salty, and bitter notes are located.  Danler “has taught all of us about wine,” said Eden Epstein, who plays a waitress named Ariel. “We go out to dinner with her, and it’s sumptuous and delicious.” FitzGerald also remembers going wine-tasting with Danler. Not that she’s acquired a mastery on par with that of her character, who during the first episode identifies a wine down to its vintage year after tasting just a sip. “I would say my palate is still thankfully unrefined to a degree,” she joked. (Having a taste for the finer things, after all, can be expensive.) For the actors who had worked in restaurants before, the comprehensive verisimilitude of the show created a woozy sense of familiarity. Epstein started on “Sweetbitter” shortly after leaving a job at Café Orlin in New York’s East Village ― and was bemused to find that, as part of her costume, she’d be wearing a fresh new pair of the same Dansko clogs she worn for years as a waitress.  FitzGerald, on the other hand, recalled leaving boot camp one day feeling inexplicably anxious. “I realized it was because I was having all these sense memories to when I was waiting tables,” she said. “So it felt entirely authentic to me.” For some, the authenticity brought up particularly hurtful memories. Jasmine Mathews, who plays Heather, the sole black server, told HuffPost that her role on “Sweetbitter” mirrored her own experience as the only black server in restaurants during three years of waiting tables. “The racism I experienced was profound,” she said. As a result, she said, she “didn’t have to dig” to relate to her character’s situation.  Daniyar, who plays a back waiter named Sasha, struggled to find work waiting tables when he first moved to the United States due to his lack of fluency in English. His character, also a Russian immigrant, faces a similarly uphill battle to become a server at the restaurant, despite being a skilled waiter. “It’s so painful to look back [at] those days when you felt uncomfortable, when people were mean to you,” he said, recalling the time he spent taking orders at a pizzeria.  “I’m a gay Russian man, completely different than Tess,” he said. But when he read Sweetbitter, he thought, “I experienced exactly the same.” And of course, Tess is the one viewers are encouraged to relate to ― the book is drawn from Danler’s own experience as a naive young (white) woman. In its honesty, “Sweetbitter” escapes the trap of lingering over and romanticizing the winsome heroine’s every misfortune. Whenever Tess herself falls into self-righteousness or self-pity, she’s sharply pulled up by the reality around her: Everyone she works with has their own sorrows and struggles and, yes, joys.  In one scene, she helps an undocumented kitchen worker, Santos, cash his paycheck ― unwittingly pissing off another employee, who had been serving as the bank go-between and skimming some off the top for a while. Her co-workers’ lives didn’t begin when she arrived. She’s just the newest entrant into a buzzing social and professional ecosystem.  So why not focus more directly on characters like Sasha, Heather and Santos? If given the chance, said Danler and showrunner Stuart Zicherman, they will. “We just were just scratching the surface of it,” said Zicherman of the show’s glancing explorations of immigration, race and identity. “We just wanted to tickle it because we really do want to tell these stories.”  In another season, he said, they might do an episode that follows Sasha home and explores his personal life, or an episode devoted to Santos, a character we’ve barely met thus far. “The whole first season is from Tess’ perspective,” said Purnell. “If there were to be another one, we would see it the other way. Follow hundreds of different storylines. The tree will grow, with branches.”  In Season 1, “Sweetbitter” has introduced us to a world of glittering exteriors, but only begun to hint at the complexity of a fine restaurant’s inner machinery. It will take digging deep into the perspectives of all those varied characters to break through."

ARTS & CULTURE,"Delta Air Lines has pulled its sponsorship from New York’s Public Theater after a staging of “Julius Caesar” included Caesar depicted as President Donald Trump, assassination and all. The modernized production is one of the shows at this year’s “Shakespeare in the Park,” and the characters look eerily familiar. The Public Theatre’s Artistic Director, Oskar Eustis, replaces the Roman’s toga and crown for a business suit and golden haircut in a more modern retelling of the classic Shakespeare tragedy. And Caesar’s wife, Calpurnia? Deadline described her as “swathed and swaddled in free-flowing silk, totters about in spike heels and speaks with a heavy Slavic accent.” Sounds a lot like Trump and the first lady, Melania, an immigrant from Slovenia. And of course the play would be incomplete without the most famous scene of all: Caesar’s death.  Et tu, Brute?  Following Kathy Griffin’s messy Trump joke, it may seem hard to believe that another depiction of a dead president exists, but it’s true. Inside Edition reports that the show is drawing mixed reactions, with some people feeling uncomfortable and others finding it art.  Amid the backlash, a spokesperson from Delta gave HuffPost a statement on severing its ties with the theater:  No matter what your political stance may be, the graphic staging of Julius Caesar at this summer’s Free Shakespeare in the Park does not reflect Delta Air Lines’ values. Their artistic and creative direction crossed the line on the standards of good taste. We have notified them of our decision to end our sponsorship as the official airline of The Public Theater effective immediately. Not long after Delta’s announcement, Bank Of America said it was withdrawing its funding for the updated “Julius Caesar.” The company issued a public statement on its Twitter page: We are withdrawing our funding pic.twitter.com/MlaONF82FN HuffPost has yet to receive a statement from The Public Theater. The show, put on at The Delacorte Theater in Central Park, doesn’t advertise any ties to the president, but Eustis posted a note to the show’s website on the meaning of “Julius Caesar” and its ties to democracy. “When history is happening, when the ground is slipping away from under us and all that is solid melts into the air, leadership is as transitory and flawed as the times,” Eustis wrote onto the site. “It’s the extraordinary quality of Shakespeare’s writing to seem fresh, and new, whenever we encounter it again.” Five years ago, The Acting Company put on a version of “Julius Caesar” that depicted then-President Barack Obama as the title character. The current “Julius Caesar” shows for free in Central Park until June 18.  This article has been updated with comments from Delta Air Lines and Bank of America. "
BUSINESS,"The latest news about employment opportunities offers a comeuppance to those who enjoyed a bit of “schadenfreude"" in the past decade about the plight of lawyers. We all partake in that sentiment, which in its original German means literally to take joy in harm — that ever-so-slightly guilty smile we cannot suppress when someone else is disappointed. For the general public, it was all too easy to laugh at lawyers as headlines proclaimed the demise of prestigious firms and the lack of jobs for new graduates. Members of the bar have never been much liked, even by their own clients who must pay bills for representation they would just as soon not need. Those who make a living through rhetoric typically have been suspected of being too clever for their own good.  Yet now there are warnings about the bursting of another bubble: for coders. Tech-oriented WIRED magazine, for example, recently published a piece predicting that those with the once esoteric knowledge of writing programs for computers likewise will witness a glut around them, followed by an inevitable adjustment to their wages. That would be in the downward direction. Computers are starting to program themselves now. Immigrants, women, and engineers everywhere from Eastern Europe to the Middle East, are entering the field. These cases of legal argument and computer programming are more similar than they are different. Although lawyers and coders appear to have skill sets that are not at all the same, they offer services subject to the same basic rules of the economy. Each community of experts might have been confident, too much so, that their training gave them immunity from the marketplace trends that anyone could observe affecting less skilled workers. If you are, or were, a riveter on the assembly line in 1980s Detroit, making cars, you might have foreseen what would befall you: automation and what would come to be called “outsourcing.” Your role could be fulfilled by either a robot or a rival in Mexico, China, or a non-unionized Southern state, or, for that matter, a robot in Mexico. White-collar professionals assumed they were different. The tasks they performed are about brains, not brawn; they are not asked to lift heavy objects at the office, and they do not sweat. The arrogance of lawyers is more than matched by many others who have earned impressive credentials. The problem is that even functions involving creativity and complexity can be commodified and thereby driven down to a price point, maybe not as easily but eventually. The temptation is to blame lack of leadership, technological advance, or global competition. Those are factors. The primary cause, however, is more conceptual. It is an innovation in framing. It is the ability of managers, and, more importantly, the consumers of almost all products, to package what is being purchased. If it can be standardized, whether it is a contract template or program subroutine, then metrics allow assessment of quality. An appropriate quantity then can be ordered. For those who are sophisticated, the specifications allow a choice between what is premium or “good enough.” The budget becomes the measure of success. Lawyers, coders, no less than architects before them and even physicians likely to follow, must submit to the mandate of the invoice, whether it is paid by an insurance carrier or the federal government. None of this should be surprising, much less cause for concern. It points to the importance of ongoing education. Adaptation and self-improvement are not the best means to respond; they are the only means. There are desperate efforts to constrain the flow of knowledge and the migration of human capital, tinkering with raising licensing exam scores and lowering availability of visas, but these moves cannot control the overwhelming forces at work. Supply and demand work inexorably. Lawyers and coders cannot escape their dynamic. The types of adaptation and self-improvement include blending domains of proficiency. The lawyer capable of writing code and the coder able to analyze law remain rare. When they too become common, an individual who aspires to greatness will be required to reinvent again. If she also is a “people person,” she has the ineffable talent of relating well to others. The day no doubt will come when a computer, or a representative who is halfway around the world and immersed in another culture, suffices for many purposes, but even then the natural person who is a native speaker of the same language probably will be preferred. For anyone who claims to lead, the challenge is to motivate people and support them. That means ensuring people have hope. They must feel their children will do better than they did. There is a catch. Their children will be compelled to do differently than they did."
BUSINESS,"A lawyer for Dr. David Dao, the United Airlines passenger who was violently removed from his seat Sunday on a flight from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky, said Thursday that his client suffered a broken nose, lost two front teeth and received a concussion during the traumatizing experience. A lawsuit from Dao, attorney Thomas Demetrio said, was “likely.”  “Here’s the law, real simple: If you’re going to eject a passenger, under no circumstances can it be done with unreasonable force or violence,” Demetrio said during a press conference. “That’s the law.” Demetrio is a high-powered Chicago lawyer whose firm focuses on medical negligence, airplane crashes and commercial litigation. His firm has amassed over $4 billion in verdicts and settlements, according to his website, and he has a reputation as a formidable attorney. Oooof I didn't realize that Dr. Dao had hired Tom Demetrio as his lawyer. I've dealt with Tom in the past. United is in for a rough ride. Dao “did in fact suffer a significant concussion as a result of disembarking that plane,” Demetrio said. “I can also tell you that he had a serious broken nose, injury to the sinuses, and he is gonna be undergoing, shortly, reconstructive surgery.” “Ultimately, long-term, hopefully there will not be any significant repercussions because of that,” he went on. “But he is shaken.” Agents initially said they had “no choice” but to remove Dao, 69, to make room for United employees on the flight. The company accused him of being “belligerent and disruptive,” but video shows Dao remaining calm in the moments leading up to the physical altercation. “I’m a physician and I have to work tomorrow at 8 o’clock,” Dao can be seen politely telling Chicago airport security officers in the footage.  However, authorities dragged a bloodied Dao off the plane as other passengers looked on in horror. @united @FoxNews @CNN not a good way to treat a Doctor trying to get to work because they overbooked pic.twitter.com/sj9oHk94Ik Dao’s removal led to a fierce public outcry against the airline, with even President Donald Trump calling the situation “horrible.” United CEO Oscar Munoz initially made things worse with a tone-deaf apology for “having to re-accommodate” customers. He followed that up with a more emphatic apology for “the truly horrific event,” promising that “we will do better.” “He was a paying passenger sitting in a seat in our aircraft, and no one should be treated that way, period,” Munoz said Wednesday of Dao. Demetrio called the company’s apology “staged.” United released a new statement on Thursday, again apologizing and promising not to involve law enforcement in future situations unless the need for “safety and security” calls for it. “This horrible situation has provided a harsh learning experience from which we will take immediate, concrete action,” the statement said. “We have committed to our customers and our employees that we are going to fix what’s broken so this never happens again.” Demetrio said Thursday that airlines ― United in particular ― have “bullied us” and “treated us less than we deserve.” “Are we gonna continue being treated like cattle, bullied?” Demetrio asked. “We all have enough angst for flying as it is.” Dao’s daughter Crystal also spoke at the press conference, thanking everyone for their support of her father. “What happened to my dad should have never happened to any human being, regardless of circumstance,” she said. “We were horrified and shocked and sickened to learn what had happened to him and to see what had happened to him. We hope that in the future nothing like this happens again.” This story has been updated with United’s latest statement and additional details from Demetrio’s press conference."
BUSINESS,"One of the overriding reasons why modern work is so boring is that we keep having to do more or less the same thing every day. We have to be specialists, whereas we would – deep in our hearts – surely be so much more fulfilled if we could be wide-ranging, endlessly curious generalists. You can understand the origins of restlessness when you look at childhood. As children, we were allowed to do so much. In a single Saturday morning, we might put on an extra jumper and imagine being an arctic explorer, then have brief stints as an architect making a Lego house, a rock star making up an anthem about cornflakes and an inventor working out how to speed up colouring in by gluing four felt-tip pens together; we’d put in a few minutes as a member of an emergency rescue team then we’d try out being a pilot brilliantly landing a cargo plane on the rug in the corridor; we’d perform a life-saving operation on a knitted rabbit and finally we’d find employment as a sous-chef helping make a ham and cheese sandwich for lunch. Each one of these ‘games’ might have been the beginning of a career. And yet we had to settle on only a single option, done repeatedly over 50 years. We are so much more than the world of work ever allows us to be. In his ‘Song of Myself’, published in 1855, the American poet Walt Whitman gave our multiplicity memorable expression: ‘I am large, I contain multitudes’. By which he meant that there are so many interesting, attractive and viable versions of oneself, so many good ways one could potentially live and work. But very few of these ever get properly played out and become real in the course of the single life we have. No wonder if we’re often conscious of our unfulfilled destinies – and at times recognise with a legitimate sense of agony that we really could well have succeeded very well at doing something else. It’s not our fault that we have not been able to give our ‘multitudes’ expression. The modern job market gives us no option but to specialise. We cannot be an airline pilot one afternoon a week, a tree surgeon two days a month, a singer-songwriter in the evenings, while holding down part-time jobs as a political advisor, a plumber, a dress designer, a tennis coach, a travel agent and being, additionally, the owner of a small restaurant serving Lebanese mezze – however much this might be the ideal arrangement to do justice to our widespread interests and potential. The reasons why we cannot do so much were first elaborated at the end of the 18th century by the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith. In The Wealth of Nations, Smith explained how what he termed the division of labour massively increases collective productivity. In a society where everyone does everything, only a small number of shoes, houses, nails, bushels of wheat, horse bridles and cart wheels are ever produced and no one is especially good at anything. But if people specialise in just one small area (making rivets, shaping spokes, manufacturing rope, bricklaying etc) they become very much faster and more efficient in their work and collectively the level of production is greatly increased. By focusing our efforts, we lose out on the enjoyment of multiplicity – yet our society becomes overall far wealthier and better supplied with the goods it needs. It is a tribute to the world Smith foresaw that we have ended up with job titles like: Senior Packaging & Branding Designer, Intake and Triage Clinician, Research Centre Manager, Risk and Internal Audit Controller and Transport Policy Consultant – in other words, tiny cogs in a giant efficient machine, hugely richer, but full of private longings to give our multitudinous selves expression. One of Adam Smith’s most intelligent and penetrating readers was the German economist Karl Marx. Marx agreed entirely with Smith’s analysis; specialisation had transformed the world and possessed a revolutionary power to enrich individuals and nations. But where he differed from Smith was in his assessment of how desirable this development might be. We would certainly make ourselves wealthier by specialising, but we would also – as he pointed out with passion – dull our lives and cauterise our talents. In describing his utopian Communist society, Marx placed enormous emphasis on the idea of everyone having many different jobs. There were to be no specialists here. In a pointed dig at Smith, he wrote: It’s a beautiful but entirely unrealistic dream. We have collectively chosen to make work pay more rather than be more interesting. It’s a sombre thought but a consoling one too. Our suffering is painful but it has a curious dignity to it, because it does not uniquely affect us as individuals. It applies as much to the CEO as to the intern, to the artist as much as to the accountant. Everyone could have found so many versions of happiness that will elude them. In suffering in this way, we are participating in the common human lot. We can be sure that – whatever we do – parts of our potential will have to go undeveloped and die without ever having had the chance to come to full maturity – for the sake of the benefits of focus and specialisation.

ENTERTAINMENT,"No one likes a loud moviegoer. But when that chatty audience member just happens to be Greta Gerwig and her on-going commentary is hilarious, it doesn’t seem as annoying. Or at least that’s what Twitter user Jaye Hunt thought when the “Ladybird” director and her friends allegedly waltzed into an almost empty screening of “I Feel Pretty” around 4 p.m. on Wednesday and sat down right in front of her. um I’m in a movie theater about to see I feel pretty alone and greta gerwig just walked in and sat down in front of me her friends keep coming in to join her and I’m terrified that saoirse is on her way Hunt, who was watching the Amy Schumer-lead romantic comedy in New York, said that she was “99.9% sure” it was the indie darling sitting in front of her and later tweeted that she was just going to post “omg greta gerwig is here and then move on with my life.” she’s drinking the biggest movie theater soda I’ve ever seen!!!! I always thought no one ever ordered the extra large but GRETA GERWIG DOES I’M CURRENTLY WATCHING GRETA GERWIG SEE THE BOOK CLUB TRAILER FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON But once she saw how animated and funny Gerwig was she decided to live tweet the whole thing. no one is sitting behind me so I might live tweet this experience This is what Hunt claims happened — and Gerwig’s on-going commentary is quite the ride. Buckle in and enjoy! full gasp from greta when emily ratajowski appeared. she’s a fan! there was just a bit where a baby saw amy schumer and started crying and greta LOVED it. she was the only person here who laughed “ugh” - greta at the end of the opening credits I’m... not 100% sure why but greta is CACKLING at amy schumer falling off the soulcycle bike? she’s still laughing and it happened a full minute ago JDDNALJDSLSOXNSLSOSJSLDODJALAOS SHE JUST LOUDLY POINTED OUT A PLOT HOLE AND SOMEONE SHUSHED HER every time a song plays in this movie she dances along in her seat which is VERY relatable there’s a weird vaguely homophobic recurring thing about amy schumer’s love interest being kind of effeminate and greta is NOT having it!!! the only true ally “I hate this” - full volume during a heterosexual love scene. honestly greta? same someone just fully left because of how loud she and her friends are being I’m CACKLING she’s checking her phone! greta if you see this don’t stop the commentary I love it amy schumer entered in disguise and greta loudly went “oh my GOD” and scoffed. this is the dvd commentary this movie deserves FULL VOLUME AT THE QUIETEST MOMENT OF THE CLIMAX OF THE MOVIE: “THIS MOVIE IS IN.

ARTS & CULTURE,"The Royal Academy's Rubens and His Legacy raises more questions than answers and make me wonder why the English find it so difficult to understand or even tolerate him. The clearest example of this confusion comes from the exhibition's fiercest critic, The Guardian's Jonathan Jones.  Jones is right at pointing out that the curators' decision to turn the whole exhibition into a Rubensian assortment of works by artists allegedly influenced by him, is a bad idea. The examples that he chose, however, to illustrate his point are so wrong that they evidence a worrying lack of awareness. From the beginning, Jones broadcasts his frustration with the curators' decision to place a painting by John Constable at the beginning of the show, nearby one of Rubens' landscapes.  In his own words: 'It is hard to think of a painter who has less in common with Rubens. But the curators have spotted one connection I never guessed: they both painted rainbows. That is the RA's less than precise approach to art history. So Rubens invented the rainbow, apparently.  Rubens and His Legacy tries to distort the rich and complex story of art to fit a simplistic big idea. Constable, Turner and Gainsborough - all of whose landscapes are juxtaposed with those of Rubens here - were fascinated by the great European masters: their biggest ""influence"" was the 17th-century French landscape artist Claude. So why try to claim that Rubens was somehow their one true source?' Even though it is true that Constable, Turner and Gainsborough's landscapes were influenced by Claude, they were more so by Rubens. While Claude's landscapes are idealised arcadian perfections with mythological figures, in Rubens' Het Steen we see a conflation of this and the Late-Renaissance Flemish tradition of Patimir, Brueghel and Bosch. It is that human inflicted ruggedness that Constable observes in Rubens and that is enough of a reason to suggest a curatorial link.   When referring to the curators' decision to include a Warhol portrait of Jackie Kennedy besides one by Rubens, Jones says: 'Please, tell me, that I am dreaming it! I really don't see any possible similarity between Rubens and Warhol'. Well, what about the fact that both were artistic superstars that used the pictorial surface as a space where theirs and their sitters' identities were negotiated.  It is a fact that when we look at one of Warhol's Marilyns, we see her facial features but we can also see him through his style'. Another similarity between these two artists has to do with the fact that they both  used to leave the execution of their paintings to their employees.   This confusion takes us to the real problem of a show that does not appear to do itself many favours by placing pieces by Rebecca Warren and Sarah Lucas along masterpieces by Rubens' and Andy Warhol. I think that the problem with this show is that it does not do what it promises to do. Even though the show's title includes the word 'legacy', there is no distinction made between 'allusion' and 'influence' for the former has to do with borrowing while the latter is often unconscious. Jonathan Jones, however, becomes insulting when saying that Rubens was not only just a courtier but also 'a supreme decorator who never touches profundity. Thus, he will never be a Rembrandt, Caravaggio or Velazquez. These three geniuses all lived in the same age that Rubens dominated. But where he created seductive confections, they tell a more serious truth'. Here, Jones misunderstands the use of 'chiaroscuro' with 'the ability to convey serious truth through painting'. Rubens' art should, however, be understood as an alchemic manipulation of something dead (pigments) into something alive (Inmortal Art).  His works has that centrifugal drive that demands an over-crowded pictorial space compositionally organised as a wheel which transforms the painting itself into an allegory of the cycle of life. Besides, while Velazquez used to be a painter of peace (for even his war paintings depict people at rest), Rubens is a painter of violence. There is always conflict and blood in his paintings to the point that it is not too far fetched to think that he uses blood as an allegory of painting for, at the end of the day, when one has nothing else to paint with, there is always blood."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Leonardo da Vinci has shattered expectations yet again with the sale of one of his paintings Wednesday. Da Vinci’s long-lost “Salvator Mundi” (“Savior of the World”) sold for a record-breaking $450.3 million at auction at Christie’s in New York City. The painting shows Jesus holding a small orb in his hand, symbolizing the world, and is one of the few surviving pieces of da Vinci’s work.  The Renaissance artwork was thought to be lost for centuries, disappearing from the collection of King Charles I of England in 1736. Charles Robinson purchased the painting in London in 1900, but the piece was no longer credited to da Vinci at that point, according to the auction house.  Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece Salvator Mundi achieves $450,312,500, a #worldauctionrecord for any work of art sold at auction. pic.twitter.com/snKxm7t3cb “Salvator Mundi” went through more unwitting owners before being discovered in Louisiana in 2005 by New York art collector Robert Simon. Christie’s auction house billed the painting as “The Last Da Vinci.” “Salvator Mundi” was authenticated after years of restoration and research that began in 2007.  The small artwork has gained international attention with BuzzFeed News even live-streaming the auction on Wednesday to thousands of viewers.  Da Vinci’s painting well surpassed the $100 million expected price, as the sale ended up being worth just over $450 million after including fees. The sale is a record, according to The Guardian. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"I had no idea what to expect from Teethmarks On My Tongue when I opened it, since it had been written by an American woman in Dublin, someone I’d met and liked, the chief book critic for The Irish Times. She’d given the thumbs up on all but one of my books, but I wasn’t sure what I’d think of hers. When her daughter, Nadia, was a child, the unmarried mother, Eileen Battersby, had no family in Ireland and she dragged the little child along. The management of the hotel had us sit in the stairwell of the Shelbourne. Battersby seemed wonderfully intense, extremely affectionate and intelligent, slightly mad. She lived in the country and could never leave her horses for long. Once she interviewed me in a little roadside hotel halfway between her farm and Dublin.  She was a very sensitive and curious critic, known for reviewing foreign titles in English translation, something most journalists were encouraged to avoid. She is open to every sort of literature of quality, even the most obscure. I sat over dinner last night with a French and a Malaysian novelist and they both had been reviewed brilliantly by Eileen Battersby, felt grateful to her but had never met her. My books are usually given to women to review; if a man takes one on, he’s either well-known to be gay or he starts his piece with “I, a heterosexual…” Just in case.  And isn’t the cliché that critics are disappointed novelists?  And first novels are supposed to be autobiographical, aren’t they? Happily, there was nothing disappointing or autobiographical about this book, save for an unusual affection for horses and dogs, but since I share those attachments, “Teethmarks” seemed utterly natural to me. It starts off with  high-octane intensity. Susan, a rather dizzy and eternally cheerful mother (one of Battersby’s best and most multi-dimensional characters) feels neglected by her veterinarian Southern husband and begins a dalliance with a younger man who, in a fit of jealousy, shoots her to death. The daughter (the narrator, Helen) was always too much the tomboy to get along with her self-dramatizing frilly mother (a Yankee with an exaggerated Scarlet O’Hara accent) but after the woman’s death the step-daughter volunteers to sing at the funeral. Helen, reflecting on Susan, her deceased mother, thinks, “Was she happy it was finally over and that at long last she wouldn’t have to try so hard to be happy?” (p41). There are moments in this Virginia sequence as brilliant as those in James Salter’s All That Is. Battersby is a subtle and convincing psychologist, not just for human beings but also for these one-ton gods in our midst: horses, and for those creatures that have evolved  in step with us: dogs. Her people are good, too. Here she traces the portrait of the cook in a French stately home: “She was a cheerful soul, motherly, careful not to step on the cats as she carried dishes out to the table; she referred to those squalling parasites as ‘mes enfants’ and never lost patience with the way, for all their stateliness, they’d grab at everything. The skin on her face made me think of wizened apples, lined and soft, flushed pink on sallow.” (p 259) Through a series of lucky accidents the narrator ends up in France  with a  stray dog, Hector, which she loves, and she is asked to work on a horse farm; in an oblique way Helen recreates a better version of her American adolescence with a kindly horse breeder, Monsieur Gallay, and another sketchy American beauty, nicknamed Lone Star, as vain and frivolous as Helen’s long-gone mother but a lot more hostile.  There’s also a handsome, eligible man… I admire Battersby’s comic sense, which never deserts her, her firm grasp of French social reflexes, customs and cuisine.  Her heroine has a drunken Parisian encounter with a totally sketchy man, but we’re intended to laugh at the American’s naiveté not the man’s beastliness.  This book is the sentimental education of an intelligent but unwary girl, who’s in love with astronomy and animals but doesn’t know much about the ordinary terrestrial life in between. She’s called Helen  Stockton Defoe , and like Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe she endures the strangest adventures while remaining fundamentally solitary. What do I know, but the horse world always struck me as oddly egalitarian; the ability to train and ride and care for the animals outweighs the social status of the equestrians.  (The heiress marries the stable boy, the lord of the manor dines with his trainer). Some of this egalitarianism rubs off on the observing Helen.  She sees the people around her with a true sense of their worth and, like a child, she is entirely indifferent to their worldly importance. For all her indifference to status, Helen is well-informed about the arts and especially her own fetishes, such as Caspar David Friedrich, the German Romantic painter of loneliness; Helen makes a special trip to Berlin to see his works. She is also taken with Van Gogh and with the Elizabethan poet Thomas Wyatt.  References to these artists are never  prestigious instances of cultural bric-a-brac but genuine dramatic turning points in the plot (the Wyatt poem, for instance, is cited during Susan’s funeral and it is not lost on the reader that Wyatt was accused of adultery with Anne Boleyn, just as Susan herself has died in a terrible adulterous mishmash). Culture—like the love of horses—is to be lived viscerally, seriously, morally."
POLITICS,"White House chief of staff John Kelly has often called President Donald Trump an “idiot” in front of aides and has portrayed himself as a “savior” who has singlehandedly rescued the country from disaster, according to an NBC News report published Monday that cited comments from eight current and former White House officials. Four of the officials said they’d personally witnessed Kelly using the disparaging term to describe Trump. “He doesn’t even understand what DACA is. He’s an idiot,” Kelly allegedly said during a meeting about the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and overall immigration policy. “We’ve got to save him from himself.” In a statement Monday, Kelly dismissed the NBC story as “total BS.”  “I spend more time with the President than anyone else and we have an incredibly candid and strong relationship,” he said in a statement. “He always knows where I stand and he and I both know this story is total BS. I am committed to the President, his agenda, and our country. This is another pathetic attempt to smear people close to President Trump and distract from the administration’s many successes.” White House Chief of Staff John Kelly calls our reporting ""total BS"" in a statement. --> pic.twitter.com/T0kpdsyliT NBC’s unnamed sources told the network that Kelly was known to “make fun” more generally at what the chief of staff saw as the president’s “lack of knowledge about policy and government.” They said Kelly has also painted himself as being the person responsible for shielding the country from Trump’s more erratic impulses.  “The strong implication being, ‘If I weren’t here we would’ve entered WWIII or the president would have been impeached,’” NBC reported that one senior White House official said of Kelly’s attitude. The chief of staff’s alleged criticisms of the president have been demoralizing to aides, the NBC sources said. They also accused Kelly of belittling women and of making troubling comments about the domestic violence accusations leveled against former staff secretary Rob Porter by that aide’s two ex-wives. Porter was forced to quit his job when the accusations were publicized. Officials told NBC that Kelly questioned aloud why Porter’s alleged victims “wouldn’t just move on.” John Kelly has told aides multiple times that women are more emotional than men, including at least once in front of Trump, four current and former officials tell NBC News. https://t.co/LltG93gcaM In Feb., John Kelly wondered aloud how much more Rob Porter would have to endure before his honor could be restored, sources tell NBC News.Kelly questioned why Porter's ex-wives wouldn't just move on based on the info he said he had about his marriages. https://t.co/LltG92YAMc Some of the officials quoted in the NBC story suggested that Kelly may resign this summer as tensions mount between him and Trump. But several White House spokespeople pushed back against the suggestion that the president and Kelly had anything less than a good working relationship and refuted the suggestion that Kelly had referred to Trump as an “idiot.” These officials told NBC that Kelly is in the Oval Office “more than anyone else.” They conceded, however, that Trump does get “frustrated” with the chief of staff at times. Stephanie Ruhle, one of the reporters behind the NBC article, defended the veracity of the story’s contents on Monday, telling Kelly in a tweet that it was people “on your team” who recounted stories of “you (not us) undermining [the president’s] credibility.” Dear John Kelly- As one of the people who worked on the story, I can tell you, it is WELL sourced.As for “smearing” the President, those on your team recount stories of you (not us) undermining his credibility. https://t.co/oTHDyj1Fif"
ARTS & CULTURE,"Over the years, acting has been hailed as a noble profession by some and equated with prostitution by others. Whether or not participants will get paid for their services is often in doubt. Yet there is no question that a wide variety of personalities benefit from participating in the art form. While acting allows people (however briefly) to become someone other than themselves, it also provides a unique kind of therapy for introverts battling emotional securities. Many a performer will confess that, in their private lives, they are fairly quiet people. Famous opera singers like Leonie Rysanek often admitted that, without a costume to wear and a character to portray, they felt lost on a stage. And yet, for certain neophytes, acting can be a powerful portal to greater self confidence and awareness of those around them. Two new documentaries show how acting affects different types of personalities. One focuses on an unusual group of Chinese students involved in a musical theatre project in Hong Kong. The other pays tribute to one of the greatest talents (and egos) in the history of film and theatre. * * * * * * * * * * Chuck Workman's new documentary entitled Magician: The Astonishing Life & Work of Orson Welles is cursed with having so much good material that it's hard to narrow the film's length down to 90 minutes. Because of his subject's prodigious, multidisciplinary achievements, this film could have gone on for days. As Workman explains: ""Orson Welles was truly a magician, able to juggle complicated ideas and techniques (as well as a complicated life) to create the essence of art. A few things seem incontrovertible: that he was ahead of his audience, and even further ahead of his employers (one executive told Welles that the audience expected hamburgers, so no matter how good a dish he could make, better to just give them a hamburger). With Magician, we tried to show the power of Welles's distinctive charm and provocative personality on screen and off, his life as a star, political figure, a fairly good magician, an aficionado of bullfighting, a lover of food, wine, the good life, and of many remarkable women, a man with a life of constant movement and exploration. Welles spent his life juggling art and commerce. Sometimes he behaved badly, selfishly and in many instances, against his own interests. Still, he was a fascinating personality with a remarkable life story and his films, in my opinion, are among the best there is in cinema. We were committed to getting all of Welles's finished films and as many of his unfinished films as possible into Magician. I had a wonderful couple of years working with and studying these films, which I had thought I knew. I realized that Welles, like Kubrick and Altman, created exceptional cinema that felt and looked like Hollywood films, but weren't. Welles had a vision of his own, and a fantastic set of filmmaking skills. He was a strong writer, a great director of actors, an inventive visual artist, and a brilliant, innovative editor. He wasn't without flaws, though, and I hope Magician shows that, too. He was not a great fundraiser, producer, or sufferer of fools. To tell this story, I was fortunate to have the participation of many members of the Welles community (scholars, associates, family, friends, even an enemy or two). At times they disagree with each other or with Welles. Whether Welles was one of the greatest filmmakers who ever lived (as many informed people feel) is something audiences can debate. That he was a singular filmmaking talent with a life that matched the singularity of his work was never in question.""  Marlene Dietrich assisting Orson Welles
during one of his magic shows  Born in Kenosha, Wisconsin on May 6, 1915 (the day before the RMS Lusitania was torpedoed), Welles was deemed a musical prodigy at the age of 10, directed a Shakespearean play at 14, became a painter at 16, and (long before he started performing acts of prestidigitation) showed an early talent for kleptomania. He was a star of stage and radio by 20 and, at 25, co-wrote, produced, directed, and starred in his first film, Citizen Kane (1941). At the age of 20, Welles directed a production of Macbeth for the Federal Theatre Project's Negro Theatre Unit, with music by Virgil Thomson. Set on a fictional Caribbean island (where Shakespeare's witches were replaced with witch doctors), it became known as the Voodoo Macbeth soon after its premiere in 1936. In 1937, he directed Marc Blitzstein's musical, The Cradle Will Rock, in a Federal Theatre Project production which became a legendary moment in theatrical history.  The Mercury Theatre's fascist-themed production of Julius Caesar Shortly after co-founding the Mercury Theatre with John Houseman, Welles directed, produced, and starred in a famous production of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar which opened on November 11, 1937 when he was only 22 years old. After that, Welles made history (and scared the bejesus out of millions of Americans) with 1938's legendary War of the Worlds radio broadcast about aliens landing on Earth.  Orson Welles performing in 1938's War of the Worlds radio broadcast  During his Hollywood years, Welles often performed magic shows with his good friend, Marlene Dietrich, appearing as his assistant (an unfinished television special was named Orson Welles' Magic Show). In later years, Welles became a familiar face on television talk shows and enjoyed making appearances in popular comedies. In 1975, he narrated a documentary entitled Bugs Bunny: Superstar. Timed to the centenary of the birth of his subject, Workman's fast-paced documentary includes commentary from such cinematic and theatrical luminaries as Jeanne Moreau, Sir Peter Brook, Costa-Gavras, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Richard Linklater, Julie Taymor, Paul Mazursky, and Peter Bogdanovich. Throughout the film there is never any doubt that whether using his sonorous voice to pitch beer and wine or perform Shakespeare, Welles was always a force to be reckoned with. Although Welles left numerous projects unfinished, Workman's documentary manages to include scenes from nearly every existing film made by Welles, including The Hearts of Age, which Welles filmed in one day at the tender age of 18. There are also clips from unfinished works like Don Quixote, The Other Side of the Dream, and The Deep. One thing is certain: If you enjoyed 2008's Me and Orson Welles (starring Christian McKay, Zac Efron, and Claire Danes), you'll love Magician: The Astonishing Life & Work of Orson Welles. It's the real thing. Here are the trailers for both films: * * * * * * * * * * For public schools in America that still have arts programs for their students, let me heartily recommend a new documentary by Ruby Yang entitled My Voice, My Life (which was screened at CAAMFest 2015). In her film, Yang follows a half dozen students witih special needs from Hong Kong's underprivileged middle and high schools (as well as some from a local school for the visually impaired).  Students rehearsing for The Awakening  Some of the students Yang follows have problems which would not only prevent them from participating in musical theatre under normal circumstances, but whose situations could easily make them doubt the value of even attempting to enter such a program. However, Nick Ho (a teacher, playwright, and producer) is someone who firmly believes in the power of musical theater to transform a person's life. Here are some of the students chosen to participate in his school production of The Awakening:  Jason Chow's reputation as a troublemaker had his school principal
worried whether he deserved to participate in the program.   Music director Emily Chung works with a young blind
student named Tsz Nok Lin to help build his confidence  In her director's note, Ruby Yang explains that: ""When L Plus H Creations Foundation decided to put on a musical, I proposed that they train a group of high school students who, through their own youthful perspectives, would film the whole process. Six student filmmakers were chosen to participate. Several months later, I went to observe the rehearsals for the musical. The first thing I spotted was music director Emily Chung coaching Tsz Nok (a student who had recently lost his vision) on his singing. With great effort he read the Braille using both hands. I could feel the strength and immense effort he put into singing and found it deeply affecting. After much deliberation, I finally decided to return to Hong Kong to direct the documentary.""  A make-up artist applies last-minute touches to Coby's face  ""The students chosen for the production were from disadvantaged secondary schools. I do not regard them differently from their higher-achieving peers, but question why this label of 'low-performance' has been forced upon them. During the course of filming My Voice, My Life I was with these young people on a daily basis. To a few students, I served as their counselor. By filming them, the camera became kind of a therapeutic tool. At the same time, I witnessed the personal growth that the musical training had given them. Strong bonds were being formed with the school principals and teachers.""  Nick Ho's students performing The Awakening  In 2010, a documentary about the Freddy Awards (written by Christopher Lockhart and directed by Matthew D. Kallis) focused on American high schools whose students were enthralled to be participating in musical theatre programs and competing against other schools in fully-staged productions of Broadway musicals. However, if one watched Most Valuable Players closely, it became obvious that most of the students in the film were from financially stable families (as opposed to some of the students in Yang's documentary, whose parents work long hours just to be able to feed their children). The students in these two documentaries differ widely in terms of financial comfort, burdens of shame and/or disability, and self-confidence. Without a doubt, watching the students in Hong Kong perform the Act I finale from Les Misérables brings a new and much deeper meaning to the moment. As filmmaker Ruby Yang notes: ""Although filming the documentary is over, this is just the beginning of a new chapter in the students' lives. Whether they will take charge of their lives remains to be seen, but it is undeniable that the seeds of personal growth have been planted in their minds, waiting to bear fruit. For example, 16-year-old Jacky (one of the student filmmakers) struggled with dyslexia, poor reading ability, and found it difficult to express himself. During the course of filming My Voice, My Life, Jacky finally discovered his passions, learned new skills, and enrolled in video-making classes. 18-year-old Sau Yan Wong is a recent immigrant to Hong Kong who discovered her love of the stage during the filming process and applied to a film school in Taiwan. These are perfect examples of the impact one's life can have on another: one's own decision affects oneself, and also influences those around him or her."" For those working in the arts, there is never any doubt about the potential of a theatre program to have a profound impact on young minds. Compare the trailers for these two documentaries (you'll probably have to watch the trailer for My Voice, My Life in full-screen mode in order to read the subtitles) and see if you notice what sets them apart.

BUSINESS,"Uber will no longer force individual victims of sexual harassment or assault into forced arbitration, the ride-hailing company’s chief legal officer Tony West announced in a blog post Tuesday morning.  Riders, drivers or employees who have been sexually assaulted or discriminated against are free to choose the venue they want to pursue their claims against the company, wrote West, who was a top-ranking official in the Justice Department during the Obama administration and has spoken previously about the pervasiveness of sexual harassment and gender discrimination. “It’s important to give sexual assault and harassment survivors control of how they pursue their claims,” West wrote in the post, noting the company’s need to regain the public’s trust. “Whatever they decide, they will be free to tell their story wherever and however they see fit.” The move comes less than three weeks after 14 women, who said they were sexually assaulted by their Uber drivers, penned an open letter to the company’s board urging it to allow them to pursue justice in an open courtroom, rather than in arbitration. “Silencing our stories deprives customers and potential investors from the knowledge that our horrific experiences are part of a widespread problem at Uber,” the women wrote. “This is not doing the ‘right thing,’” they said, alluding to the company’s new motto: “We do the right thing. Period.” The letter drew widespread media coverage, including over the issue of forced arbitration. The app’s terms of service require any rider with a complaint against the company, even of sexual assault, to commit to arbitration, essentially private courtrooms where a company typically has the edge in any litigation. West, who did a stint at PepsiCo before joining Uber, credits the new motto in his post on Tuesday, explaining that in order to actually do the right thing the company must now act with “transparency, integrity, and accountability.” Victims can now decide whether to pursue their case in open court or through mediation or arbitration, he wrote. And when survivors settle cases with Uber, the company will no longer require them to remain silent about what happened to them as part of the deal, he added.  Uber also said that it would publicly release a safety report that will include data on sexual assaults and other incidents that occur on the Uber platform. The moves are effective immediately, the company said, and apply to all cases currently pending against the company. Those who previously signed non-disclosure agreements will still be bound by those NDAs. “[Uber CEO] Dara [Khosrowshahi] recently said that sexual predators often look for a dark corner,” West wrote. “Our message to the world is that we need to turn the lights on.” One other tech company ― Microsoft ― has gotten rid of forced arbitration in harassment lawsuits. But Uber’s move is sure to affect far more people, as millions use the service each year. On Tuesday afternoon, Uber’s closest competitor, Lyft, followed its lead and made a similar announcement.  “Today, 48 hours prior to an impending lawsuit against their company, Uber made the good decision to adjust their policies,” a Lyft spokesperson said in an email to HuffPost. “We agree with the changes.” Lyft said it was ending its forced arbitration policy for sexual assault victims, whether they’re riders, drivers or employees. Like Uber, the company would still force class actions into arbitration. Lyft also said it would no longer require confidentiality in settlement agreements and plans to release data on sexual assaults. The company said it did not have an estimate of how much the change will cost and declined to say how many harassment and discrimination cases it has pending. Uber’s new policy only applies to individual cases. Victims and survivors who wish to band together and bring class action litigation against the company will still be barred from doing so. For its part, Uber contends that the vast majority of the suits filed against it are at the individual level. Other riders with complaints against the company ― outside the realm of harassment and discrimination ― will still be held to the fine print in the app’s terms of service agreement, requiring that disputes be settled via arbitration.  Uber also said it now supports federal legislation that would allow individuals to opt out of arbitration in cases of sexual assault and discrimination. A bipartisan bill like that was introduced earlier this year with the help of Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox News host who was able to sue the company’s chairman and CEO despite an arbitration clause in her contract.  “I’m proud to see companies joining our fight to end arbitration to give more women a voice in harassment and assault cases and unveil the secrecy,” Carlson told HuffPost. “I’m hopeful more companies will follow suit.” Earlier this year, Facebook told HuffPost it was considering whether to support that legislation ― and defended its use of arbitration. All 50 state attorneys general have expressed support for the bill, known as the End Arbitration Act for Sexual Harassment. In the meantime, the fate of many of those women’s assault cases is far from clear. Nine of the 14 women who wrote that open letter are currently suing the company and have asked a California court for class-action status for their case. The women will now be free to pursue their assault charges in court, but only on an individual level. They’re also suing Uber for misleading advertising and fraud ― and the company said those claims would still have to be arbitrated. “Our hope is that Uber ending forced arbitration for victims of sexual assault will begin a process to reduce future suffering by women passengers,” Jean Christensen, the lawyer representing the nine victims. “Uber has made a critical step in this direction, but preventing victims from proceeding together, on a class basis, shows that Uber is not fully committed to meaningful change.  Victims are more likely to come forward knowing they can proceed as a group. “This is the beginning of a longer process needed to meaningfully improve safety.” Moving to disclose data on rapes and sexual assaults is risky for the company, West acknowledged in an interview with The New York Times. He said he struggled with the decision because he knows it will be “disturbing,” according to the Times. Uber is a large company and it’s fairly easy to lodge a complaint against it. Also, there’s no standard on how to report such incidents, the company noted. Uber still hasn’t made one key demand: Tightening its driver background checks by running fingerprints through FBI and DOJ databases.  Uber has “so much money that they are willing to allow customers to sue them in court for what happens to them, but they are not willing to make the changes which would make the customers safe,” said Christensen. Uber disputes the usefulness of fingerprint checks and has pointed out that it has made a raft of changes to tighten up safety over the past year. Uber also said it will continue to force other disputes into arbitration, including when a passenger is injured due to driver negligence. Uber’s reputation took a serious hit in the last several years after a series of public gaffes, reports of sexual assaults by drivers that were mishandled and a sexual harassment scandal that felled Uber’s co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick.  In light of the numerous high-profile sexual harassment and assault cases across industries in recent months, West’s post also references the Me Too movement and Time’s Up, the coalition of women in Hollywood formed to fight sexual harassment. Uber announced that it created its new policy by consulting with women’s groups and advisers including Tina Tchen, Michelle Obama’s former chief-of-staff and one of the founders of the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund. This article has been updated to include additional comments from Lyft, Christensen and Carlson."
ARTS & CULTURE,"On Saturday, July 11, New York street artists FLOrE and Westgard share the spotlight in a two-person exhibition titled ""CALIFORNIA Dreaming."" The event takes place at Essentia Showroom in Santa Monica, an organic mattress store making a name for itself as a hip art venue.  ""I met John Westbay ""Westgard"" and Christopher ""Flore"" Florentino at our gallery's first opening night party over a year ago. At that time the gallery was featuring paintings by Gino Perez and my own assemblage artworks,"" said Lou D'Elia, curator of Essentia and an artist himself.  D'Elia has been actively participating in the art world for the past twenty years. In addition to showing his own work as an artist, he has guest curated museum exhibitions. He has organized exhibits at Palm Springs Museum of Art and most recently curated ""Lights! Camera! Glamour! The Photography of George Hurrell,"" at the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco.  D'Elia continued, ""They were in town visiting from the east coast and were cruising down Main Street in their rented convertible when they spotted the crowd inside the gallery at Essentia and decided to pull over and check it out.""

 The two artists made quite an impression on D'Elia...showing him photos of their work on their iphones. D'Elia set up a meeting for the next day. Knowing that they had a following in New York but were relatively unknown on the west coast, he decided to given them a joint exhibit. D'Elia added, ""They both shared a passion for art, had street art backgrounds and experience, and decided together to re-invent themselves as serious artists.""  FLOrE and Westgard said they were equally impressed with the venue and D'Elia and were excited to work with him. ""Lou is an awesome person,"" said Westgard. ""He has accomplished so much in his life. Still his basic desire to connect people and ideas through art is what drives him. It's what he is doing at Essentia, and it's special."" Both artists agree that their paintings work well together. They have collaborated in the past, but this exhibit will feature solo works...ten from each artist. ""There is a consistency and a contrast,"" said Westgard. ""Our work is of the same time, made up of the same fibers but from two different minds, and constructed so differently. Growing up in Marine Park, Brooklyn, FLOrE cites his Aunt Weezy as the person who opened his eyes to art. It was soon after she took him to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) that he decided he would become a painter. FLOrE explained that he is passionate about dismantling the constraints that he feels our society places on us.

 FLOrE used to do window dressing for Urban Outfitters. He said he loved the opportunity to use his artistic talents, but the corporate rules and rigid hours soon disillusioned him. He realized that he could combine his art with fashion and created the ""All Gold"" fashion line.  FLOrE paints daily and said he was looking forward to exhibiting his new work. ""I'm so proud of it...I can't wait to see how people react."" The artist has frequented LA. ""I love LA. I'm always out in LA painting.""  His work has been exhibited at Studio Bancs, Gallery 38, Stone Malone, NWO Gallery, and Lab Art. In New York he has shown his work at Gallery 69, Arlington Grocery, Manhattan Proper. FLOrE has been influenced by the likes of Pablo Picasso, Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat, KAWS, George Condo, Roy Lichtenstein, and Andy Warhol.  He added that Knowledge Bennett was another influence. ""His shows are very inspiring and well put together."" At just twenty-five, Westgard has been actively pursuing his art. He owned a successful barbershop in Brooklyn for five years. ""I started painting two and a half years ago, sold my business, quit my job and never looked back."" He has made a name for himself on the streets of New York with his LOVE themed art. ""I paint almost every day. I work with acrylic and spray paint...canvases and murals. I also design clothes for my brand.""  The artist was recently inspired by American Pharaoh's win of the Triple Crown. ""I have never watched horse races, but I watched this one and got the chills...I decided to paint a horse right then! When it was done, I just felt like his name was Ralph. I guess that's the fashion junky in me,"" laughed Westgard

 Westgard also has an affinity for paying homage to iconic works of art....such as Girl with the Pearl Earring by Johan Vermeer and The Song of Love by Giorgio de Chirico, which are in the upcoming exhibition. He has also paid tribute to Leonardo Da Vinci's The Last Supper and other popular works by Keith Haring and Vincent Van Gogh. He continued, ""Love is always what inspires me directly or indirectly...whether it's my love for a Vermeer painting or a moment I shared love with another person."" Although he has a long list of artists that have inspired him, currently his favorite artists are George Condo and KAWS. ""They are certainly my biggest inspirations. It shows in my work."" Westgard has shown his work in Los Angeles at Gallery 38 and NWO Gallery. In New York, he has exhibited at Manhattan Proper, Refinery Rooftop, Salon de Lafayette and more. ""I love LA. I'm here several times a year,"" added Westgard. ""I love the street art scene. Somewhere along the line, they seem to have taken the spotlight from NY."" Westgard commented that painting on canvas (using acrylic) is by far his favorite medium. He described his process. ""After finding inspiration in something (which could be anything), I begin with a pencil drawing...taking away and adding until I'm happy. Then I pick a palette and begin filling in color."" He continues to apply his positive pop art to fashion. ""CALIFORNIA Dreaming"" opens this Saturday, July 11, from 6-11pm with an artist reception at Essentia Showroom located at 2430 Main Street, SM; 310-450-7819; http://www.myessentia.com For more info on the artists, visit  http://loveforthepeople.co and Thatartistflore.com "
ARTS & CULTURE,"A 400-year-old play by an underground playwright named William Shakespeare is making headlines this week after The Public Theater’s recent production of “Julius Caesar” angered some viewers (and hence corporate sponsors) by portraying the Roman ruler with a curious likeness to President Donald Trump. Spoiler alert: The Trump-Caesar resemblance is causing tension because, as any Shakespeare or “Mean Girls” devotee knows, Caesar is assassinated in the course of the play. Or, as Fox & Friends reported, “President Trump [is] brutally stabbed to death by women and minorities.”  Of course, Shakespeare did not pen his bloody death sequence with Trump in mind. Nevertheless, artistic director Oskar Eustis’ decision to stage the killing of a mercurial, blonde-haired ruler in an ill-fitting suit and too-long red tie has drawn criticism from some viewers, various right-wing media outlets and Donald Trump Jr. I wonder how much of this ""art"" is funded by taxpayers? Serious question, when does ""art"" become political speech & does that change things? https://t.co/JfOmLLBJCn Delta Airlines and Bank of America responded to the firestorm by withdrawing financial support from the production, which is currently running at Central Park’s Delacorte Theater as part of New York’s famed Shakespeare in the Park festival. Delta released a statement condemning the performance’s “graphic staging,” describing the show’s artistic and creative direction as having “crossed the line on the standards of good taste.” A spokeswoman for Bank of America similarly lamented that “The Public Theater chose to present ‘Julius Caesar’ in a way that was intended to provoke and offend.” American Express also tweeted that the company does not “condone the interpretation of the Julius Caesar play” despite its continued sponsorship of The Public Theater’s other endeavors. As corporations severed ties to the show, theater buffs and high school English honors students were quick to call out the absurdity of the denunciations ― not only because of a little thing called freedom of speech, but because many don’t quite seem to recall what the whole message of “Julius Caesar” actually is.  THE ENTIRE GODDAMN PLAY IS ABOUT ASSASSINATION BEING A TOTAL DISASTER! THE PATH TO RUIN!!! Read a book for the love of God. Yes, Eustis’ production of “Julius Caesar” features, in no subtle terms, a Trumpian ruler being stabbed to death by senators, ostensibly, for the good of their nation. But the remainder of the play hashes out how this decision to off a tyrannical ruler in such an undemocratic manner yields nothing but disaster.  As New York Times’ Jesse Green wrote in his review of the show: “Even a cursory reading of the play, the kind that many American teenagers give it in high school, is enough to show that it does not advocate assassination. Shakespeare portrays the killing of Caesar by seven of his fellow senators as an unmitigated disaster for Rome, no matter how patriotic the intentions.” For those whose memories have faded a bit since 11th grade, a brief refresher: “Julius Caesar” tells the tale of a demagogue ruling the Roman republic in 44 B.C. A conspiracy grows against the ruler, a man senators feel has grown tyrannical and threatens the future of the nation. In the famed Act 3, Scene 1, Caesar is killed by his fellow statesmen under the guise of patriotism.  Yet the decision to kill Caesar ends up shattering Rome’s democracy, rather than saving it. The play, then, warns viewers against violent reactions to despotic rule. As Eustis wrote in a note regarding the show: “’Julius Caesar’ can be read as a warning parable to those who try to fight for democracy by undemocratic means. To fight the tyrant does not mean imitating him.” To suggest the production advocates for or excuses violence in any way is just false. If anything, the play suggests the very opposite, advising against the power-hungriness both Caesar and his opponents embody. If the advice is not heeded, as Gregg Henry, the actor playing Caesar at The Public, warned cheekily in an interview with Backstage: “You can end up losing democracy for like, 2,000 years.” For some viewers, however, the message of Shakespeare’s words has faded into the background, overshadowed by the visceral power of a Trump-like actor’s white shirt stained with fake blood making its rounds across social media. One named Laura Shaeffer expressed her disgust in an interview with Mediaite. “To be honest I thought it was shocking and distasteful,” she said. “If this had happened to any other president — even as recently as Barack Obama or George W. Bush — it would not have flown. People would have been horrified.” Fair enough, except past productions have featured Caesar in the guise of both presidents listed above, among others. Presidents portrayed as Julius Caesar in U.S. productions: Lincoln, Reagan, Clinton, GWB, Obama, Trump. (Caesar died in all of them.) In a 2013 review of “Julius Caesar” at Minneapolis St. Paul’s Guthrie Theater, a critic for Mpls St Paul Magazine described the value of casting Caesar as a “tall, lanky black man,” despite the resemblance being “too obvious.” “Like Caesar, Obama rose to power on a tide of public goodwill,” the piece reads, “like Caesar, there were many in government who doubted Obama’s leadership abilities; and now that Obama’s first term has failed to live up to the messianic hype, there are plenty of people who — for the good of the country, you understand, not their own glory — want to take Obama down.” So, this whole cast-a-Shakespearian-tale-in-modern-day-light thing is nothing new. It’s actually, a centuries-old practice. And Trump isn’t being forced to endure anything to which previous American presidents haven’t already been subjected. For eons, political leaders have been accused of greed, egotism and a lust for power. Democracy, as a result, can feel fragile ― if not under siege. Art exists in times like these to illuminate the patterns between past and present while untangling the particulars that distinguish each. It can stir provocation, yes, but also reflection, dissent and enlightenment.  The theater is often viewed as a space for pushing boundaries and critical thinking. In this production, despite the bloodshed onstage, no real person leaves wounded or endangered; audiences are not encouraged to wreck havoc on any American politician. (In fact, quite the opposite.) To suggest the staging of one of the most esteemed dramas of all time is “political speech” targeted directly and uniquely at Trump not only ignores the play’s message, but its history, too.   As one seemingly incredulous viewer said in a video interview with Inside Edition: “It’s not really the president, it’s theater. Everyone knows it’s theater.”  Have plans to see ""Julius Caesar"" (Shakespeare-in-the-Park)  in thrilled defiance of ignorant would-be censors  (Faux News, Delta airlines). Julius Caesar is slated to run at Central Park’s Delacorte Theater until June 18 as part of New York’s Shakespeare in the Park festival. Tickets are free. Welcome to Battleground, where art and activism meet."
BUSINESS,"LOS ANGELES — Tony Rosado sits in the silent back room of El Mercado with a giant stack of papers piled in front of him on a sturdy wooden table. The papers are part of his appeals to stop the construction of Lorena Plaza, a 49-unit supportive housing complex that has been proposed for an empty parcel of land next to his market in this historically Latino neighborhood east of downtown. “Why in Boyle Heights?” he asked. “I dare you to go try and build this in Beverly Hills. It would never get through.”  El Mercado, which Rosado took over after his father died in 2014, is a three-story restaurant and market packed with stalls of vendors, or puestos, selling cowboy boots, Communion dresses, religious paraphernalia, tubs of obscure moles and dried sweets. Boyle Heights is one of the most heavily Latino communities in the city, and El Mercado is its vibrant nerve center.  Lorena Plaza is one of the complexes that nonprofit developers have proposed to house the 58,000 people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles. Voters approved a 2017 ballot measure calling for a $1.2 billion bond to fund permanent supportive housing for the chronically homeless. But where exactly that housing should go has proven a much more difficult question.  Boyle Heights is known citywide for its residents’ vigorous anti-gentrification efforts. They’ve fought to keep richer, whiter transplants from encroaching on their territory. In a sense, Rosado’s fight to keep housing for the homeless out of his neighborhood is part of the same struggle for agency. Rosado says Lorena Street isn’t the right place for housing for the homeless. El Mercado gets busy on the weekends, and cars zoom down Lorena Street and into the parking lot. A Metro train line also runs nearby.  “To put a sensitive population so close to a busy cultural center and next to exposed railroad tracks?” Rosado said. “I don’t think that’s the right thing to do.” The Rosado family has been fighting Lorena Plaza for years. They filed an environmental appeal with the city’s Planning and Land Use Management Committee in May 2017, citing uncapped oil wells on the property that could present a danger to residents if they leaked. The family found a sympathetic ear with Councilmember Jose Huizar, who approved their appeal in the committee and stalled construction until a full environmental review was conducted. Housing developers and other critics claim such resistance pits communities against the will of citywide voters. In an open letter to Huizar during the appeal meetings, L.A.’s top nonprofit developers argued that the appeal “would deny Los Angeles voters the mandate and action they overwhelmingly supported.” “We all care and we all want to eradicate homelessness,” said Janet Kim, a Los Feliz resident and member of a multi-neighborhood homelessness task force, SELAH Neighborhood Homeless Coalition, that includes residents from Silver Lake, Echo Park, Los Feliz, Atwater Village and Hollywood. The problem, she said, is “that people are on the fence about how we’re going to do that.” This concern isn’t limited to Boyle Heights. Residents of Venice ― a wealthy, white oceanside neighborhood where companies like Snap Inc., Google, YouTube and Vice have mutated the community into a post-gentrification business district of sorts ― have also fought plans to build housing for the homeless.  Suburbanites in leafy, pleasant Temple City have successfully stalled the redevelopment of a motel that was planned for supportive housing. Property owners in Lincoln Heights are also rallying against a handful of housing proposals. “Five is too many,” reads the mission statement of the Coalition to Protect Lincoln Heights. Still, Rosado thinks his situation in Boyle Heights is different from other conflicts around the city. Residents here feel their voices have been ignored, and say community outreach was inadequate for this kind of development. A Community of Friends, the nonprofit developer seeking to build Lorena Plaza, seems surprised by the backlash. In the past 30 years, ACOF has built 42 supportive housing complexes in the city without much controversy. “The word I would use to describe us was ‘stealth,’” said Dora Leong Gallo, ACOF’s director. “We built the buildings, we operated and moved people in, and nobody was the wiser. People ask if this is a brand-new thing, like we’ve never done it before. That’s not quite true.” Gallo knows better than most the complexities of building units in a city historically constrained by rigid planning laws, and ACOF usually navigates the process well. But the Lorena Plaza development has been particularly difficult. Gallo believes the Rosados’ environmental appeal was disingenuous. The opposition to Lorena Plaza stems from stereotypes of the homeless, she argued, pointing to the Rosados’ initial appeals. The late Pedro Rosado told a Metro Board hearing in 2013 that he was “very appalled how people are not mentioning that in this facility they are trying to bring mentally ill people to put our children at risk.”  Boyle Heights was already primed for a fight over development. Non-local artists have been opening new galleries here, like 356 Mission and BBQ LA, which attracted the ire of activist-residents. Last year, Weird Wave Brewers, a coffee shop owned by two white men and a Latino man (none of whom live in Boyle Heights), opened on Cesar Chavez Avenue, prompting concerns that the neighboring Arts District ― which is demographically wealthier, whiter and younger ― was trickling into the barrio. Rosado argues that the city is taking advantage of the mostly Spanish-speaking, low-income residents of Boyle Heights, and that other neighborhoods would never have to fight so hard to keep out a proposal like this. “They would lobby their representatives and then bombard their offices with calls,” he said. “They would pull all their financial support for their campaigns if their representatives were allowing these types of projects to get through.” He suggested that people experiencing homelessness be housed on the outskirts of the city, “where it’s not the white-collar people that are affected or the blue-collar.” On March 6, the L.A. City Council held a final vote on the Lorena Plaza environmental appeal. Dozens of supporters of the project, identified by fluorescent yellow stickers that said “Lorena Plaza, SUPPORTER,” packed the aisles of City Hall’s chambers. There did not appear to be any critics of the development present. The Rosado family was not in attendance, but their lawyer read aloud a statement arguing that the city is responsible for investigating the environmental concerns thoroughly, and urging the council to pursue a new assessment. ACOF’s Gallo also addressed the council, telling them her organization has “remained optimistic and steadfast in our belief that this is a good project at a good location, and reasonable people who care about the state of homelessness in Los Angeles can successfully negotiate a solution.” Huizar, the councilmember, raised concerns about community involvement in the proposal.  “It’s not an issue of NIMBYism or against permanent supportive housing. It’s an issue about community process, building trust, no matter what you’re building ― whether it’s a retail center, permanent supportive housing, commercial,” he said. “Whatever it is, there needs to be trust between the applicant, the developer and the local community, and that’s what was lacking here.” Yet Huizar recommended that his colleagues deny the appeal and allow ACOF to build Lorena Plaza. Then the council cast its vote: thirteen in favor of allowing the development to go forward, and zero opposed.  Gallo said she was pleased with the result, especially Huizar’s about-face. “It’s a pretty incredible feeling to have him change his mind, because it’s hard, and he does want what is best for his community, and I recognize that,” she said. Gallo expects to break ground in fall 2019, with a completion date toward the end of 2020. Tony Rosado said he is “disappointed,” but isn’t backing down yet. “We’re going to continue fighting it,” he said. “We’re going to pursue our legal options.”  In a statement to HuffPost, Huizar said the developer has agreed to complete the necessary environmental review, and will ensure the soil is clean. He also emphasized the importance of community involvement as the city seeks housing solutions for people experiencing homelessness.  “As we unroll our efforts to construct permanent supportive housing throughout the City, we need to be completely honest with the public from the outset and throughout the approval processes,” he said. “That doesn’t mean everyone will be happy with every project, but unlike this process, at least we’ll all be clear about what is being proposed.” On April 5, Rosado filed suit against the city of Los Angeles, alleging that environmental law had been broken. The writ, submitted by Rosado’s lawyers, asks for the city’s decision to be vacated in lieu of a full environmental review. It also asks for the suspension of the “authority of City and City Council... to grant any authority, permits or entitlements as part of the Project” until a full review is conducted. This story is part of the series Homeless on the Streets of L.A., a four-month investigation by students at USC Annenberg’s Reporting on the Homeless class. The project, overseen by veteran journalists Mary Murphy and Sandy Tolan, continues through early 2019. Contact atolan@usc.edu or mmurphystar@yahoo.com for more info."
ARTS & CULTURE," Photo credit: Jeffrey Hornstein ""Watch out,"" Janine Molinari laughs, flashing me a megawatt smile. ""They're gonna come at you!"" No sooner has the acclaimed choreographer-director-dance teacher spoken than her students, 20 of Broadway's finest child performers, come barreling toward me, spiraling backward and forward as their miniature feet tap out a glorious rhythm. Though I'm out of breath just watching these kids thunder through routine after routine, their obvious joy in the work is undeniably exhilarating.  Janine, a pixie-like dynamo in red tap shoes, has cultivated a private but immensely supportive atmosphere at Dance Molinari (DMO). With studios in New York and Los Angeles, DMO has become the go-to company for serious triple-threat juveniles who want to prep for auditions and shows in a collaborative, open hearted environment. Celebrities such as Ariana Grande and Nick Jonas began their careers as DMO students, and every young artist cycling through Janine's ""Super Saturday"" workshop is a literal Broadway baby.  ""It's a cross-section of kids,"" Molinari informs me. ""I do a ton of one-on-one coachings when the kids are in shows, so some of them don't come to the Saturday class for months because they come to me during the week.""  Of this morning's group, she says, ""The little ones have all been in Matilda or Annie; the teenagers in Billy Elliot or Mary Poppins."" (I recognize quite a few among the youthful assembly, including Rachel Resheff from Larry David's Fish in the Dark and veteran Broadway kid Matthew Gumley, best known outside theatre circles for his prolific voiceover work.) But no matter who shows up, Janine's infectious energy sets the tone. It's clear from her enthusiastic and motivational teaching style that Ms. Molinari is quite the opposite of Dance Moms' Abby Lee Miller; the doyenne of DMO likes to encourage her students with equal parts science, craft and good old TLC. ""Raise your hand if you need a friend!"" she calls out during a partner exercise. ""We're all friends here. This is not a competition."" She also frequently reminds them to smile, ""because smiling relaxes your body. Remember, you're not just dancers; you're also actors and singers, and your body needs to be relaxed so you can talk and sing while you're doing this."" Even knowing that these tweens and teens are pros, I'm still amazed to hear a 9-year-old calmly inquire, ""Can you break it down?"" when Janine introduces a new dance combination. However, his precocious comportment is the only thing calm about Super Saturday. The students remain in perpetual motion, jumping from basic warm-ups to synchronized routines to the finale from Footloose (which Molinari is directing and choreographing this season at Connecticut's Seven Angels Theatre). Though opportunities for tension abound, the mood is continually jovial. What's supposed to be work feels a whole lot more like a dance party. After class Janine and I chat over coffee, our conversation punctuated with raucous peals of laughter. (When you put two bubbly creative types together, hilarity inevitably ensues.) ""I never expected any of this,"" she confesses. ""Dance Molinari is in its 15th year, but it wasn't meant to be a business. It was meant to be fun."" From an early age Janine knew performing was her passion, but choreography became an obsession: ""I'd be getting ready for recitals and I'd redo my numbers. My mind always went back to seeing things in pictures or how we could change the movement or shape of something."" Her educational experience reflects this; Molinari, a Staten Island native, first enrolled at Flagler College in St. Augustine, Florida, where by her sophomore year she was choreographing the school's mainstage shows and teaching dance classes. Ever ambitious, she moved back to New York where she graduated from Wagner College and began booking Broadway and Off-Broadway national tours. In 2000, while playing in Tony 'n' Tina's Wedding, Janine's fellow cast members asked her to teach them to tap, which led to a fateful meeting one Thanksgiving weekend. I started doing a warm-up with my adults -- all I taught then were adults -- got a knock on the door, and found all these kids out in the hallway with their parents. They said, 'Our dance teacher didn't show up today. Can we take your class?' I said, 'I'm so sorry. I don't teach kids.' And they said, 'Well, can we take it just for today?' So I said, 'Sure, come on in.' Turns out they were in Annie Get Your Gun and all these big shows. They out-tapped the adults! After the class they asked if they could come back and they told more and more kids, and that's how the business grew. We've really been infiltrated with Broadway kids who are now pop stars and on TV shows. While Molinari's seen many students come and go, she admits retaining a soft spot for Ariana Grande:  Ariana is very special, with a smile that lights up any room. She's an extremely hard worker who takes her craft seriously, but at the same time is always looking to create something new. I have a very vivid memory of her bringing in the song 'Jai Ho' and being super excited for us to choreograph it! Sometimes bragging on her students draws Janine into her own adventures. Last year while in L.A., Molinari visited actor Dylan Snyder, a longtime DMO alum, on the set of the Disney series Kickin' It. During filming, Janine mentioned Snyder's tapping ability to the show's producers, who immediately decided to incorporate it into a new episode for Kickin' It's final season and invited her to choreograph a routine. (The episode, ""Bringing Down the House,"" aired in early March.) Choreographing for TV is really nice. I loved it because I had my script ahead of time and it's all done in a week. But it's just small sections; it's like a little play with a bit of dance here and there. With theatre, it's months of preparation. Theatre is a lot more work but it's more gratifying when the show goes up, because I'm part of the editing process. Doing TV was really fun, but I had no say in how [the number] looked in the end, so that was disappointing. They're just totally different beasts, but there are aspects of both that I love. That inner drive to control the editing process has led Molinari to some invigorating projects as choreographer and director, including the '80s throwback show Totally Tubular Time Machine with Debbie Gibson (Janine and I squeal over our mutual fondness for the icon, who's apparently the nicest person on the face of the planet) and this year's The Wildest, a revue based on the music of Louis Prima. Now Janine plans to take that control to the next level with her upcoming webseries Tap Out of It, an affectionate parody of life at DMO. I play 'Gina Marinara,' and there are actors playing all the different teachers. The series is basically the different experiences we have when we're getting ready for a show coming to Broadway, what happens when we get closer and closer to callbacks -- that's really what we're about here, getting the kids ready. But each webisode is going to be two to three minutes long and it will show off the kids' comic chops. We're poking fun at what we do and laughing at it. Molinari's buoyant approach to dance and life has come in handy outside of the studio too; she constantly uses her art for community outreach, doing cabarets to benefit the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen and New Jersey's Popcorn Park Zoo, hosting a summer residency at the 92nd Street Y, and overseeing DMO's program Sole 2 Sole, which grants scholarships and donates tap shoes to underprivileged young artists.  ""I felt [DMO] needed a way to give back to the community,"" Janine explains. ""I started Sole 2 Sole because I wanted the kids to see how performing can touch the lives of those who can't afford to go to a Broadway show."" Janine knows the transformative power of performance better than anyone. Ultimately, it all comes down to love of the game and love of thy neighbors. ""I have a ton of kids who do great things,"" she says. ""They're really supportive of each other and they applaud when someone gets something. [Performing is] a hard living, but it should be part of their learning process and it should be fun."" And as long as there are teachers like Janine Molinari to encourage our young dreamers, you can bet it will be."
POLITICS,"A Republican vying for the Georgia governor’s seat thinks the rationale behind the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) decision to drop “boy” from one of its program’s names would have led to America’s defeat by Nazi Germany in World War II. Georgia state Sen. Michael Williams, a candidate in this month’s gubernatorial primary, made the unusual connection in an angry statement on Thursday, a day after the 108-year-old organization announced that its youth “Boy Scouts” program would be renamed “Scouts BSA” to reflect its new gender-inclusive policies. Williams blasted the organization for caving to “left-wing social engineers who want to remove the concept of male masculinity from society,” suggesting that if people had been supportive of such a name change during World War II, the United States would have been taken over by Nazis.  “Liberals tell us that masculinity is ‘toxic’ and that girls can be boys and boys should no longer be boys,” he said. “Imagine the outcome of World War II if the Greatest Generation had been raised by these politically correct bedwetters. You’d be reading this in German.” The BSA did not have an immediate reaction to the comments from Williams, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump who touts being Georgia’s first elected official to endorse the president’s campaign in 2015.   The BSA’s name change is the organization’s latest effort to embrace inclusivity. In 2014, it lifted a ban on gay youth within the organization. A year later, it lifted a long-time ban on gay adults serving as employees or volunteers.

POLITICS,"Lobbyists and a well-connected GOP political backer played outsized roles in shaping Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt’s travel plans, according to new reports. Pruitt, already the target of multiple investigations for lavish spending and possible ethics violations, relied on the same lobbyist who helped plan a controversial trip to Morocco in December to arrange details of travel to Australia earlier last year, CNN reported on Thursday. Additionally, Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate and GOP backer, played a major role in helping shape Pruitt’s planned trip to Israel in February, The Washington Post reported. It’s very unusual for a person outside government to arrange travel plans for a Cabinet official, ethics experts have noted, and some critics have questioned whether Pruitt violated federal law by recruiting lobbyists and friends for this role. Public officials are prohibited from using their position to financially benefit friends.  The Post reported that Pruitt had been enlisting “well-connected friends and political allies” to help plan overseas travel since he took office. “Pruitt drew up a list of at least a dozen countries he hoped to visit and urged aides to help him find official reasons to travel,” the paper added. Reports earlier this week revealed that Pruitt relied heavily on a longtime friend and former Comcast lobbyist, Richard Smotkin, to help plan his expensive trip to Morocco. Smotkin reportedly was hired as a lobbyist by the Moroccan government shortly after Pruitt’s visit, raising questions about whether the embattled EPA chief’s trip served to benefit Smotkin financially. Smotkin also was involved in Pruitt planned trip to Australia last year, according to CNN. The lobbyist played a “critical” role in connecting the EPA head to Matthew Freedman, treasurer of the business lobby group the American Australian Council, and intended to travel to Australia with Pruitt, according to the report. Freedman reportedly also was involved in planning the Australia trip and conferred with Pruitt’s staff to arrange the EPA chief’s schedule and talking points. Freedman suggested to Pruitt’s aides that the Institute of Public Affairs, a climate skeptic think tank, serve as co-host of Pruitt’s visit, reported The Guardian this week, citing emails recently released to the Sierra Club under the Freedom of Information Act. The Australia visit, which had been slated to take place around September 2017, was eventually canceled. The EPA said at the time that Hurricane Harvey had derailed Pruitt’s travel schedule. The planned trip to Israel in February was canceled days before the EPA head was scheduled to leave, after news broke that Pruitt’s first-class travel had cost taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars.  An Adelson associate reportedly met with two Pruitt aides to discuss the Israel itinerary in the days leading up to Pruitt’s departure. Adelson was said to have helped connect Pruitt with Water-Gen, an Israeli water purification company that makes products the EPA recently agreed to test.  On Thursday, Democratic lawmakers wrote to the EPA administrator calling for more details about “the role Mr. Adelson or other non-governmental officials played” in the agreement with Water-Gen and the planned trip to Israel. How influential outsiders have played a role in Pruitt's travel, after he charted at least a dozen countries he wanted to visit over the course of a year. W/ @brady_dennis https://t.co/FSpjZg1iCt Pruitt is already facing multiple federal investigations into his spending and potential ethics lapses, including a $50-a-night condo he rented from the wife of an energy lobbyist.  The New York Times reported Thursday that Pruitt secretly purchased a home with a lobbyist when he was a state senator in Oklahoma. The lobbyist at the time was pushing changes in workers’ compensation rules that Pruitt championed in the legislature, according to the report. Amid the storm of scandals, three of Pruitt’s top aides ― his top spokeswoman, a top aide on toxic cleanups and the head of his security detail ― abruptly resigned this week.

BUSINESS,"We are in the midst of a number of fundamental changes in the nature of work and in the way we spend our time when we’re not working. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce now accounts for about 8.9% of all retail sales, a number that continues to grow; second quarter 2017 e-commerce sales were about 5% higher than first quarter sales. More of what we buy is bought online, but we are also buying less merchandise. Rents for commercial real estate continue to decline and it is obvious that we have a lot of empty storefronts in well-off parts of New York City and in shopping malls around America. More and more of our time is spent doing things rather than accumulating things.  About 80% of the U.S. GDP and the U.S. employment market is in the service sector of the economy. In fact, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis: Americans spend a growing amount of their time making and consuming services. From physical therapy to movies, from concerts to nail salons, American’s consumption patterns are changing. As a proportion of our total consumption, food, clothing and other merchandise are declining while services are growing. It’s not that we no longer require material possessions, but that the nature and style of consumption is changing. Real estate development is beginning to reflect the growth of e-commerce and the service economy. One victim of this change is the suburban shopping mall. This past spring, Hayley Peterson of Business Insider observed that: The real estate industry has taken note of these changes by repurposing existing malls and cancelling or scaling back new ones. In a Wall Street Journal article published last week, Keiko Morris reported that: While many people remain attracted to single family, detached homes and separation of residential and commercial space, a growing number of young people are attracted to more walkable environments where they can live, work and shop in a single area. Walking, biking or hopping on a train seem to be viable alternatives to sitting in endless and growing traffic jams. Hanging out in a public park seems to be a reasonable alternative to mowing the lawn. With the growth of global commerce and communication, we have seen a degree of homogenization of material goods and commercial experiences. One reaction to that trend is a desire to find or build local communities of distinct character. A “Main Street” style of commercial development doesn’t require two big anchor department stores and dozens of national chains. It can evolve over time and adjust its mix of residential, commercial and business spaces. Commercial space can be priced to enable small, distinct local retail shops. A sense of place is difficult to convey within a giant enclosed space surrounded by acres of parking lots. Malls tend to all look the same because their economic function and business model dictate a particular design. Main street type developments, like cities, can evolve over time and take into account local needs, markets, culture and geography. The density achieved through these Main Street developments makes it possible to achieve the economy of scale required for new infrastructure that is environmentally sustainable. Microgrids can be installed to permit the use of renewable energy and ensure energy efficiency. This can reduce the cost of a development’s operation and maintenance.  Microgrids also provide resiliency because they can operate when the central grid is blacked- out. The use of permeable surfaces such as plantings in street medians, green roofs and unpaved parklands can reduce flood impacts while creating an amenity. The development’s design can take drainage into account and take advantage of the natural contours of the land. The cost effectiveness of water supply, sewage treatment and waste management can be enhanced by carefully designed, concentrated urban developments. The trend toward a sharing economy is also facilitated by urban density. Sharing clothing, cars, furniture and other material goods is easier when people live close together. The cultural switch from material consumption as a means rather than an end is well underway, and sharing material goods enables a less resource intensive economy. It is gradually becoming less socially desirable to be seen laden with shopping bags at the mall. That sort of Kardashian-like behavior is seen by some as a form of gluttony. If the goods you really need are delivered to your home in over-packed Amazon boxes, then the act of “shopping” is no longer recreation, but simply a less notable chore required to obtain a commodity.  This social change toward urbanization and different forms of consumption is never uniform and older people in particular cling to their familiar and comfortable lifestyles. In the United States the price of housing remains the one material possession that still requires a substantial part of a family’s annual income. In many parts of the country, the best housing buys are in the outer rings of suburbia where single family development and the auto culture is the norm. That pattern will persist and will probably be reinforced once electric cars become cheaper and more reliable than internal combustion powered vehicles. But even in these areas we are seeing multi-story condo-style development and Main Street-alternatives to traditional malls. The pull of a new cultural norm, experiencing rather than consuming, could be long lasting. Its physical manifestation in patterns of land use development is difficult to predict. Environmentalists and climate activists often make the case that consumption of some material goods must be sacrificed on the altar of environmental sustainability. SUVs, motorboats, and red meat are typical targets. Opposing consumption that people like is politically perilous, particularly if that case is being made by well-educated coastal elites. It can come off as particularly arrogant when seen through the eyes of an out-of-work or underemployed Midwestern factory worker, who would love to have the problem of over-consumption. The issue is avoided if the trend toward different rather than less consumption holds.  While it’s never a good idea to predict the future, the growth of the service economy, the impact of e-commerce on real estate development, and the growth of the sharing economy are each undeniable. New technologies will continue to change consumption patterns, land use and social norms. We don’t know what shape it will take, but I believe we have an opportunity to ensure these changes result in an exciting sustainable life style in a new type of sustainable city."
POLITICS,"The Trump administration on Monday proposed rolling back a 2015 rule that bans aggressive predator control tactics in national preserves in Alaska, including shooting bear cubs and wolf pups in their dens ― a move immediately blasted by environmental groups.  The proposal, slated to be published Tuesday in the Federal Register, would amend the National Park Service’s current regulations to again allow for controversial sport hunting and trapping techniques on roughly 20 million acres of federal lands in Alaska. The park service, part of the Department of the Interior, said lifting the prohibitions would increase hunting opportunities on national preserve land, as Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke called for in a pair of secretarial orders last year.  The proposed rule would allow hunters to lure brown and black bears with bait, hunt black bears and their cubs using artificial lights, shoot bear cubs and wolf and coyote pups in their dens, and use dogs to hunt black bears. It would also allow hunters to shoot swimming caribou from motorboats.  Environmental groups voiced disgust at the attempt to strip away protections.  “I’m outraged that [President Donald] Trump and his trophy-hunting cronies are promoting the senseless slaughter of Alaska’s most iconic wildlife,” said Collette Adkins, a lawyer and biologist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Cruel and harmful hunting methods like killing bear cubs and their mothers near dens have no place on our national preserves.” Defenders of Wildlife said the 2015 park service rule prevented “extreme methods of killing predators.” “The Trump administration has somehow reached a new low in protecting wildlife,” said Jamie Rappaport Clark, the nonprofit’s president and CEO. “Allowing the killing of bear cubs and wolf pups in their dens is barbaric and inhumane. The proposed regulations cast aside the very purpose of national parks to protect wildlife and wild places.” The park service said in an emailed statement the proposed rule would “establish consistency” with state regulations.  “The conservation of wildlife and habitat for future generations is a goal we share with Alaska,” agency regional director Bert Frost said. A 60-day public comment period begins Tuesday.  The proposal comes a little more than a year after Congress approved a measure to repeal an Obama-era rule that largely banned hunting of Alaska’s most iconic predators in Alaska’s national wildlife refuges. The Republican-sponsored legislation opened the door for the state to resume aggressive predator control tactics, including shooting bears and wolves from airplanes, on more than 76 million acres of refuge land.  Trump signed that bill into law in April 2017.

ARTS & CULTURE,"After Milo Yiannopoulos, former Twitter creep and current editor at the notorious alt-right news platform Breitbart that is favored by white nationalists, announced yesterday he’d signed a $250,000 book deal with Simon & Schuster’s conservative Threshold imprint, the backlash was immediate.  “YUCK AND BOO AND GROSS,” responded comedian Sarah Silverman on Twitter. Shannon Coulter, marketing specialist and founder of the Ivanka Trump boycott campaign #GrabYourWallet, tweeted, “[Simon & Schuster] are you concerned $250k book deal you gave Milo Yiannopoulos will read as condoning the racist harassment [Leslie Jones] endured?”  Soon, however, pushback against the publisher transitioned from simple outrage to calls for organized resistance. One literary journal announced a boycott on coverage in 2017: In response to this disgusting validation of hate, we will not cover a single @simonschuster book in 2017. https://t.co/NAJhTgdeyX An indie bookstore also tweeted that it would not be stocking Simon & Schuster titles thanks to the Yiannopoulos deal:  Sometimes it's a tough call for bookshops between respecting free speech and not promoting hate speech. Sometimes not. Byebye @simonschuster https://t.co/nxTFS34Y1b Some readers tweeted their agreement, noting that they couldn’t give their money to a publisher that supported Yiannopoulos’ message. Even Judd Apatow chimed in. Threshold, an imprint specifically tailored to conservative nonfiction, has published books such as Donald Trump’s Crippled America, but a boycott of Simon & Schuster would likely hit hardest the authors from other, more diverse imprints not directly associated with this dustup, given that liberal boycotters were unlikely at any point to buy books from the right-leaning line.  Writer and book publicist Kima Jones pointed out in a tweet that a broad boycott of the entire, diverse Simon & Schuster catalog would harm the careers of many writers of color, in the name of standing against white nationalism: Not reviewing black writers and writers of color with 2017 @simonschuster titles is going to dismantle white supremacy how? Writer Tanya Contois suggested specifically boycotting Threshold, while buying, reviewing and promoting books from the diverse Salaam imprint at Simon & Schuster. But a few creatives now unwillingly associated with Yiannopoulos are choosing to pressure the publisher instead, declaring they would rather sever their professional relationships with the company than be on the same payroll. Emmett Plant, a producer who worked on more than 20 “Star Trek” audiobooks for CBS/Paramount, tweeted that he’d produced his last for them. (Simon & Schuster is a division of CBS Corporation.) Simon and Schuster gave Milo a book deal. Cool. Who has two thumbs and will never produce Star Trek for them ever again? This guy. I'm out. Writer Danielle Henderson, whose memoir The Ugly Cry is slated for publication by Simon & Schuster in 2018, revealed in a series of tweets that she was so outraged by her publisher’s new author that she was prepared to walk away from the deal if necessary: I'm looking at my @simonschuster contract, and unfortunately there's no clause for ""what if we decide to publish a white nationalist"" But know this: i'm well aware of what hill I am willing to die on, and my morals and values are at the top of that list. I will happily go back to slinging coffee—I'm not afraid to stand for what I believe in, and I make a MEAN cappuccino foam She also pointed out that the publisher had fought hard to win her book, which has been optioned, and that they offered her a larger contract than Yiannopoulos. This likely gives her more clout, and more options, than many other authors at Simon & Schuster, though more established authors at the publisher have remained silent as of yet. Is silence actually the best response? Lisa Lucas, executive director of the National Book Foundation, seems to think so: Outrage helps sell books. Utter silence is what kills them. In a post-Trump election era, however, many on the left must be wondering where the line between a chilling silence and the silence of tacit acceptance falls."
POLITICS,"Last winter, Erik sent a message to 20 of his least favorite porn stars, YouTube celebrities and “Insta-gays.” “So are you like a real person or just another shallow empty fuckboy who works in an industry that props up unrealistic gay male beauty/sex standards and wouldn’t be caught dead with anyone below pornboy looks?” Erik isn’t his real name. He’s 28 years old, he works for the government, he lives in the Midwest and that’s as specific as I’m going to get. “Speaking objectively,” he says when I ask him to describe himself, “I’m pear-shaped. I’ve got a tummy, man-titties and a big squishy butt. I also have a nice haircut, a clean face and a nice smile.” I met Erik a few months ago, right around the time his flurry of porn-star trolling reached its zenith. He read my article about gay loneliness and messaged me to say that it resonated. “I feel like a failure as a gay guy,” he wrote, “because I’m 28 and I haven’t had much sexual experience even though I’ve been out since I was 18.” The more I got to know Erik, the more familiar his story sounded. For years I’ve lurked on message boards for self-described “incels” — “involuntary celibates,” men who think they’ve been unjustly denied sex. What I heard from Erik were the same resentments, the same hurts, the same mixture of jealousy and desire I had scrolled through on Reddit.  With, of course, one crucial difference. The incels we’ve heard of — Elliot Rodger, who killed six people in Isla Vista in 2014, and Alek Minassian, who mowed down 10 people in Toronto last month — were both mass killers. Erik, even at the darkest points of his “incel-ar period,” as he calls it, says he never contemplated anything violent.  But his experience — how he gathered contempt for the people he wanted to sleep with and, eventually, got over it — says a lot about what’s really behind the incel phenomenon and why it seems to be getting worse.  Erik’s radicalization began five years ago, when his family fell behind on bills and he had to take a second job to help them catch up. “I didn’t have the time or the money to go out and meet people because I was always working,” he says. He was 23 years old, living with his parents, doing day shifts at a big-box retail store and nights at a call center, dialing for political donations. “I felt isolated and alone and crippled. The resentment started with myself. I would think, ‘What did you do to deserve this?’ Then the self-loathing became loathing of everyone around me: ‘Why am I propping up this family?’” He describes a widening circle of resentment. He had no time for dates and no car for hookups. His first (and only) sexual experience had been a one-night stand, some dude he met on Facebook while studying abroad. His attempts at flirting in bars ended badly. One guy, whom Erik describes as “diva-pretty,” once told him, “I wouldn’t even rape you.” He had started to think of the men he was attracted to — “slim, pretty-faced guys who looked like they had a lot of money, who lived that West Hollywood lifestyle, who could eat whatever they wanted and never gain a single pound” — as the cause of his failures. They were shallow, superficial, hoarding status and sex and power and denying it to him. “The ones I hated the most,” he says, “were the gorgeous, white, rich gay men on Instagram saying, ‘You’ve just got to love your body’ or ‘It’s not about what’s on the outside.’ I would be like, fuck you. You don’t know what it’s like to be rejected. You haven’t weighed more than 100 pounds in the last 30 years.” I tell Erik that he doesn’t strike me as the kind of guy who would actually enjoy the “West Hollywood” lifestyle all that much. VIP rooms, bottle service, duckface selfies? “Weren’t you just telling me that your ideal gay bar was somewhere you could wear a tux and sing show tunes?” I ask. “It was more about attaining status than finding love or even sex,” he says. “Even though I didn’t actually want the lifestyle they were broadcasting, I wanted to feel worthy of having it — as affirmed by others. I wanted to be the alpha male.” What’s at the heart of Erik’s experience, and the incel phenomenon more generally, says Jennifer Bosson, a masculinity researcher at the University of South Florida, is the concept of “precarious masculinity.”  “Manhood is conceptualized as something that has to be earned,” she said. “And once you earn it, you have to defend it. It can be lost.” Look at almost any culture, she adds, and you’ll find that men, as a group, have higher status than women. But within men there are huge disparities. Cars, clothes, jawlines: Some guys have them and some don’t. For the have-nots, it feels like they’re not reaping the benefits of being in the dominant group, like they’re being denied what’s owed to them. “When women lack power we’re just like, ‘Oh I’m a woman,’” Bosson says. “When men lack power, they’re like, ‘Hey, this isn’t fair.’” In other words, the incel phenomenon has nothing to do with sex — duh — and everything to do with entitlement. My personal theory is that it was the online forums, the constantly updated cheering section of like-minded misanthropes, that turned people like Minassian into monsters. Though he doesn’t know of any dedicated message boards for gay incels, Erik still managed to find places where he could voice his resentments and get them reflected back to him. His forum of choice, he says, was “the scariest place on the Internet: The YouTube comments section.” He found articles and videos that critiqued gay male beauty standards, then scrolled down until he found snark and resentments that echoed his own. “It’s like, hey, this person is dejected and unfucked as well. We have something in common, we can share our loathing of people we perceive to be the problem.” He shows me screenshots of what this looked like. “Your issues with body image are not the same as those of objectively ugly people, like myself,” is how one of the comments on a YouTube video begins. Another, a Twitter thread, starts with a message to a model tweeting about his mental illness: “how nice of a conventionally hot/pretty boy to tell us regular folk with our plain looks, mediocre sex lives, & non-Adonis figures such Noble sentiments.” Seeing these echoes of his own experience, he says, felt like relief, like he wasn’t alone anymore. The more he built fellowship with the guys from the comment threads, the more he started to see his life in us-versus-them terms. He started celebrating the misfortunes of his online enemies. “Someone posts about their breakup on social media and I’d be like, ‘Oh look, the pretty person feels sad. They have no chance of getting anyone else, boo hoo.’” Some of the people he met online actually seemed happy, cheering on the misfortune of the pretty people, he says. Teach that narcissistic little fucker that life doesn’t revolve around him. “I was being just as judgmental and shallow as I thought the enemy was,” he reflects. “The irony never occurred to me.” Curtis Puryear, a colleague of Bosson’s who specializes in online radicalization, tells me Erik followed a fairly typical pattern. Whether online or offline, being around like-minded people tends to result in having stronger views. Whether you’re a vegetarian or someone who thinks “Crash” shouldn’t have won an Oscar, being around a bunch of people with the same opinion usually makes you feel it more intensely. The internet, Puryear says, allows you to find people and activate identities you never could if you had to rely on face-to-face interactions. If you live in a small town (like Erik does), it’s pretty hard to find enough fellow incels to form a community. On the internet, though, nearly any identity can become the basis for sharing empathy, information — and grievances. “Feeling like you’re a member of a disadvantaged group brings some psychological benefits,” Puryear continues. “It’s a way to write off failures. You feel like the deck is stacked against you. If you’re an incel and you feel attacked, then that identity will become more important for you over time.”     One of the stories about Elliot Rodger I can’t get out of my head dates back to the summer before his shooting rampage. Rodger saw a group of women playing kickball in a park. According to Ralph W. Larkin’s “Learning to Be a Rampage Shooter,” Rodger immediately left, bought a Super Soaker, filled it with orange juice and came back. He ran onto the field and hosed down the players. He had no goal other than ruining their fun. “They deserved to die horrible, painful deaths,” he wrote later about the women, “just for the crime of enjoying a better life than me.” I ask Erik whether he ever lashed out like this, even in small ways. He says he didn’t. He tells me that when his co-workers used to complain about gaining weight, he would ask them if they wanted to trade bodies with him.  “It was my way of saying, ‘Shut up, I don’t want to hear any complaining from conventionally attractive people,’” he says. Pretty dickish, he admits, but a far cry from even the warning signs of the violence that people like Rodger have carried out. I ask Bosson about this, whether something about gayness keeps gay men from lashing out the way straight men do. She points out, first, that only a small percentage of men are gay — maybe there’s fewer gay mass shooters because there’s fewer of us overall.    And it’s not like gayness grants immunity from masculinity norms. “We see the same valorizing of ‘straight-acting’ and stigmatization of femininity in gay men that we see in straight men,” Bosson says, confirming what you already know if you’ve spent more than five minutes on Grindr.  And masculinity is inextricably linked to violence. Bosson’s lab runs studies where they threaten men’s status by making them braid a mannequin’s hair or telling them they got “a typical female score” on a knowledge test. Afterward, the men hit a punching bag harder and blasted their fellow research subjects (well, a simulation of them) with higher levels of punitive white noise than men whose masculinity hadn’t been challenged. “If you threaten men’s sense of their gender status and make them feel for a moment that they’re not a real man, they lash out,” she says. For men who feel like their sense of masculinity is under constant threat — like being unemployed or, ahem, not getting laid — it may take smaller and smaller threats to provoke their anger. It took a response from his targets for Erik’s five-year “incel-ar period” to become something else. While most of the porn stars and Insta-gays blocked him after he sent them the “fuckboy” message, some replied. “I am poor as fuck,” one of them wrote. “About to lose my cheap apartment. I have til the end of the month to move out. Looks are not everything.” Erik shows me screenshots. “Sorry,” he replied. “It’s just ... it must be nice to be gay and hot and have some of the best sex on the planet.” “I have not had sex since October of last year. It was not hot or fun,” the porn star wrote. And, to Erik’s apology, “If you continue acting that way, you will have nothing. Like I have nothing.” He got other responses, too. After he copy-pasted his message to a porn producer and got blocked, Erik contacted him on Snapchat to apologize. The producer explained that lots of porn was fake (gasp) and that the actors making it were people, too. Another “enemy” who got Erik’s message posted it on Twitter and said that his life might look perfect on the outside, but he was struggling with drug addiction and had been abandoned by his family. Eric felt traumatized, overwhelmed with guilt over what he had done. That’s when the fog started to lift. “It didn’t make me feel better automatically. But I started to think that if these guys were conventionally attractive and have what I’m supposed to have and they’re still miserable, then maybe I don’t need to worry.” “So the happy ending is that everyone is miserable?” I ask. “No,” he says, “but it’s like I spent years collecting stamps, building up this whining and resentment. When I could have just accepted that I wasn’t in grad school and working these mediocre jobs.”  He’s dating someone now, a retail clerk he met on OKCupid right after he decided to trade Twitter DMs for an OKCupid profile. (“Sneak that into your article somehow,” he says, “from incel to excel.”) They’ve been together two months now, but he’s having trouble shedding his old habits. “I’d like to think I’ve improved and am content now that I found someone who not only I like but who actually thinks I’m beautiful,” he says, “but the envy and resentment are still there.” Envy, he says, because other people still look so attractive. Resentment because he thinks he never will.  Although he’s different than Rodgers and Minassian, Erik’s anger, too, came from a mismatch between expectations and reality: “If this was pre-1980s, maybe I’d feel more different from a straight incel,” he says. “But with the mainstreaming of gay people, the expectations have become more mainstream too. You’re expected to be financially stable, to look a certain way, to have the right partner and the right hookups. When you can’t live up to that image, then the inferiority complex comes.” Erik is the first gay incel I’ve ever met. That doesn’t mean he’ll be the last. "
POLITICS,"Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) on Sunday pushed for arming teachers and reducing the number of entrances into school buildings after the latest mass shooting at a U.S. school afflicted his state. Patrick, a staunch conservative, appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union” and ABC’s “This Week” to discuss responses after a lone gunman opened fire at Santa Fe High School in Santa Fe, Texas, on Friday, killing eight students and two teachers. “There was a teacher next door, a (former) Marine, who saw what was going on... Some feel had he been able to carry a gun, he could have stopped that shooter,” he told host Jake Tapper on the CNN program.  ""We need armed teachers,"" says Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick after school shooting in Santa Fe #CNNSOTU https://t.co/kBp4F9G0AC https://t.co/QLfIuIE3rG Patrick said that as he visited a hospital on Friday night where some of those wounded in the shooting had been treated, students and parents alike said that teachers should be armed.  He told “This Week” host Geroge Stephanopoulos that “our teachers are part of that well-run militia,” a mangled reference to the language of the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment. That amendment says that a “well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” “It’s guns that also stop crimes,” Patrick added. Under a school marshal program in Texas that has been cited approvingly by President Donald Trump, teachers can carry guns on campus, with local officials ultimately making the call on whether that is allowed. Patrick also said that the issue underlying the raft of school shootings plaguing the U.S. isn’t access to guns, but that “it’s about us.” “We have devalued life, whether it’s through abortion, whether it’s the breakup of families, through violent movies, and particularly violent video games which now outsell movies and music,” he said. He also reiterated the suggestion he first made Friday immediately after the shooting that school campuses be redesigned to have fewer entrances.  “We need to get down to one or two entrances to our schools. We have to funnel our students into our schools so we can put eyes on them,” he said.  Even before Friday’s shooting, several Republican politicians, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Sen. Ted Cruz, have been calling for training teachers to carry firearms.  Trump repeatedly pushed that idea after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in which 17 people were killed. This story has been updated with the direct language of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Sandra Oh is tracking down her next assassin, and she wants you along for the ride.  The actress made her debut on Sunday in “Killing Eve,” a new crime drama from BBC America in which she plays Eve Polastri, a security operative who’s yearning for a more exciting life. She soon finds herself hunting down a female assassin named Villanell, played by Jodie Comer.  “It has this blend of drama, of thriller, but also of this demented naughtiness with an English spin on it,” Oh told HuffPost at Build Series. “I was like, ‘What is that?’ I can see it from the page. And I felt aligned to her voice. So that was really why I wanted to delve in.” Throughout the 8-episode season, Eve and Villanelle become obsessed with each other as they engage in a large-scale game of cat and mouse. “Our characters spend a lot of time apart but thinking of the other,” she said. This isn’t your typical assassin and spy show, Oh pointed out.  “Both of the characters really upend the stereotype,” she said. “Villanelle is not constantly a femme fatale. She’s devious and ridiculous. And Eve is not in a procedural hunting down a killer. The characters are layered, and it’s great to play a wide range of emotions.”  “Killing Eve” marks Oh’s first major primetime leading role since leaving “Grey’s Anatomy” in 2014 after Season 10. She had various offers since parting ways with the hit ABC series, but “Killing Eve” felt like the right fit.  “I want to make choices and actually have agency over my life. And as an actor, it sometimes takes a while for that to happen. So, I was very judicious in my choices,” she said. “It’s like falling in love. You may have to date for a while, but when you find the right one, you commit.” She’s particularly glad to serve as a female lead on a show that celebrates inclusion and diversity. Throughout her career, Oh said she feels like she’s been part of that change on both the small and big screens, slow though it may be.  “I always have to believe that the arc bends toward long and it bends toward justice. So I have faith in that and it’s slow,” she said, adding, “It’s part of my life’s work to be a part of that bending. It’s very important to me. I’d say where we are is exactly where we are. And there’s more work to be done and there’s things to celebrate.” “Killing Eve” certainly won’t be the last challenging part Oh will take on. When asked if there’s a role she’d like to play, she said, “I do, I just don’t know what it is yet.” But then she thought about it for a second.  “I will say, I love sci-fi,” Oh continued. “And there are many times where I’m like, ‘I can play an alien. I can play the leader of some universe.’ And I always felt like Asians should be in space. We should be in space. I don’t know why sci-fi doesn’t have more Asians in it. It’s like, hello. We’re at the forefront of technology. That genre has always interested me.”  Until then, Oh is thrilled that “Killing Eve” has already been picked up for Season 2.  “We want to know what happens to these characters. And it’s just settled. I really wanted a second season,” she said. “And now that I know, I can relax, go into the work and go into preparing.” “Killing Eve” airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET on BBC America.

ARTS & CULTURE," Fortaleza, Brazil-- where Hélio Oiticica: Estructura Corpo Cor (Structure Body Color) is on view through May 1 at the University of Fortaleza's Espaço Cultural Airton Queiroz FOR A MEETING last week, I flew three-and-a-half hours from São Paulo to Fortaleza, a beautiful city located in Brazil's northeast, and once more I was struck by how vast, rich and diverse this nation is. Geographically, the country is approximately the same size as continental United States, and though I've visited Brazil more than a hundred times, I'd never, until this trip, visited Fortaleza, the country's fifth-largest city. Brazilians in the nation's huge metropolitan areas of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro sometimes make disparaging remarks about nordestinos, the people from the northeast, thinking of them as poor and under-educated. But even a brief visit puts those slurs to rest. I'm so glad that I no longer think about Fortaleza as a fly-over city! Facing the ocean, Fortaleza has a hyper-modern skyline of sparkling high-rise buildings-- think Toronto-meets-Miami Beach. Its multiracial population of more than three million drives a robust and diverse economy. And Fortaleza is a big tourist destination for the domestic Brazilian market. People are drawn by its tropical climate whose high humidity is made manageable due to its steady, pleasant ocean breezes. From a tourist's standpoint, the city serves up beautiful beaches, a fine cuisine, a world-class soccer stadium that put it in the FIFA World Cup series, a range of diverse music attractions and museums, and some of Brazil's most important universities and research centers. On my visit, I had the pleasure of touring the 25,000-student campus of the University of Fortaleza. This included a visit to the Espaço Cultural Airton Queiroz to view Hélio Oiticica: Estructura Corpo Cor (Structure Body Color), a superb retrospective-like exhibition of sixty works. Unquestionably one of Brazil's most important artists--whose influence is felt in the U.S. and in Europe-- Hélio Oiticica had a diverse and active practice through to his death in 1980. The exhibition's curators Celso Favaretto and Paula Braga take you on his journey from formal, geometric abstract painting of the 1950s to three-dimensional abstractions in the early '60s and progressively more ephemeral, dynamic and performance-oriented works of the '70s.   Above, installation views, Hélio Oiticica: Estructura Corpo Cor (Structure Body Color), at the University of Fortaleza's Espaço Cultural Airton Queiroz Physically, the exhibition space acts like a three-pointed star that nicely complements a reading of the artist's development-- as one wing presents the collaged sense of the relationship between his beautiful abstract paintings from the Metaesquema series, Oiticica's floating Spatial Relief sculptures, and performative boxes called Bólide; another wing draws out the relationship between the floating sculptures and his costumed performance works known as Parangolés, which are essentially wearable abstract paintings. Less familiar for me were the Bólide, and I came to really enjoy these performance boxes that might be described as the kind of Cornell box that would be made by a lunatic clown. One of my favorite bólide in this exhibition included a photo of a fallen figure and a small version of the artist's famous red banner with the words  ""Seja marginal, seja herói"" (""Be an outsider, be a hero""), which is quite possibly one of my Top Ten favorite contemporary art works. Below, Hélio Oiticica: Seja marginal seja herói (Be an outlaw be a hero), 1968; ink on cloth  The exhibition's third wing is devoted to one of Oiticica's Cosmococas--a series of immersive, multimedia installations in which viewers, said the artist, may ""discover their inner creative center, their dormant expressive spontaneity, subject to daily life."" There is something simply joyous in witnessing Oiticica's work, as he constantly engages us-- by inviting us to dress up and perform, or simply hang out in a mattress-filled ""chill-out"" lounge featuring photo projections and Jimi Hendrix songs. This entire show is a crowd-pleaser for audiences of all ages. Even a curmudgeon will leave with a smile. The show continues through May 1st. I don't know how many of you will be able to consider Fortaleza on your next trip to Brazil, but you should...! Hélio Oiticica: Estructura Corpo Cor

POLITICS,"Conservative pundit Tomi Lahren attempted on Saturday night to defend controversial remarks from White House chief of staff John Kelly by rewriting American history to claim low-skilled immigrants have no place in the U.S. “You don’t just come into this country with low skills, low education, not understanding the language and come into our country because someone says it makes them feel nice. That’s not what this country is based on,” Lahren said in an appearance on Fox News, adding: “We don’t believe in importing poverty.” In fact, the historic waves of immigration that created modern America included many low-skilled non-English speakers ― whether from southern and eastern Europe, or from Asia, Africa and South America ― whose descendants are now integral parts of U.S. society.  .@TomiLahren: ""You don't just come into this country with low skills, low education, not understanding the language and come into our country because someone says it makes them feel nice. That's not what this country is based on."" @WattersWorld pic.twitter.com/Dux0cABHar Research shows that today’s immigrants are more likely to have advanced degrees, less likely to commit crimes, and are good for the economy in general ― including by raising wages for the native-born.  Kelly, formerly Trump’s homeland security secretary, sparked debate over the issue of immigrants’ abilities earlier this week when NPR released a transcript of an interview in which he argued that most people moving into the U.S. illegally are not capable of becoming part of American society: The vast majority of the people that move illegally into United States are not bad people. But they’re also not people that would easily assimilate into the United States into our modern society. They’re overwhelmingly rural people in the countries they come from ― fourth, fifth, sixth grade educations are kind of the norm. They don’t speak English, obviously that’s a big thing. They don’t speak English. They don’t integrate well, they don’t have skills. They’re not bad people. They’re coming here for a reason. And I sympathize with the reason. But the laws are the laws. Kelly’s remarks came days after the Trump administration further tightened immigration law enforcement by canceling deportation protections for Hondurans who fled a 1998 hurricane. That move pushed the number of immigrants formerly under temporary protected status and now in jeopardy to over 1 million. Days later, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the U.S. would adopt an official policy of criminally prosecuting people trying to enter the country illegally, meaning parents would be separated from their children on a large scale. “The children will be taken care of — put into foster care or whatever,” Kelly told NPR. Immigrant rights advocates slammed Kelly’s comments, and The Washington Post noted that he is personally descended from Irish and Italian immigrants, some of whom didn’t speak English for years while living in the U.S. “Kelly somehow nonetheless wound up as the top aide to the president of the United States,” the Post’s Philip Bump wrote. Lahren herself appears to be the descendant of an immigrant born in the Russian Empire who forged an immigration document to try to secure his status. “I bring this to light not to shame or embarrass Tomi Lahren,” journalist Jennifer Mendelsohn wrote. “It means he may have been a good man who made a bad decision under pressure. It means you’d hope his great-great-granddaughter would have empathy for the plight of immigrants rather than try to pull up the ladder behind her.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,"In 1970, 26-year-old lawyer Sarah Weddington tried her first-ever contested case before the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. It was Roe v. Wade. Most Americans alre aware of the Supreme Court’s 1973 verdict in the watershed case, but fewer know the women who got us there.  Lisa Loomer’s play “Roe,” running now at Washington, D.C.’s Arena Stage, tells the story of the case that established a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion through the lens of two people: the young and ambitious lawyer Weddington and the case’s plaintiff Norma McCorvey, a 20-something bartender and lesbian who, in court, was known by the legal pseudonym “Jane Roe.”  In 2013, Loomer was approached by a friend about the possibility of writing a play about the case as part of a cycle of performances called “American Revolutions,” each recreating a moment of change in American history, commissioned by the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Given Loomer’s previous work with narratives centered around women’s struggles, Roe v. Wade was of obvious interest.  “I was interested in the case, yes, but I was also interested in why this case is still being argued 44 years later,” Loomer explained in an interview with The Huffington Post. “I wanted to understand why we, as Americans, cannot even talk to each other about this issue. In other words, I was interested in the divide in this country, and I thought that by looking at the divide over Roe, I might begin to look at the larger cultural divide, as well. Which is, ironically, what we are looking at right now, post-election.” After an initial run in Oregon, the play premiered in D.C., just days before Donald Trump’s inauguration. Before the election, Loomer imagined the production existing in a different context. “We imagined it happening during the inauguration of our first woman president,” she said. “We thought it would be a cautionary tale, as history should be, but also a celebration of how far women’s rights and human rights have come,” she added. “Clearly, we were surprised. The play is happening now in a totally different political climate.”  The unexpected turn of events made “Roe” and its implications even more urgent, as Roe v. Wade’s ruling is now under unprecedented threat. One of Trump’s first actions as president was reinstating Ronald Reagan’s abortion “global gag rule,” which bans health organizations around the world receiving U.S. funding from mentioning abortion as a family planning option. And last week, Trump met with Judge William Pryor as a potential Supreme Court Justice, a man who called Roe v. Wade the “worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.”  In writing “Roe,” however, Loomer’s mission was never to convince her audience of the importance of abortion to women’s liberation. Rather, she wanted to tell the complex story of the iconic court case with tolerance and compassion, giving voice and credence to both parties.  “I did not want it to be a polemic,” Loomer said. “I did not want to further the divide. I feel that theater is a place where people — all kinds of people — can come together in the dark to look at an issue from a human point of view.  Theater is a place to feel. To laugh, cry, be surprised, and to live in another’s shoes for a while.”  Loomer tells her story through two protagonists: Weddington and McCorvey. At first, the women worked together on the case as allies. Yet, after the verdict, McCorvey became a born-again Christian and an anti-abortion activist. Weddington continued to champion women’s right to choose. “Their divergent journeys,” Loomer said, are representative of a broader picture. “Once I saw that odd turn of events, I thought it was a chance to tell the story of the cultural divide and look at why we can’t talk to each other as Americans.” In “Roe,” Loomer depicts the complex web of biases, fears and personal motivations that all humans grapple with regardless of their political affiliations. She also seamlessly highlights the effects that race, class and sexual orientation have on one’s opportunities and worldview. As a result, no minister, activist or millennial is stereotyped. There are no clear heroes or villains, just people ― messy, dedicated, and trying to do what’s right. During the play’s Washington run, Loomer speculates that most, but not all, of her audience leans liberal. Yet she’s received feedback from viewers on both sides of the political spectrum who appreciated seeing a nuanced and respectful picture of the other point of view. “Most people say that they went in very firmly sure of their stance, and they left sure of their stance, as well,” Loomer said of audience members who identified as both pro-choice and anti-abortion. “It didn’t change their mind, but it gave them an appreciation of the other side. For the first time, there was another side.”  In the future, Loomer hopes to take “Roe” to a theater in the southern United States, where the audience’s political breakdown would likely shift. The goal, again, isn’t to change minds, but to raise the possibility of open dialogue.  “My best hope is always compassion, a reverence for the complexity of human beings,” she said. “I think we can use that compassion now. I know it’s a time when people are extremely angry, and the last thing they want is to be asked to show compassion. Unfortunately, I just don’t know another way of even beginning to bridge this terrible divide in our country except for just listening to the other side. Just hearing it.” She also hopes to reach the young people in the audience, those who thought Roe v. Wade was another generation’s story. As Loomer said: “I think that people come away from the play with a deeper understanding of what is at stake, right now, in terms of choice.” “Roe,” a co-production with Oregon Shakespeare Festival and Berkeley Repertory Theatre, is written by Lisa Loomer and directed by Bill Rauch. It is on view until February 19, 2017 at Arena Stage in Washington, D.C.  Correction: An earlier edition of this article misspelled the playright’s name as Loomey. We regret the error. "
ENTERTAINMENT,"Are you ready for “A Quiet Place 2: Even Quieter?” That probably won’t be the name of the sequel to “A Quiet Place,” but all that matters now is that it’s actually happening.  Paramount Pictures has broken its silence on a follow-up to the surprise box office smash, announcing on Wednesday that a sequel to the John Krasinski-directed horror flick with Emily Blunt is officially a go.  “We’re thrilled to say that we’re already working on the sequel to ‘A Quiet Place,’” chairman-CEO Jim Gianopulos said at CinemaCon on Wednesday, according to The Hollywood Reporter.  “If you told me five years ago that an almost silent film starring the very funny guy Jim from ‘The Office’ would have been a hit at Paramount, I would have said, ‘Well, I should go work at Paramount,’” he added. Warning: Spoilers for “A Quiet Place” below! “A Quiet Place,” which follows a family living in constant fear of noise-sensitive monsters, raked in $213.3 million at the global box office on a $17 million budget. The film’s ending easily paves the way for future films, with Blunt’s character and her daughter discovering how to defeat the creatures who’ve wiped out most of the human race. Screenwriters Bryan Woods and Scott Beck previously spoke about how a sequel might look beyond the characters introduced in the first film. “It’s such a fun world,“ Woods told Fandango. “There are so many things you could do.” “There are so many discarded set pieces, too, just hiding out on Word documents on our computer,” Beck added. “So, yeah, there are certainly so many stories you could tell. It’s just really, at the end of the day, who are the characters in this and what does this situation mean to that dynamic?” There’s no word on whether Krasinski will direct, as he’s already lined up his next project, helming the sci-fi thriller “Life on Mars.”"

POLITICS,"Talk show host Seth Meyers on Monday posted a sardonic response to President Donald Trump’s attack on this year’s White House Correspondents’ Association dinner that included a mention of Meyers’ 2011 performance at the gathering — which some say helped stir Trump’s presidential ambitions. In a tweet on Sunday, Trump criticized the controversial comic routine by the entertainer at Saturday’s dinner, Michelle Wolf, and called it even worse than Meyers’ “weak performance.” Meyers cheekily responded by commemorating the “anniversary.” You remembered!!!  Happy Anniversary, Boo https://t.co/CywS8bxz8b At the annual dinner seven years ago, Meyers, then the head writer and Weekend Update anchor on “Saturday Night Live,” cracked a string of jokes aimed at Trump. TV cameras repeatedly cut to a stone-faced Trump, who was among the crowd at the event. “The Apprentice” host had spent much of that year promulgating the birther conspiracy theory, raising doubts without evidence about whether then-President Barack Obama had been born in the U.S. Trump was among those demanding that Obama produce a copy of his birth certificate. Meyers pilloried Trump, lobbing jab after jab. Donald Trump has been saying he will run for president as a Republican, which is surprising, since I just assumed he was running as a joke. Donald Trump owns the Miss USA pageant, which is great for Republicans because it will streamline their search for a vice president. Donald Trump often appears on Fox, which is ironic because a fox often appears on Donald Trump’s head. Donald Trump said recently he has ‘a great relationship with the blacks,’ but unless ‘the Blacks’ are a family of white people, I bet he is mistaken. That evening, Obama himself also roasted Trump, joking about the birther conspiracy by playing his “birth video” ― a clip from Disney’s “The Lion King.” Like Meyers, he also mocked Trump. Just recently, in an episode of “Celebrity Apprentice,” at the steakhouse, the men’s cooking team did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks. And there was a lot of blame to go around. But you, Mr. Trump, recognized that the real problem was a lack of leadership. And so, ultimately, you didn’t blame Lil’ Jon or Meatloaf. You fired Gary Busey. And these are the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night. During Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, some of his allies conjectured that the 2011 dinner instilled a sense of bitterness and fury that propelled him to seriously mount his presidential bid, after many years of teasing the idea of a run. As Omarosa Manigault Newman, former “Apprentice” contestant and later (briefly) a White House official in Trump’s administration, told PBS’ “Frontline” in 2016: It just kept going and going, and he just kept hammering him. And I thought, “Oh, Barack Obama is starting something that I don’t know if he’ll be able to finish.” Trump adviser and confidant Roger Stone said: “I think that is the night that he resolves to run for president. I think that he is kind of motivated by it. ‘Maybe I’ll just run. Maybe I’ll show them all.’” Before Trump’s political rise, Meyers’ appearance was perhaps most remembered for a joke about Osama bin Laden hiding in plain sight by hosting a show on C-SPAN. Little did the public know that Obama had just authorized a military raid targeting bin Laden. The next evening, he announced in a nationally televised address that Navy Seals had killed the terrorist leader in Pakistan. Meyers himself has reflected on that infamous dinner and the role that he may have played in getting Trump to the White House. “I made fun of him in 2011. That’s the night he decided to run. I kicked the hornet’s nest,” he joked on fellow late night host Jimmy Fallon’s show last year. “It’s not the outcome I wanted, but that’s history. I got a man elected president. I want my points.” For the most part, Meyers, who has made sharp analysis of Trump a central part of his “Late Night” show has said that he does not regret the gibes he directed at the future president that night. “I want to make it very clear, I still very much enjoyed that evening and I do recollect it very fondly,” he told CNN last year. “It’s weird that people have made that case that [the jokes targeting Trump] spurred him to run, but I’ve always made it clear that I would be more angry had I said less about him as opposed to having any regrets about anything I said, joke-wise.” Earlier this year, as host of the Golden Globe Awards, Meyers attempted to make amends, of sorts. “In 2011, I told some jokes about our current president at the White House Correspondents’ dinner, jokes about how he was unqualified to be president. Some have said that night convinced him to run,” Meyers said in his opening monologue. “So if that’s true, I just want to say: Oprah, you will never be president! You do not have what it takes! And [Tom] Hanks, where’s Hanks? You will never be vice president.” “Now we just wait and see,” Meyers quipped. Trump has dismissed the theory that the dinner played a role in his presidential run, claiming that he enjoyed the evening — despite the cameras capturing his overt displeasure. “It’s such a false narrative. I had a phenomenal time. I had a great evening,” he told The Washington Post in 2016. He added that he felt “honored” by Obama’s jokes and that the then-president “delivered them well.” But of Meyers, Trump said: “I didn’t like his routine. His was too nasty, out of order.” "
POLITICS,"Rudy Giuliani warned special counsel Robert Mueller to steer clear of Ivanka Trump, daughter of and adviser to President Donald Trump, but said her husband, White House adviser Jared Kushner, is “disposable.” “If they do do Ivanka, which I doubt they will, the whole country will turn on him,” Giuliani told Sean Hannity on Wednesday night. “They’re going after his daughter?”  Hannity then asked the former New York City mayor about Kushner. “Jared is a fine man, you know that,” Giuliani said, “But men are, you know, disposable. But a fine woman like Ivanka? Come on.” The remark didn’t get much attention at first, given that Giuliani made headlines with several other comments.  He admitted that Trump repaid $130,000 to his personal attorney Michael Cohen that had been sent to porn star Stormy Daniels as part of a nondisclosure agreement just before the 2016 election.  He also admitted that Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey in part because he refused to say the president wasn’t under investigation.  The comments about Kushner have some wondering if Giuliani was sending a message. Former federal prosecutor Paul Butler said on MSNBC that one reading of Giuliani’s comments “might be he’s offering Jared Kushner’s head up on a platter to Mueller as long as he leaves the president’s daughter alone.”  Earlier this year, The New York Times reported that Trump was trying to find a way to get his daughter and son-in-law out of the White House and had asked his chief of staff, John Kelly, for help in ousting the couple. "

In fact, Reid began his first term in 1983 and finished his final term in 2017."
ARTS & CULTURE,"In the past decade or so, a subgenre of dystopian fiction has emerged to confront our changing planet: climate fiction, or “cli-fi.” In stories like Jeff VanderMeer’s “Southern Reach” trilogy, or Kim Stanley Robinson’s New York 2140 and Claire Vaye Watkins’ Gold Fame Citrus, characters confront floods, droughts and other environmental catastrophes. But, as a recent post on the Smithsonian blog points out, these stories are swiftly becoming not just future possibilities, but present realities. In an interview with HuffPost, VanderMeer noted that, “the solutions a fiction writer can provide, the speculation, is perhaps edging toward offensive in a policy context ― because we have scientists telling us what we need to do and they are the experts.” A new cartoon anthology called Warmer ― which is currently seeking funding on Kickstarter ― addresses these issues and more. Co-edited by artists Madeleine Witt and Andrew White, the collection of works serves to provide support and hope to those who are mourning the damage done to the earth. In an interview with HuffPost, White said, “As co-editors of Warmer, Madeleine and I wanted to make a book to offer comfort for those already fearful about climate change. So for the most part, Warmer doesn’t aim to convince anyone of anything. We imagined Warmer in part as a book that will function to encourage and support activists; to comfort those who, like ourselves, are wrestling with the grief of climate change.” Below is a selection from five of the book’s contributors. “This piece about humpback whale migration is the beginning of a collaborative project between me and my dear friend Catalina Jaramillo, a journalist who writes environmental/sustainability stories,” Berg said. “Through this collaboration I hope to express our shared love and respect for the ocean and its inhabitants.” “There’s beauty in just surviving despite everything, and real shame in so selfishly leaving all this to our children and grandchildren. And it won’t be far off in the distance — it’s already happening,” Skaalrud said. “I both feel helpless for my very young friends who will navigate climate change as it worsens, and still want to practically prepare them as much as I can. As I always say, ‘I can at least teach you to ride a horse, shoot a rifle, and start a fire.’” She says that as an artist, she “can’t present a perfect argument or deeply considered treatise that would change anyone’s mind. I feel, if there’s anything I can do that will truly activate change, it’s touching people’s hearts.” “Often in my work I engage with disability subjects, but when it comes to an issue as overwhelming as climate change, I think everyone of every ability is confronted with how limited they are,” Anderson said. “It’s always such a powerless feeling, such a moment of frustrated desire for control over your situation. We are ultimately still responsible for our part in this, even if we can barely do anything to fix it all. It’s a contradiction that can’t be resolved, a feeling of smallness in a moment where we need to be big.” They continued, “Art has the power to expand our emotional understanding of the political, and this is an important form of activism. It’s a responsibility artists need to rise to.” “For me, art and activism are two occasionally overlapping streams that come from the same source,” Witt said. “They both come out of a desire to see true things expressed, broken things healed, justice enacted. This comic, in particular, is a kind of meditative experience; the moment of quiet prayer before entering the battle, a necessary attempt to grasp the enormity of climate change and my own feeling about it. This comic is a piece of the reflection that necessarily precedes action.” “My piece for Warmer adapts several Yoko Ono instructions from her books Grapefruit and Acorn. For example, one piece that I adapted reads, ‘Walk in the footsteps of the person in front. 1. on ground 2. in mud 3. in snow 4. on ice 5. in water. Try not to make sounds,’” White said. “I found these pieces very moving. I couldn’t stop thinking about them. The instructions call upon the reader to go out into the world. Ono asks us to see the world as it is — to experience its beauty, its fragility, its splendor. So I aimed in my piece to both instill in readers that desire to reach out towards the world, and to communicate my own feelings about interacting with natural beauty when I fear that beauty might be fleeting.”"
ENTERTAINMENT,"The next chapter of Bridget, Carmen, Lena and Tibby’s story may be arriving sooner than we think. Actress Alexis Bledel revealed that the “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” cast has pitched a third movie and that she would “love” if it came to fruition. “The Handmaid’s Tale” star appeared on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” on Thursday and told the host that she “hopes it comes together.” “We don’t get to see each other a lot because everybody’s work or family and everything, but when everybody is in town we do, and we just pitched a third movie and I hope it comes together. It would be so great,” the actress said. The 36-year-old starred in the “Sisterhood” films in 2005 and 2008 with America Ferrera, Blake Lively and Amber Tamblyn. The women have reunited a few times over the years, either in pairs or otherwise, blowing up social media in the process:  A post shared by Blake Lively (@blakelively) on Aug 17, 2017 at 7:30pm PDT A post shared by America Ferrera (@americaferrera) on Jan 2, 2018 at 2:31pm PST A post shared by Amber Tamblyn (@amberrosetamblyn) on Jan 21, 2017 at 1:42pm PST A post shared by Blake Lively (@blakelively) on Jul 8, 2016 at 6:10pm PDT A post shared by America Ferrera (@americaferrera) on Aug 13, 2017 at 6:54pm PDT “The Sisterhood” films are based on the novel series of the same name by Ann Brashares. The series follows four best friends who share a pair of jeans that mysteriously fits each of them perfectly, as they go through life with various adventures (and misadventures). Of course, Bledel isn’t the only one of the original foursome that wants a third film to happen. ET Online spoke with Blake Lively on Thursday as well, and she said she thinks a third movie “could really happen.”  “I think that people who love the movie want to see it. So, I mean, fans have gotten bigger movies made,” she said. “Deadpool is all thanks to the fans. So I’m saying we’ll do it.” Back in 2017, both Ferrera and Tamblyn said they’d want a third film to come to life too. “It’s an idea and a conversation,” said Ferrera in March to E! News. “I think it would be amazing. The sisterhood is still well and alive. I love my girls. We’re very much a part of each other’s lives and, if the movie happens, it would be a great thing.” Tamblyn expressed in September that she had “very high hopes for it happening sooner rather than later.”  Let’s hope these ladies are right. We’ll be waiting with bated breath."

It's going to weave its way into every piece of art you create until all of your words and all of your brush strokes and all of your melodies seem to palpitate with the same rhythm of your lover's humble heart. It is going to control the diction, the beat, the speed of your normally harsh and brutal style and turn it into something soft and gentle and passionate. Let it. Learn from it. It's one of the best moments of being an artist. Passion atop passion. What more could you ask for?  4. Confidence is key. And believe it or not, but you're your own worst enemy. If you spend your days and nights dissecting and analyzing each component of your art--or your life and self for that matter-- you'll live in a never-ending cycle of misery and ""not being enough"". Embrace it and make it anew. You are more than another inhalation of oxygen. More than another heartbeat. More than another body. You are a person and a vibrant soul and you do matter. You do have an impact. You do make a difference. You count. Your life is literally in your hands. Do something with it.  5. Encourage others to explore their art. Whether they are three, thirteen, or thirty, everyone needs a little push sometimes. Who knows, you could be the difference between someone saying: ""I could have"" and, ""I did"". 6. Don't waste your time on things that don't interest you. Books, movies, fruits, whatever. If it bores you, move on to something else. Life's too short to sit and complain all day about something you don't enjoy. Find something you're passionate about and worth your while. 7. No one is going to do anything for you. If you want something done you have to go out and do it yourself. Push yourself. Motivate yourself to become more.  8. Regret is a waste of your time. You will spend late nights and early mornings and all the time in-between thinking of what you could have, should have, or would have done: but you didn't. And that's okay. Keep moving forward. Don't get caught in the past, it's not going anywhere.

9. My best friend told me: I think in the end we all become who we're meant to be anyway. I told her she was right. Don't be afraid if you veer away from who you think you are, who you really are will always prevail and shine true, you just have to be brave enough to embrace that.   10. If there's any one thing you remember from everything here, remember this: You are yourself, a work of art. But you are more precious than wistfully arranged words or carefully executed brushstrokes. You are more beautiful than even the perfect pliè. Or just the right intonation. Love yourself. Self-love is pure love, as all love should be. But if you go through life devoting all of your time and energy towards only loving and appraising others, what have you left for yourself? In the end, there must be a balance. After all, you can't run away from your own entity. Why not embrace it? Learning and truly loving yourself is one of the best decisions you can ever make. Trust me."
ENTERTAINMENT,"In a Tuesday morning appearance on “Megyn Kelly Today,” two women who dated R. Kelly shared disturbing details about how he allegedly abused and controlled them. Asante McGee and Kitti Jones, who went public with their abuse accusations last summer, told host Megyn Kelly they both lived with the singer at different points over the past several years in Atlanta and Chicago. “I had to wear sweatpants. I had to stand up when he would walk into a room,” said Jones, who says she began dating the R&B star in 2011. Both women allege the singer controlled many aspects of their lives, including what they ate, when they used the bathroom, and who they spoke to on their phones, which he allegedly monitored by adding them to his personal phone plan. “You would have to send a text message to one of his runners, just asking if you could go to the restroom, and they would relay the information to him,” Jones said. “You weren’t free to walk throughout the house.” “We were required to call him ‘Daddy.’ You would address him as ‘Daddy,’” said McGee, who dated Kelly between 2014 and 2016. Both women said that not using the nickname would lead to punishment, like being slapped.  A BuzzFeed report published last July renewed questions about the singer’s behavior. “Parents of women and girls still living in his house accused him of “brainwashing” their children in a “cult.” Several others subsequently came forward with similar stories of abuse. Kelly’s representatives have dismissed the claims as a “conspiracy.” One woman living with Kelly, Joycelen Savage, has denied the claims against him, but Jones and McGee agreed that Savage has indeed been “brainwashed.” Jones also said she believes the singer was guilty of the child pornography charges he was ultimately acquitted of a decade ago.

ARTS & CULTURE," Perhaps the most recognizable poster created by Paul Rand is the one he made for IBM, with its clean iconic triad, the eye, the bee, with the alphabet letter M, striped to match the body of the bee, to complete the rhebus. The graphic designer Paul Rand (1914-1996) is acknowledged as the artist who lifted graphic design to a new level of Art. Known not only for his corporate work, identity programs, packaging design, brochures, Paul Rand, born Peretz Rosenbaum in Brooklyn, was a teacher, in the lecture halls at Yale, and as a writer of numerous volumes including Thoughts on Design and Design, Form, and Chaos. Writing constantly, he wrote not only to educate, but to clarify his thoughts and assertions. At the Museum of the City of New York, the breadth and scope of his career is in full display. A bit too crowded to give each work its full measure of weight, the exhibition, ads hung chockablock on the walls and laid out in vitrines in a first floor gallery, is a testament to his legacy. His definition of quality written for his colleagues at IBM defies styles and trends: ""The concept of Quality is difficult to define, for it is not merely seen, but somehow intuited in the presence of the work in which it is embodied. Quality has little to do with popular notions of beauty, taste, or style; and nothing to do with status, respectability, or luxury. It is revealed, rather, in an atmosphere of receptivity, proprietary, and restraint."" At the exhibition's opening, designers Steven Heller, Bob Salpeter and Bob Gill were among those paying homage to this master in their field. A version of this post also appears on Gossip Central."
ENTERTAINMENT,"For a limited time next time, comedy titans Jon Stewart and Dave Chappelle will take the stage together. They will perform a total of seven dates, starting June 11, 12, and 13 in Boston. They’ll move onto Houston for June 21 and 22 performances and finish in El Paso on June 23 and 24. The two previously took the stage together last August when Stewart made a surprise appearance at Chappelle’s Radio City Music Hall standup show. It was shortly after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, when white supremacists showed up with Tiki torches and President Donald Trump claimed there were “very fine people on both sides.” “Music and words and art is a power that can extinguish a Tiki torch,” Stewart said during that show. If comedians discussing the social and political landscape is your thing, then the combination of Chappelle and Stewart is a must-see."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Desperate for a new anti-totalitarian dystopia to channel your Trump-era anxieties? Philip Pullman has you covered. Pullman, the acclaimed British author of the fantasy series “His Dark Materials,” recently announced that he will be publishing The Book of Dust, the first installment in a planned trilogy, in October. The book will feature Lyra Belacqua, the protagonist of “His Dark Materials,” though the events of The Book of Dust will take place when Lyra is still an infant. He has described the book as revolving around “the struggle between a despotic and totalitarian organization, which wants to stifle speculation and inquiry, and those who believe thought and speech should be free.” The apparent parallels between contemporary political concerns and the events of The Book of Dust are not mere coincidence, according to Pullman. “I might not be writing about Donald Trump or Brexit or Nigel Farage directly in ‘The Book of Dust,’” he stated in an interview with the Associated Press. Nonetheless, he said, the “questions they pose and the situations they set up are very much part of the world that I’m writing about.” Readers familiar with Pullman’s wildly popular “His Dark Materials” trilogy won’t be surprised by his inclusion of provocative, politically charged themes. The Golden Compass (published as The Northern Lights in the U.K.), The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass saw young, street-smart Lyra drawn into a massive conspiracy engineered by a corrupt and repressive religious order, the Magisterium, that strongly resembles the Catholic Church. Lyra, who lives in a parallel universe where each human’s soul is housed in an external daemon companion and where witches are real, crossed paths with Will Parry, who stumbled over from our dimension in pursuit of his lost father.  The series blends earnest fascination with physics, metaphysics and spirituality with a critique of organized religion. (Pullman, who has openly stated that he wishes the “wretched” Catholic Church “will vanish entirely,” has identified himself as an atheist.) Despite occasional controversy surrounding the book’s anti-organized religion bent, the series has sold 18 million books worldwide and spawned a 2007 film starring Nicole Kidman as malevolent Magisterium authority Mrs. Coulter. The new series, which Pullman describes not as a prequel or sequel but an “equel” to “His Dark Materials,” will focus on inquiries into the nature of “Dust,” a mysteriously powerful substance much feared by religious leaders in the original series.  As copies of George Orwell’s 1984 sell out on Amazon and Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale hover at the top of the site’s best-seller list, there’s no denying that our collective appetite for tales of dystopian worlds ruled by theocratic and totalitarian oppression is at a peak. In an era when terms like “fake news” are being bandied about to discredit objective journalism and science, there’s no one better than Pullman to infuse our stacks of anti-authoritarian reading with a fresh saga about free speech and inquiry. The only downside? American and British reader have to wait until Oct. 19 to read the first book. We’ll be counting the days."
POLITICS,"President Donald Trump expressed “sadness and heartbreak” over the deadly shooting at a high school in Texas on Friday morning.  He spoke for around 90 seconds ahead of planned remarks on prison reform during a summit at the White House. “This has been going on too long in our country. Too many years, too many decades now,” the president said of school shootings. He called the Texas incident “absolutely horrific.” The attack at Santa Fe High School left at least eight dead, according to local news outlets citing law enforcement. Santa Fe, Texas, is around 35 miles southeast of Houston. “To the students, families, teachers and personnel at Santa Fe High, we’re with you in this tragic hour and we’ll be with you forever,” Trump said. “My administration is determined to do everything in our power to protect our students, secure our schools, and to keep weapons out of the hands of those who pose a threat to themselves and to others.” “Everyone must work together at every level of government to keep our children safe,” the president continued. “May God heal the injured and may God comfort the wounded, and may God be with the victims and with the victims’ families.” “Very sad day,” the president added. “Very, very sad.” “On another note, a very positive note, I’m honored to be here today with so many leaders across the nation who are committed to the crucial issue of prison reform,” Trump said in an awkward pivot to his planned remarks. A shooter has been arrested and another person of interest has been detained, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez announced. A fire alarm prompted students to flee the school, and the situation had been “contained” by late Friday morning, officials said. The total number of injured is not yet known. The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston is accepting patients from the school. Trump reportedly spoke with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) and pledged to “provide all appropriate federal assistance.” The incident in Santa Fe marks the 22nd U.S. school shooting of 2018, by CNN’s count. Trump ― who spoke at the National Rifle Association’s annual convention earlier this month alongside Vice President Mike Pence ― has been sharply criticized for seemingly siding with the gun lobby against those pushing for gun policy reform in the wake of the February massacre in Parkland, Florida. No major gun reform legislation has been passed during Trump’s administration. In the weeks after the Valentine’s Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which left 17 dead, the president proposed a plan that would arm some school personnel in an effort to make educational facilities safer. Many in education and law enforcement argued that the president’s plan would have the opposite effect. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"
Tomi Ungerer: All in One, curated by Claire Gilman at The Drawing Center, NYC. It is amazing to witness works of art that profoundly change the direction you're moving through life with. A few days removed from experiencing Tomi Ungerer: All in One at The Drawing Center in SOHO, I am still remarkably elevated. The show not only took you through the life of the artist, but through the soul of the world from 1940 to the present.
Image courtesy of Tomi Ungerer Collection, Ireland Starting off with his schoolboy sketchbooks (which were composed in Nazi occupied Alsace), to originals of his children's book designs, to protest posters, to classic illustrations for the Village Voice and New York Times, and finally his bondage work that set his world spinning, the exhibition was delicately curated by the knowing hands of Claire Gilman. The viewer is able to witness the process of Ungerer getting an idea that was swimming around in his mind to spill out perfectly. In an era where we are too quick to search for a stock image on Getty to convey a certain mood, Ungerer's work stands as a beacon for telling people to walk over slowly to this side of the world and take a look at what's happening.
Image courtesy of Tomi Ungerer Collection, Ireland The times Ungerer lived through are stained forever on the canvases that he impressed himself upon. As you walk through the show, there are little cards next to each item depicting not only what's happening in front of you, but when and where in history it took place. All too often, exhibitions attempt to show you how much they know, forcing their interpretations on you. At this show however, it's as if there are personal valets standing before each piece preparing the perfect lens to look through. While there were instances where one could reflect on the history Ungerer moved through, at other times, you could see your naked self reflected back in the work. There is an almost healing potion that absolves you of your pain by experiencing the Ungerer's placement of it.
Image courtesy of Tomi Ungerer Collection, Ireland If you really want to treat yourself, I suggest watching Far Out Isn't Far Enough: The Tomi Ungerer Story on Netflix before you go. It will add another layer to the experience. The show only runs through March 22nd, so while New York goes through its initial winter thaw, there is no better way to start a new season than to take in an artist who refused to be pushed down by definitions, countries or industries."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Christina Aguilera has no intentions of slowing down anytime soon.  The singer is gearing up for her upcoming eighth studio album “Liberation” (out June 15) ― her first in six years ― by dropping lead single “Accelerate” and an accompanying glitter-soaked video on Thursday. The track, featuring Ty Dolla $ign and 2 Chainz, is a stripped-down reinvention of a classic Aguilera sound. Produced by none other than Kanye West, the single is more hip-hop-inspired than her previous record, 2012′s “Lotus,” with a drumbeat primed for summer, but still features some iconic Xtina vocal accents. “Accelerate, c’mon babe / pick up your speed,” she sings on the sultry song’s chorus. “Stamina, fill me up / that’s what I need.” In the music video, Aguilera is bathed in a honey-like substance as she serves the camera face in alternating black-and-white and technicolor setups. Her aesthetic is consistent with the fresh-faced makeover she showed off on the cover of Paper Magazine earlier this year, stripping away the heavy makeup for a more effortless look.  #LIBERATION JUNE 15Pre-order: https://t.co/C0ukmLoyM4✖️✖️✖️✖️✖️✖️ pic.twitter.com/EN9qypuDxV Aguilera has been teasing her new era for years ― fans have even made compilation videos of her dodging questions in interviews ― as she’s put music on the back-burner to appear as a judge on the “The Voice” and other projects.  “I was longing for freedom,” she told Billboard about shooting the reality competition series. “I would just take everything off ― the makeup, all of it ― and would blast hip-hop, or Nirvana, ‘Creep,’ Slayer. Anything like that to get me out of that zone, that TV mode.” During her “time off,” however, she still managed to release some new music, including the disco song “Telepathy” from Netflix’s “The Get Down” and a feature on Pitbull’s “Feel This Moment.” That drive to break free of expectations, self-imposed and otherwise, seems to be the impetus for the new album. “My existence has no expiration. This is my liberation. This is our liberation. Be liberated with me,” Aguilera said in a clip during a show in Baku, Azerbaijan, over the weekend. “It’s time for a liberation … as one: a liberated nation.” IT'S TIME FOR A #LIBERATION!!! pic.twitter.com/XcnOP0tg3E Starting out in the industry when she was just 10 years old, Aguilera had long been beholden to the tastes of executives, manufactured competition with other pop stars and album sales ― her last album was also her worst-selling ― but now she’s taking matters into her own hands.  “I felt super label-driven and confined [being] commercially successful,” she told the outlet. “And as great as it looks on the outside, I’m such a truth girl that if I’m not happy with something, I just can’t do it anymore.” Take a look at the full “Liberation” track list below, which unfortunately does not include the singer’s long-promised duet with Pink. Instead, we have collaborations with artists like Demi Lovato (!) and Keida & Shenseea."
BUSINESS,"In the wake of the Parkland school shooting that left 17 people dead, Bumble announced it will no longer allow members to post any photos of guns or other weapons. The popular app, which was created as a “female-first” dating service, will search through all of its members’ profiles and remove images with weapons. The company plans to filter out any mention or discussion of guns in written content as well, Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd told The New York Times. The new policy won’t apply to people working in law enforcement or in the military. Herd said that some gun owners, such as competitive sports shooters, could appeal to the company to keep their gun photos on the site.  In a blog post published on Monday, Bumble wrote:    Bumble was founded with safety in mind. From the start, our mission has been to build a social network rooted in respect and kindness.Online behavior can both mirror and predict how people treat each other in the real world.

ARTS & CULTURE,"“My idea from the beginning was I wanted it to be like a moving Vanity Fair cover,” said Shoshana Bean, describing the video she and fellow Broadway superstar Cynthia Erivo filmed for their cover of Taylor Swift’s “I Did Something Bad.”  “I’m obsessed with Downton Abby,” the singer told Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl. “So if Downton Abby made a music video, this is kind of what it would be; it would just be very still and regal.” Pairing Broadway stars and two instrumentalists, all clad in black and scarcely moving a muscle for four minutes, doesn’t exactly sound like a recipe for success. Fortunately for Bean and Erivo – not to mention listeners accounting for nearly 650,000 YouTube views to date ― it has been. “People’s reaction is beyond anything I could ever... both Cynthia and I are like, ‘What is happening?!’” confessed Bean on Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ Podcast. “We thought it was cool but not this cool!” Fans of The Great White Way are likely familiar with both women. In 2005, Bean stepped into Idina Menzel’s shoes playing Elphaba in the Broadway production of Wicked, reprising the role a year later for the company’s first national tour. Erivo won “Best Actress in a Musical” at the 2016 Tony Award as Celie in The Color Purple. Backed only by Kiara Perico on viola and cellist April Guthrie, their voices meld beautifully for the smoldering take on an album track from current Swift opus Revenge. Ryan Parma’s video captivates, calling to mind the nonplussed female guitarists in the iconic music video for Robert Palmer’s ’80s hit “Addicted to Love.” Cooed Bean: “Yes, you got it!” Whether for its visuals or the powerhouse vocals – likely a combination of the two – “I Did Something Bad” has become a viral sensation. Media outlets from Billboard Magazine to Entertainment Tonight, Elle to Broadway staple Playbill have heaped praise on the rendering. Even Swift herself took notice, sharing the link to her nearly 86 million Twitter followers. Bean called the experience “crazy,” especially given the “Look What You Made Me Do” star’s recent step away from social media for the release of the new album. “My friend, in the morning, was like, ‘What if Taylor sees it?’” she shared a conversation from Dec. 1, when the video went live. “I was like, ‘She’s never going to see it.’ Then I woke up from a nap four hours later to a retweet!” Despite several friends close to the mega-star — like choreographer, fellow Broadway star and RuPaul’s Drag Race judge Todrick Hall — how Swift discovered their version is still a mystery, Bean says. The tweet, though, eased some concern. She shared: “You never know if you’re going to offend someone.” WATCH: Shoshana Bean & Cynthia Erivo Slay “I love seeing my songs covered by other people, how they reimagine and reinvent,” stated Bean,  “So I would always hope it would have the same affect on [Taylor], that she would enjoy it, respect it, be flattered. I don’t know. I just love the song.” In fact, one article cites Bean saying “I Did Something Bad” was “love at first listen.” The singer used the podcast as an opportunity to “slightly retract” the earlier statement. “Nothing of Taylor’s is ever ‘love at first listen’ for me,” confessed Bean, a guest performer last summer at TrevorLIVE New York 2017, a signature fundraising event supporting the Trevor Project’s LGBTQ-focused suicide prevention resources and crisis intervention services.  “Taylor is like an earworm,” she continued. “I always go through and am like, ‘Nah, I’m not into it!’ Then something will bring me back to it.” In this instance, Bean was in Hawaii, preparing to hit the treadmill. Knowing “if for nothing else, it’s going to give me a great beat,” she turned on Revenge. “All of a sudden,” the singer recalled, “I was like, ‘Holy shit! This is a great album!’” Her ears really perked up, Bean said, when Swift sang, “You’ve got to leave before you get left.” Before her workout finished, the track was on repeat with the genesis for her cover forming.  According to the singer, whose next solo album Spectrum is set for release February 2018, she never considered of her rendition a “huge reimagining” of the original. Though hailed as such by many, Bean simply honed in on the lyrical mention of “violins” and peeled back layers of production and “sonic elements” Swift is dabbling in on the new record. “Sometimes that can overshadow what’s just a good song on its own,” said Bean, pointing to the success of her cover as proof the track “can stand on its own with just a couple violins or just a piano or just a guitar.” That, she says, “is the magic of Taylor Swift in the first place.  “She’s a great songwriter. No one can dispute that,” she concluded, “When you strip away all the bells and whistles, that’s what’s there — and I think that’s all we really did, just strip away the bells and whistles.” Visit Shoshana Bean’s Website.

POLITICS,"Vice President Mike Pence appeared at an event in Tempe, Arizona, on Tuesday, where he stood alongside and doled out accolades to former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who has been convicted of illegally targeting Latinos.  “A great friend of this president, a tireless champion of strong borders and the rule of law,” Pence said during a speech about tax cuts. “Sheriff Joe Arpaio, I’m honored to have you here.” Arpaio, who is running for Senate in Arizona, engaged in unlawful policing and racial profiling during his time as sheriff, a 2011 report by the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division determined. His officers stopped Latino drivers four to nine times more frequently than they stopped others, and Arpaio became known for using derogatory terms such as “Mexican bitches.” He also oversaw a series of bizarre and draconian tactics in his county’s prison system, including forcing some people to parade around in pink underwear and reportedly calling his state’s jail a “concentration camp.” His office also ignored hundreds of sex abuse cases, according to an Associated Press investigation.  “Mike Pence’s all-but-endorsement of Joe Arpaio proves that there is no end in sight for the divisive and increasingly nasty fight for the GOP nomination,” Arizona Democratic Party spokesman Drew Anderson said in a statement. “Arizonans want leaders who will get things done, not just partisan politicians who will add to the chaos in Washington.” Arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt last year for violating a 2011 order that barred him and his staff from detaining people based on their suspected immigration status.  “If you’re going to come across that border, you should be arrested and get the consequences of it,” Arpaio told the Washington Examiner upon announcing his Senate run. President Donald Trump pardoned Arpaio in August, saying ― much like Pence did ― that Arpaio is tough on immigration. Many were quick to point out Arpaio’s abysmal record on law enforcement following Pence’s remarks: Mike Pence is “honored” to have Joe Arpaio at his event? And he calls a bigoted criminal who tortured inmates a “strong champion of the rule of law”? Even Arizona Republicans know this man undermines the most basic of American values. https://t.co/RwcQtKk86S This is embarrassing for Pence.Arpaio is reviled in Arizona’s law enforcement community because he did *not* champion the rule of law. https://t.co/Tq4yI0jhE7 Arpaio directly flouted the rule of law on immigration https://t.co/50t4SBo0gw The Department of Justice concluded that Joe Arpaio oversaw the worst pattern of racial profiling in U.S. history. He’s been accused of police misconduct, abuse of power, failure to investigate sex crimes, and unlawful enforcement of immigration laws. Nicely done @VP. https://t.co/p3rkfMpyVk This story has been updated with a statement from the Arizona Democratic Party."
BUSINESS,"Wall Street looked at the news coming out of Washington, D.C., and pushed the panic button Wednesday. In the first day of trading after The New York Times reported that President Donald Trump had told former FBI Director James Comey to stop an investigation into disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn, stocks slid the most since Election Day. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index closed down 1.8 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index that tracks a smaller group of companies, dropped 371 points or 1.77 percent. Bank stocks, which have surged since Trump’s election, were down 3.5 percent. The prices of bonds and gold went up, as usually happens when other assets are volatile. Before Wednesday’s slide, stocks were up 15 percent since Election Day, despite ho-hum jobs reports and growth numbers. Investors seemed to be betting that everything that could be good for stocks ― slashed tax rates for capital income and the wealthy; a huge infrastructure spending bill; bank regulations being gutted; a one-time tax holiday on overseas cash that companies could plow into huge dividends and share buybacks ― would happen. But an infrastructure spending bill and a massive tax reform package always seemed like long shots, and only look even more unlikely given the current turmoil in Washington. The other assumption investors seemed to be making was that things that are bad for stocks ― restrictive immigration policies; trade wars; a foreign policy crisis; a constitutional crisis ― wouldn’t happen. But the chances of the last scenario becoming a reality rose dramatically Tuesday night with the report that Trump appeared to try to obstruct the FBI’s investigation into Flynn by telling Comey to drop the investigation before eventually firing him. As stocks fell Wednesday afternoon, Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal tweeted: “Investors lose faith in Trump agenda after stocks go down.” That may sound like a joke, and it is funny, but Weisenthal was serious and he makes a perceptive point about the basis of the Trump Rally: On Wall Street, the question of whether something is “good” or “bad” hinges entirely on how it affects stocks."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Born in New Zealand and now living in Australia, painter and interior designer, Sue Paterson, has made her way to America, with her bright, naturalistic new art series in tow. Although Paterson is an avid traveler, taking inspiration from flora, fauna and architecture from wherever she visits, this is her premiere U.S. exhibition.  Her collection, Bursting Into Life hones in on her meditative process, genuine attachment to nature and skills as a maestro of interiors.  In pieces like Tree of Life and Orientique, Paterson uses her vastly open and colorful imagination to depict her ever-evolving visions while staying true to the belief that art has the potential to elevate and exhilarate one's life. And that stays true for the viewers of her work as well.  ""Luckily I have never experienced 'artist's block',"" Paterson explains.  ""I find inspiration everywhere I go, by watching people, or seeing a new terrain, everything sparks my imagination. The challenge lies in depicting what I see, whether it is in front of me or in my mind. I've grown up appreciating my surroundings and the magic that is rain forests, oceans and colors. Use of color and light are very important to me when it comes to composition. I believe colors can have an emotional impact on a viewer. I painted my Spice of Life piece so I could begin a painting with that powerful saffron orange.""    No stranger to architecture and design, Paterson has a firm understanding of decor. She knows what looks good and where it looks best. As a visual artist and designer by trade, Bursting Into Life displays her visions of nature but the works also are designed not only to hang on walls.   Whereas her art can be showcased traditionally, it is also what she describes as ""functional art""  As one piece in her new series, Paterson took her painting titled Wild Natives and transformed it into fabric on a chair; an everyday piece of furniture made into a work of art. With a prominent following of buyers, Paterson is building on this particular collection of turning her paintings into furniture and home furnishings, such as upholstery and lampstands.

   On June 21 2016, Paterson will be showcasing her series, Bursting Into Life at the legendary Montalban Theatre in Hollywood. The theatre, which has hosted both noteworthy performances and classic films since the 20's, is holding the exhibition as its very first art show. Paterson is currently working on her own ""quirky"" depiction of the theatre itself, which she painted in the theatre's gallery. 10% of sale proceeds will be going to the Gabriella Foundation which teaches dance to underprivileged children.  You can learn more about Sue Paterson by visiting her website and you can RSVP to the event here.

POLITICS,"Officials in Knox County, Tennessee, are trying to gather more information about a cyberattack that crashed a government website that displayed election results to the public during its primary election for local offices on Tuesday.  Dick Moran, the county’s top IT official, believes Knox County was the target of a denial-of-service attack in which actors with both domestic and foreign IP addresses deliberately flooded the county’s servers with traffic to try and crash them. The county website displaying election results went down for about an hour as polls closed on Tuesday. The crash meant that people who went to check election results between 8 and 9 p.m. on election night received an error message, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel. While the website was down, election officials printed out hard copies of the election results and gave them to reporters, WBIR, a local NBC affiliate, reported. Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett (R) said on Wednesday that the crash didn’t impact “vote tallies or the integrity of the election,” but that the county had hired a security firm to investigate the cause of the crash. “This is not something that should happen,” he said in a statement. “I want to know what happened, and I think an independent review will help to determine that so we can move forward and work to prevent similar issues in the future.” The attack comes amid increased scrutiny over the security of U.S. elections after the Department of Homeland Security notified 21 states last year that Russian hackers targeted their election systems during the 2016 presidential election. Some say the federal government hasn’t moved quickly enough to address the severity of the threat. Responding to those concerns, Congress allocated $380 million to states in March to improve election security. DHS officials say they have improved communication and resource-sharing with state election officials. Scott McConnell, a DHS spokesman, said the agency was aware of the incident. “We are aware of reports of a temporary outage affecting an election website in Knox County, Tenn. We have no information at this time that the outage was caused by a malicious actor,” McConnell said in a statement. “As is standard practice with any of our public or private critical infrastructure partners, we have offered our technical assistance and support to the county. We defer to the county to discuss any further details.” Candice Hoke, a co-founder of the Center for Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection at Ohio’s Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, said it was premature for Burchett to say that no votes had been changed. “Without a forensic evaluation, there’s no way for them to accurately conclude that ‘the crash did not affect the vote tallies or the integrity of the election,’” she wrote in an email. “We do not know if only the web servers were impacted by the attack or if a broader impact occurred. It’s often the case that a DDOS attack is used as a distraction while another more insidious attack — such as on the tabulation servers — is occurring.” Hoke added that it was a positive sign that the county was bringing in a firm to analyze the incident, but wanted to know how thorough the analysis would be and whether the final report would be publicly available. She also said it was uncommon to see a denial of service attack on an election night, but expected them to increase this year because counties now store much more voter information online. In an interview, Michael Grider, the Knox County director of communications, and David Ball, the county’s deputy director of IT, disputed Hoke’s assessment that any votes could have been altered because the systems that tabulate the official votes are never connected to the internet or any computers that are. Ball said the county hadn’t looked at the actual voting data from election night because there was no way someone could access the data. “There’s no way that anyone could’ve gotten into it,” he said. “The issue that we had was one related to our web server. It was very simply an issue with how the election results were presented to the public, not how they were received in any official capacity,” Grider said. “There is no network connection to the official results, nor to any of the voting machines at any point during the process or before and after the process. They have no network interface,” Ball added. Hoke said that she knew of several examples where system owners believed their networks to be entirely disconnected from the internet when they actually had some connectivity and suggested that the Knox County officials could have been more cautious in their statements. “It’s wonderful to be able to espouse confidence as they are, but they should not be espousing such unless they have actually had their network for the [election management server] totally assessed by someone whose qualified in network architecture,” she said. The primary races on the ballot in Knox County on Tuesday included county mayor, sheriff and the county commission. The contest attracted some national attention after Glenn Jacobs, the former WWE wrestler known as Kane, won the Republican nomination for mayor. This story has been updated with comment from Grider and Ball, a response from Hoke and a statement from DHS."
ARTS & CULTURE," The above painting, captures the innocence of childhood and my love of Martha's Vineyard. I have traveled to the island every summer for the last 17 years. It's hard to write about its splendor without sounding cliche. Although there is much that is upscale on MV, there is also raw beauty woven throughout. All I can say is the President and his family vacation there for a reason. Illustrating a child worn out from play, slumbering on the beach, is my way of bottling the island's magic. Just looking at this picture, brings me right back to the warm sand and soothing sound of the sea. Beach Dreams was an illustration commission for a poem. I was given free reign on how I depicted it, so I drew from my own experience. Dreaming has always been such a big factor in my life. The little girl sleeping is my way of saying the more you relax into your dreams, the more you allow them to come to you. If given a chance, dreams take care of themselves.

ARTS & CULTURE,"For HuffPost’s #LoveTakesAction series, we’re telling stories of how people are standing up to hate and supporting those most threatened. What will you stand up for? Tell us with #LoveTakesAction. What constitutes political artwork? Well, it depends. For the majority of Americans ― namely those who aren’t straight, able-bodied, cis-gendered, white men ― simply depicting the banal realities of daily life has long been a political gesture. As Los Angeles–based artist Shing Yin Khor told The Huffington Post: “I do believe that the personal is political, and have always felt that writing about myself ― as a brown, immigrant woman ― is by default a political gesture because our voices are incredibly underrepresented in all creative fields.” Shing predominately works in sculpture and installation art, but a few years ago, she began publicly sharing her autobiographical comics. Her cartoons tackled subjects like heartbreak, masturbation, adventure travels and greatest fears ― many topics that aren’t often explored from the perspective of a woman of color.  “Even if I am just making work about my time spent in national parks,” Shing said, “I am pointing out that brown women also hike in national parks, which is a particular narrative that is usually centered on the experiences of white people.” However, since President Donald Trump took office, Shing, who is also bisexual, noticed her work changing tenor. “I can’t stop my work from arcing in a political direction,” she said, “when my actual identity as a human being is something the Trump administration wants to unconstitutionally deny basic rights to.”  For many Americans, life under Trump has not been business as usual. An executive order against people of one religion along with the dread of other restrictive orders that may come have led some people to question their daily habits and responsibilities, reevaluating whether their life choices are still valid, effective, enough. Shing, too, contemplated giving up her practice to go to train as an abortion provider or civil rights lawyer ― something that could have a more direct social impact. On the day of Trump’s inauguration, Shing planned to spend the day in bed. While scrolling through social media on her phone, she landed on a photo of a woman who became one of the day’s most celebrated heroes: an older Asian-American woman in a purple parka, her two middle fingers raised toward the heavens like a boss. “It was an impulse,” Shing said of the decision to paint the woman she affectionately dubbed #ResistanceAuntie. “The painting took 10 minutes, I quickly posted it on my social feeds, and ... It just kind of spread.” Shing’s painting quickly went viral, receiving over 2,000 likes on Twitter. She soon posted a link to a high-resolution image of the artwork, available for use under a free culture license. This too, was a protest in itself. “I am a strong proponent of Creative Commons licensing and release as much of my art as I can for free under a license that allows for non-commercial derivative works,” Shing said, adding, “I will continue to do whatever little I can to change the way that people interact with art [...] and invite everyone to adapt my art as they see fit.” That was Day One of Trump’s presidency, and Shing has far from slowed down. Following the president’s executive order banning refugees from Syria and temporarily blocking travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, the artist felt obligated ― like many around the country ― to take action. Except, as a working artist, she had limited funds to donate to organizations advocating for immigrants and refugees. Also, as Shing put it, “I am kind of an anxious and introverted potato and even thinking about going to the protests made me feel terribly anxious.” Nonetheless, she wanted to contribute in an impactful way. On Saturday evening, when many protestors swarmed airports around the country to protest Trump’s ban, Shing decided to set up a live-stream on her computer so others could watch her paint the Statue of Liberty, the symbol of promise and freedom that greeted countless immigrants as they approached American soil.  Shing planned to sell the resulting paintings for $50 each and donate all proceeds to the ACLU. She estimated she’d make about 10 over the course of five hours. The people, however, wanted more, and Shing pulled an all-nighter to deliver. She ended up painting 40 pictures of Lady Liberty over the course of 13 hours, raising $2,000 for the ACLU.  “The whole art marathon was an impulse I thought about on the way home and launched just an hour later,” Shing tweeted the following morning. “But it works, so let’s do it more.” Another tweet thanked her many supporters: “You’ve given me faith that making art instead of being at a protest is NOT useless civic action.” In the future, Shing hopes to participate in similarly challenging feats of endurance art, with proceeds benefitting those put at risk by Trump’s administration.  On Tuesday, she tweeted a drawing of Nora al-Awlaki, the 8-year-old American girl killed in a U.S. military raid conducted Sunday in southern Yemen, noting that she had resolved to wake up each morning and paint a child killed by Trump’s administration. “I hope I will not be doing this every morning,” she clarified in a later tweet. “I usually meditate, but it’s not quite working lately, so I might as well just stay angry.” The world prays that Shing will not have to start each morning with a portrait like Nora’s. Nonetheless, the artist is determined to push onward with her activist art practice. And she’s not alone. Every morning, I'm going to try and paint an American child killed by the Trump administration. pic.twitter.com/iTaTHDGjc6 “I am very much inspired by artist friends of mine who are continuing to do both their work and advocacy at the same time,” Shing said. She mentioned Mari Naomi, who maintains the Cartoonists of Color Database, who recently edited and curated a comic series called State of Emergency, featuring cartoonists’ responses to the Trump administration. There are plenty more. “My friend Steenz coordinated a zine series with many other artists called Take Comfort, Take Care, and hands them out at protests. My friend Shivana made this great image about starting activism, that is, bringing activism work to light in a very approachable and simple way. My friend Autumn will be teaching a zine workshop at her mosque in Canada,” she said. “There is so much good work happening every single day.” Still, Shing occasionally struggles with how best to participate in the effort to resist Trump’s policies. In times of uncertainty and anxiety, she often turns to an essay Toni Morrison wrote in 2004 following the re-election of former President George W. Bush, when the iconic author was overwhelmed by feelings of powerlessness and despair. A world without art, Morrison reminds her readers, and herself, is a world without imagination, empathy, critical thinking and dreams rooted in truth. As Shing put it: “We need artists. We will always need artists. In trying to prevent our worlds from imploding, we can’t forget to also continue make progress towards the world that we want to live in. For me, that is a universe full of equality and justice, but also beautiful art and good stories that explain the diverse and exciting human narratives that we all embody.” Follow Shing Yin Khor on Twitter or visit her website.

ARTS & CULTURE,"The preteens and teenagers in Richard Ford’s fiction are captivated ― if perplexed ― by their parents’ choices. A 15-year-old drifts around in search of his twin after his parents are arrested for robbing a bank. An even younger boy witnesses a domestic spat just before his mother flees from his life.  Like his protagonists, Ford is taken with the task of understanding his parents. His most recent book, Between Them, is not a fictional exploration of that particular family dynamic, but a pair of memoirs, one dedicated to his father, who died when Ford was 16, and one to his mother. “Hardly an hour goes by on any day that I do not think something about my father,” he writes of Parker Ford, a hardworking traveling salesman forced to stay still after a major heart attack. Of his mother, Edna Akin, he writes, “The act of considering my mother’s life is an act of love.”  Of the pair and his relationship with them: “Our parents intimately link us, closeted as we are in our own lives, to a thing we’re not, forging a joined separateness and a useful mystery, so that even together with them we are also alone.” This sort of matter-of-fact observation is what Ford has come to be known for, and accounts for his categorization as a writer of “dirty realism,” alongside Raymond Carver, Tobias Wolff and Cormac McCarthy. The style lends itself well to memoiristic writing, where analysis of one’s own life runs the risk of slipping into sentimentality. That’s not the case for Ford; by describing the details of his parents’ lives, and describing what he failed to ever learn about them, he gracefully pays them tribute.  Below, the author discusses the challenges of memoir-writing and his own Southern upbringing: Is this your story, your parent’s story, or something of both? Their story. It’s their story. It’s not my story at all. I mean, I get to tell it because I’m the only one who knows it. I’m the only person left alive who knew my parents. And so it’s inescapable if I want to testify to their experience that I be the person who tells it. I wasn’t obsessively trying to keep myself out of it, but I never imagined it as being my story, or that their importance as two people owed itself to me in any way.  How did the writing process differ for you, between writing fiction and writing these short memoirs? Well, it was sort of a sensate difference, in that it seems starker to write about my parents because it all depended on the factual rudiments of their lives. So it seemed a little grainier, whereas writing fiction for me, which I’ve done for most of my life, has kind of a plushness to it, as if underneath the surface there’s a volume. And with any kind of nonfiction writing that depends on facts entirely, there is not that plushness. Even when I was provisionally commenting on things that [my parents] did ― supposing this or supposing that ― it still seemed fastened to the mast of the book’s factual underpinning.  You’ve talked about writing and word choice as a mode of discovery ― the meaning of a sentence may change based on a desired tone or sound. How did this function for you when writing about true things rather than made-up ones?  That’s a good question, because you still do ― one still does ― write a sentence, and you come to a point at which you need a verb, or you need even an adjective. In a piece of fiction, you can choose a word without any investment in its content. Only an investment in its effect, or where it might lead the sentence. With a piece of nonfiction you still have a choice. But you have to say about the word and its use, “Is this accurate?” Accuracy is not a phenomenon in writing fiction in the same way that it is a phenomenon in writing memoir or writing nonfiction.  There are some kinds of accuracies in fiction that obtain. If you’re writing about Great Falls, Montana, you can’t say the Missouri River runs south there. There is that sort of geographical accuracy, but even that can be subject to all kinds of fantastical whims. But still, I think, that the Missouri River runs north there is kind of inescapable.  I remember one time I wrote a story for The New Yorker, and I put the address of the YWCA, and let’s say that I said that the YWCA was at 613 2nd Street NW. And the fact checker for The New Yorker called me and said, you know, the YWCA is actually at 132 2nd Street S, and I said, “That’s fine, but it doesn’t have enough syllables.” And they said, “Well, no, this is where it is.” I said, “No, just go away.” These two memoirs have some redundancies and also some contradictions. Why did you choose to include them?  I was raised by two people, and they each had a view of things and a view of me, and I had a view of them which was not always consonant. I felt like if I tried to make everything completely add up, it would renounce something true about the book.  Books are written by human beings. I knew that I was leaving some things inconsistent, and I was willing to do that for the sake of a certain kind of accuracy. But also, I wasn’t there. I was there after 1944, but I wasn’t there before that.  Entire paragraphs of this book are composed of strings of questions, without answers. Why did you choose to do this?  Regarding my father, since his absence was predominant in my life, it was to try to penetrate those absences, rather than just saying, “I don’t know,” which wouldn’t make much of a story. I thought that the questioning strategy for the narrator ― me ― was in and of itself interesting.  It reminds me of some of your stories.  And in Canada also. I think it’s just something that ― in the end of “Rock Springs,” when the narrator says, “Would you think he was anybody like you?” you want to give that question over to the reader in an almost conversational way.  I do it because there are certain stories in my past, that I didn’t write, but Frank O’Connor did, that seem to me to be touching and alluring, because they represent, in their first-person interrogative style, a certain kind of human impulse to understand what is otherwise not understandable. There’s a way, when you answer the questions that you pose, of gaining dominion over your life, and demonstrating that dominion. I guess that’s why. How has your Southern upbringing influenced your approach to writing? Well, I grew up down the street from Eudora Welty. I started off with the assumption that one could be a writer. You could be from where I was from and be a writer. It was something that was supported in the community.  I think also, because I grew up in a racist society, in which we were constantly being told that what wasn’t true was true, that I had a natural and have a natural skepticism about what I receive, and what I’m told. And that causes me to try to provide explanations for things that I don’t believe, and that’s a way in which fiction can operate. Fiction can be a kind of imaginative explanation of something, when the discrepancy between apparent fact and truth is too wide to believe. Even though you’re from the South, you tend to set your stories elsewhere.  Well, because everybody had written about everything I knew before I got there, and had done it better than I was going to be able to do it. If I had just let myself become a writer of the South, about Southern topics, for Southern readers, I wasn’t ever going to be a great writer, and that’s what I wanted to be. And I still do. And I had to be able to have a subject over which I was the world’s greatest expert. I was not going to be the world’s greatest expert about the South. First of all, I didn’t like the South very much, and second of all, I liked the literature that I knew about the South immoderately. Faulkner, Welty, Flannery O’Connor, Walker Percy. I thought that stuff was just great. Why did there need to be another one of them, which was all I was going to be able to be? How has your parents’ life on the road impacted you as a writer? I know in the book I call them transients. And in a sense they were people who didn’t, until I was born, stay in one place very long. And so I’m on a constant quest for some new experience that I could come to know and maybe use. I just never have been comfortable feeling, “This is my home and, by god, I have to stay here.” And my parents ― my parents were both in their own way fleeing certain circumstances that obviously didn’t make them very happy. Without being miserable and malcontents, and they weren’t because they found each other at a very early age and immediately started making each other wildly happy. So when I think about where I reside, I think I reside wherever my wife is.  Do you think you’ll write more memoirs in the future, or are you more likely to return to fiction for now? I don’t think I have anything else to write in a memoiristic way. I’ve written a few essays that are kind of memoiristic. My agent, who was very taken by the character of my grandfather really would like me to write a book about him, but I don’t know what I would write. He was a force of nature sort of guy, and did as best he could to ― he was a rakish guy, a real-chaser-after women. And I’m certainly not going to write any autobiographies. As close as this memoir comes to autobiography, that’s close enough for me."
ARTS & CULTURE," REVIEW:
It was a fantastic Saturday evening at BAM as the 'KODO' ensemble concluded its 3-day performance in Brooklyn of its One World Tour. If you are not familiar with the art of drumming called Taiko, it's an extraordinary drumming extravaganza and as a friend said, ""A great way to empty out aggressive energy."" Surprisingly Taiko is performed largely by females, but 'KODO' performers are mostly male. This ancient but modernized drumming requires tremendous dexterity and strength.  A gift of physical power and suppleness that requires a young body to engage with some drums that are larger in size than they are. With consistent & determined skill, 'KODO'S' artists harmoniously brought forth the shine and sparkle akin to the northern lights that can only be seen under perfect conditions.  Seasoned artistic director and performer, Tamasaburo Bando, who has often acted in traditional Kabuki Theater calls this production 'Mystery.' He explains that, ""In the folk arts that have been handed down across Japan, there's a sacredness, an air of mystery within prayers. The drums express this, and I'd like for the audience to feel it. I hope theater-goers will experience the same sort of other worldly splendor that you sense in a temple or a shrine, or when you discover things in nearby woods.""  Truly Mr. Bando with 'KODO' producer Nobuyuki Nishimura achieved this with their amazing ensemble of 15 performers, who transformed from dragons to musician's, from athletes to actors. With excellent choreography by Kazumi Boy and lighting design by Kenichi Mashiko, the stage was truly trafficking magic."
POLITICS,WASHINGTON ― A lot of stuff happened this month. Here’s a recap.
BUSINESS,"Once the darling of the sharing economy, Uber is knee-deep in a public relations crisis that has culminated in the resignation of its co-founder and CEO, Travis Kalanick. His shareholder-demanded departure is only the latest in a series of ousters and resignations at the company. In the last six months, the ride-hailing app has hemorrhaged high-ranking leaders as allegations of sexual harassment, a toxic workplace culture, corporate subterfuge and profiteering came to light and played out in viral social media campaigns ― and those are apparently just the tip of the iceberg.  Kalanick’s resignation doesn’t come as a surprise -- after he was caught on video chewing out an Uber driver who questioned the company’s compensation policies in February, even he admitted he needed “leadership help.” If the vacancies at the top of Uber’s ranks indicate anything, the whole company needs it.  Take a look for yourself:  This story has been updated to include details about Kalanick’s resignation."
ARTS & CULTURE,"On Feb. 22, French artist Abraham Poincheval moved into his temporary new home: a 12,000-kilogram (or 12-metric-ton) limestone boulder located inside Paris’s Palais de Tokyo art museum. He will reside there for a full week. The modest abode doesn’t offer much in terms of space. For his entire stay, Poincheval will sit in a Poincheval-shaped hole carved in the middle of the rock, his arms outstretched before him. Breathing holes have been punctured into the limestone, yet the artist will remain cloaked in darkness for the entirety of his stay, without knowledge of what time or day it is.  It’s all part of a performance piece (slash “mystical journey”) titled “Pierre,” which translates to “stone” in English. Over the course of the week, Poincheval ― whose work often revolves around intense challenges of confinement, isolation and meditation ― will detach from the human pace of life and learn to live at the speed of a mineral.  One of the less mystical aspects of the experience, however, is the fact that Poincheval, who will temporarily subsist on a diet of dried meat, cartons of soup and other liquids, has to pee in water bottles and store his excrement around him for the duration of his performance. In anticipation of the piece, Poincheval, 44, has been physically and mentally training for months. Yet how exactly the artist will react to the extreme conditions of his performance remains unknown. Thankfully, museum visitors will be able to keep the artist company, speaking to him through a crack in the middle of the rock. Poincheval will chronicle the emotional and logistical details of his rocky experience in a journal, explaining in very literal terms what it feels like to be the heart of a stone ― and basically entombed alive.  In an interview with The Guardian, Poincheval described his first days inhumed as comparable to a psychedelic trip. “It’s very complex,” he said. “You pass from one feeling to an another. Like you are being carried away on a raft. It’s like tripping. I am trying to explain (the feelings) in language but it very difficult to put down in black and white.” The artist has an emergency phone line in case of emergencies, though his prior performances suggest he’ll be just fine. In 2014, Poincheval took up residence inside the stomach of a dead bear for two weeks, where his diet consisted of worms and beetles. He’s also spent eight days buried under a rock, a week on top of a 65-foot pole, and 20 days underground as a human mole.  After “Stone,” Poincheval is moving on to an even stranger artistic pursuit, titled “Egg.” For this one, he will sit on a dozen eggs for between three and four weeks, with the hopes that they’ll hatch. “Pierre” runs from from Feb. 22 to March 1. “Egg” begins March 29 and will continue for a period of 21-26 days at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris."
BUSINESS,"Uber drivers in New York City may soon be getting a lot more tips from passengers. The city’s taxi and limousine commission agreed Monday to pursue a rule that would require ride-hailing companies to offer tipping as an in-app option for users. Unlike competitor Lyft, Uber does not currently enable passengers to tip through its app. People who support the rule hope it can make gratuities as common for New York’s Uber drivers as they are for the city’s taxi drivers. Cabbies regularly receive tips through their credit card readers ― a feature also mandated by the city’s taxi commission. The Independent Drivers Guild, a union-backed association that advocates for New York’s Uber drivers, petitioned the commission to pursue the tip rule. The group says it collected 11,000 signatures backing the proposal, including many from riders who would like to have the convenience of a tipping option.  Regulators will now hold a public hearing on the proposal. It would then have to be approved by the commission before being implemented. Jim Conigliaro Jr., founder of the drivers guild, told The Huffington Post that surveys indicate in-app tipping is a “top issue” for drivers. He said he hopes the tipping option could spread to other cities or states through similar regulations if it takes hold in New York.  “It’s just not possible to make it on straight UberX rates,” said Conigliaro, whose group is backed by the Machinists Union. “They really need tips to make ends meet.” Conigliaro said drivers can’t pay their bills “with stars” ― a reference to the ratings that customers give their drivers. An Uber spokesman said the company hadn’t yet reviewed the proposal but looked forward to seeing it. “Uber is always striving to offer the best earning opportunity for drivers and we are constantly working to improve the driver experience,” he said in an email. He added that the company had launched “a series of new tools and support policies for drivers” in New York, and partnered with the drivers’ guild to make sure drivers “have a stronger voice.” Uber passengers always have the option to leave a cash tip, but many choose not to because they don’t have cash on them or simply because they aren’t encouraged to. Drivers hope that creating the in-app option will make tips more customary, potentially significantly raising their take-home pay. Last month, Lyft announced that its in-app tipping option had hit the “milestone” of $200 million in driver gratuities. Luis Tavares, a member of the guild who’s been driving for Uber for five years, said his fares have dropped over time and that he finds himself having to drive more to bring home the same pay. “Allowing riders to tip is an important first step to helping drivers increase their earning potential,” Tavares said. This post has been updated with comment from Uber."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Now that blockbusters ― namely reboots and franchise fare ― have graduated from summer escapism to year-round fixtures, April is no longer a safe space at the multiplex. The month that once birthed “Field of Dreams,” “The Matrix,” “Election” and “Mean Girls” now belongs to the “Fast and the Furious” vehicles, Marvel and “Clash of the Titans.”  To see “A Quiet Place” rumble into theaters last weekend was to witness a small miracle. Heralding John Krasinski’s directing talents and notching an august $50 million opening, the post-apocalyptic creature feature is the sort of studio product meant to warm jaded cinephiles’ hearts: a high-concept crowd-pleaser that manages to be fresh and whip-smart ― an increasingly rare sight in the year of our big-budget Lord 2018. “A Quiet Place” boasts the highest-grossing April debut for an original film in history, as well as the heftiest intake for an original live-action release since “Happy Death Day” last October. The rest of April’s wide releases are, well, less thrilling. Oversized beasts are stampeding Dwayne Johnson and Naomie Harris, “Isle of Dogs” barks its way into more corners of the country, Shia LaBeouf flaunts short shorts in the otherwise staid “Borg vs McEnroe,” Amy Schumer stars in a feminist “Shallow Hal,” we finally get a sequel to ... “Super Troopers” (?), “Truth or Dare” turns its titular pastime into something deadly (Tyler Posey doesn’t take his shirt off in the trailer; skip it), and the Avengers threaten to put more superheroes on one screen than a VH1 Divas telecast. Those movies will flood multiplexes in the coming weeks, ushering us toward the blockbuster domination that is May, June and July. Meanwhile, three worthwhile underdogs opened opposite “A Quiet Place,” shouldering the month’s indie marketplace. “Lean on Pete,” “Where Is Kyra?” and “You Were Never Really Here” are hardly light fare, but isn’t there some adage about bleak movies being the perfect way to escape April showers? No? You’ll want to invent one after seeing this trio. We talked to the filmmakers responsible for these gems. If you don’t live near a theater where the movies are playing, add them to a list of rainy-day streaming options for later in the year, when you find yourself wondering who among us requested yet another Robin Hood retelling.  For fans of “Boyhood,” “The 400 Blows” and “The Black Stallion” Written and directed by Andrew HaighStarring Charlie Plummer, Steve Buscemi, Chloë Sevigny, Travis Fimmel, Amy Seimetz and Steve Zahn Lean on Pete is a racehorse whose cantankerous trainer (Steve Buscemi) describes him as a “piece of shit” ― catnip for our protagonist, Charley (Charlie Plummer), a motherless 15-year-old working the stables for $25 a day, partly as a respite from his aloneness and partly to gird his father’s (Travis Fimmel) limited income. Gentle Charley can’t stomach the thought of Pete being carted off to Mexico, where aged steeds are slaughtered once they are no longer moneymakers. So, in the dark of night, this spindly boy absconds with his beloved horse (an expert listener), trekking through the Oregon desert toward a broader horizon. On paper, it’s a quintessential coming-of-age tale. But in practice, writer and director Andrew Haigh sees “Lean on Pete” as the events that occur before Charley comes of age. And he’s right: Charley doesn’t yet have the means ― the familial support, the peers, the finances ― to determine his place in the world. The only thing that steadies him is a tender heart. “Until he finds somewhere to have a base, in order to grow, he can’t even deal with ideas of identity or who he’s going to be or what kind of man he wants to be,” Haigh said. “And also, I suppose, in all of my films, I can’t help but want to show a different version of masculinity.” Haigh is the master of compassionate relationship dramas, having explored a one-night stand in “Weekend,” a long-term marriage in “45 Years,” a group of gay friends on HBO’s “Looking,” and, now, a teenager and his equestrian companion in “Lean on Pete,” based on the novel of the same name by Willy Vlautin. It’s Charley’s desperate need to be kind, and to receive kindness from others, that grounds this particular relationship and separates him from the average teen boy. Whereas most kids his age are striving to master schoolyard politics or sibling rivalry, Charley is trying to conquer the oppressive ugliness of the world around him, hoping that relatives in nearby Wyoming will provide the stability he lacks.  “What do you do in your life if you don’t have support from your loved ones?” Haigh said. “Or you don’t have support from the society around you? It felt like it was something more important, almost, than just questions of identity. It was about something like, how do you survive in the world if you don’t have a framework?” Charley’s journey makes for a magnificent travelogue in which none of the travel is glamorous. With a parting shot that evokes “The 400 Blows,” this is one of the year’s best movies to date. Another recent release, “Ready Player One,” centered on an orphan in an ugly world, but its virtual-reality bedlam lacked humanity. “Lean on Pete” more than makes up for it, sending its hero ― Plummer’s performance is a wonder; a true star is born ― on an expedition through the great Northwestern outdoors that ends with an introspective discovery. Bring tissues; you’ll need a bunch.  For fans of “Klute,” “99 Homes” and Gena Rowlands movies Written by Darci Picoult • Directed by Andrew DosunmuStarring Michelle Pfeiffer, Kiefer Sutherland, Suzanne Shepherd and Sam Robards “Some people say it almost feels like a horror film,” Darci Picoult, the writer of “Where Is Kyra?,” said. “It becomes this terrorizing psychological deterioration.”  Those horror trappings are evident in Picoult’s sparse script, but they’re largely owed to Andrew Dosunmu’s shadowy direction. Working with Oscar-nominated cinematographer Bradford Young (“Selma,” “Arrival”), Dosunmu shades Michelle Pfeiffer’s titular Brooklynite with fuzzy grays and anesthetized blues. Laid off from her job and cashing her late mother’s pension checks for income, Kyra is often framed from a distance, the atrophy she’s facing as she nears senior citizenship foregrounded to reveal a genre of poverty rarely explored in popular culture. Picoult wrote “Where Is Kyra?” in 2013, surveying the aftereffects of the late 2000s’ economic crisis. She first set the movie in Detroit, which filed for bankruptcy that same summer. But Picoult and Dosunmu, who also collaborated on the Nigerian drama “Mother of George,” relocated the backdrop to New York, where the glaring disparity between haves and have-nots underscores everyday economic strife. What is a middle-aged woman to do when she finds herself unemployed and undesirable, reduced to placing advertisements on vehicles’ windshields and being turned down for gigs at fast-food restaurants in favor of younger candidates?  “I always envisioned Kyra being someone who, if you will, had a life that had promise, someone who believed things were going to work out,” Picoult said. “And then, when they don’t, it becomes even more disparaging because she’s holding on, hoping for something better that doesn’t happen.“ Pfeiffer, who made something of a comeback last year with “mother!” and “Murder on the Orient Express,” has found one of the richest roles of her career, looking more desperate with each rejection and more weathered with each dignity-shattering wakeup. Kyra’s corner of the world struggles to blossom into anything sunnier; farther and farther she drifts down the rabbit hole of anguish, Pfeiffer’s oceanic eyes absorbing every psychic bruise. For fans of “Taxi Driver,” “Good Time” and “Drive” Written and directed by Lynne RamsayStarring Joaquin Phoenix, Judith Roberts, Frank Pando, Ekaterina Samsonov, Alessandro Nivola and Alex Manette “You Were Never Really Here” demands to be seen twice: once to absorb its ethereal grime, and another to peek more clearly into its protagonist’s fractured mind. As Joe, a contract killer (and PTSD-addled war veteran) paid to extricate young girls from corruption, Joaquin Phoenix dances with the camera, angling through the New York streets, slipping between past and present, reality and hallucination. Joe is purposefully elusive, a design that is at once frustrating and hypnotic.  “I thought I was making an action movie, but it also became a character study,” Scottish director Lynne Ramsay, who adapted Jonathan Ames’ novella of the same name, said. “I think I just gravitated to the inner workings of the character.”  Those inner workings are bleak: At home, where he cares for his ailing mother (Judith Roberts), Joe sometimes covers his head with a plastic bag, wondering what would happen if he finally ended it all. Outside, he seems as likely to take a gun to his own head as he does to avenge the brutes holding innocent preteens hostage. But that’s familiar territory for Ramsay, who treats grief and death as leitmotifs (her other credits include “We Need to Talk About Kevin,” “Morvern Callar” and “Ratcatcher”). What makes “You Were Never Really Here” powerful is its ability to place us next to Joe, psychologically and physically, as he flits between avenger and avoider. Think Travis Bickle with a splash of the adrenaline-pumping “Good Time.” The movie telegraphs a woozy paranoia, aided by another stirring score from Jonny Greenwood, who composed the music for “We Need to Talk About Kevin” and last year’s “Phantom Thread.”  For Phoenix, the role encouraged a certain visceral improvisation. “We would make decisions in the moment, and sometimes there are things I’m reacting to in the moment,” he said. “There are times when other actors didn’t know what was going to happen because we didn’t know what was going to happen in that moment. And I think I probably like that way of working in general, but I think it was probably really applicable to that character and this experience.” You won't find that in ""Rampage."""
BUSINESS,"WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG has agreed to plead guilty to U.S. charges it cheated on diesel emissions tests for a decade, accepting the largest fine on an automaker ever, while a federal grand jury indicted six former VW executives for involvement in the conspiracy. Five of the six former Volkswagen executives are in Germany and it is unclear if they will come to the United States to face charges. One of the six, Oliver Schmidt, who was a manager in charge of VW’s environmental and engineering office in Michigan, was arrested in Florida on Saturday. The six held “positions of significant responsibility at VW, including overseeing the company’s engine development division and serving on the company’s management board,” U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said, declining to say if any higher level executives could face charges. “Over the course of a conspiracy that lasted for nearly a decade, they seriously abused those positions.” On Monday, Schmidt was accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States over the company’s emissions cheating and the automaker was charged with concealing the cheating from regulators. According to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Detroit, VW will pay a $1.5-billion civil fine and $2.8-billion criminal fine. It would have faced higher fines if it hadn’t agreed to spend an estimated $11 billion to address consumer vehicles. After the company pleads guilty to the three-count felony criminal information - conspiracy to commit fraud, obstruction of justice and entry of goods by false statement - it will be formally sentenced. VW admitted that six unnamed supervisors between 2006 and 2016 agreed to mislead regulators and customers about the standards. The Justice Department said VW officials told engineers in 2012 to destroy a document that detailed the cheating and that lawyers prodded employees to destroy documents. VW will face oversight by an independent monitor for three years and has agreed to make significant reforms. The company agreed to fire six employees, suspend eight and discipline three who participated in diesel misconduct. The agreement still must be approved by U.S. District Judge Sean Cox in Detroit. The world’s second-largest automaker confirmed Tuesday it had negotiated a $4.3-billion concrete draft settlement with U.S. regulators to resolve its diesel emissions issues and plans to plead guilty to criminal misconduct as part of the civil and criminal settlement. The VW plea agreement says the automaker could have been fined as much as $34.1 billion for its criminal conduct. Volkswagen had previously agreed to spend up to $17.5 billion in the United States to resolve claims by U.S. regulators, owners and dealers and offered to buy back nearly 500,000 polluting vehicles. The automaker was in intensive talks with regulators in recent weeks in an effort to reach a deal before the end of the Obama administration. Without a deal by next week, a final resolution could have been delayed by months until the Trump EPA and Justice Department teams are in place. VW admitted in September 2015 to installing secret software in hundreds of thousands of U.S. diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and make them appear cleaner than they were on the road, and that as many as 11 million vehicles could have similar software installed worldwide. Much of the company’s senior management departed following the scandal, including chief executive Martin Winterkorn.   (Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington and Andreas Cremer in Berlin; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Nick Zieminski)"
ARTS & CULTURE,"Paula Vogel’s “Indecent” is many things: an idiosyncratic mix of music, memory and theater magic; a female take on an infamous male intellectual; a Holocaust parable that manages to surprise; a lesbian love story both lyrical and consumed with lust; a provocative piece of found history that holds up an eerie mirror to our times. The Pulitzer-winning playwright, author of more than a dozen distinctive works, has been talking to countless audiences about her first show to land on Broadway—a piece that has been germinating since her twentysomething self—and two decades later another student, future “Indecent” co-creator/director Rebecca Taichman—separately discovered the same censored story. Vogel spoke with me a few days before the Tonys, which she planned to attend as a Best Play nominee. Is it strange to be where you are now? Are you surprised to be on Broadway? I find it just a continuation of what I’ve been doing. It’s like going from Rhode Island to Texas—the roads are the same, and the people are lovely, just everything’s a slightly larger scale. Do audiences react in ways you don’t expect? I’m really amazed the audience who come to see the show respond in the way I responded when I wrote it, that they laugh and cry and that they want to talk about it. Whenever I can, I stop in front of the theater, and conversations with audiences can go on for an hour to two hours after the show …. I’ve always said that playwrights write the script, and the director and the cast and the designers write the production, but the play is actually written by each audience member. So every night there are 500 different plays. When I come out, people want to tell me the play they saw. Theater is such a fragile living thing; I marvel at the bravery of everyone involved in it. When you were a little girl, did you think this was what you’d grow up to be? I grew up below the poverty line in a fairly dysfunctional family, and the thought of going to a restaurant, much less going to a theater, was sort of out of the question. It wasn’t until I was 15 years old in high school and I walked into a drama class—I couldn’t believe what I was seeing and hearing. And the teacher said, “Just sit down. Take a seat and be quiet.” I stayed through a rehearsal of “Skin of Our Teeth,” and I went up to him, I said, “I don’t ever want to leave.” And he said, “Okay, you can sign up for the class.” And he put me to work; my first job was stage manager. From that point on—I think every theater artist tells you the same story—I was hooked. I’ve never been bored a day in my life since that day. Of course, each production is at the mercy of the individual dynamics of the people in it—it can be heaven, it can be hell. But you forget all the hells when you’re in heaven. Do you remember a moment where you realized you were in fact a playwright? I put it off for a long, long time, saying that, which I sometimes think is symptomatic of women. I started teaching when I was 23, at Cornell, and my job became all-consuming—at age 33 at Brown University I designed and ran the playwriting program there, raised money so that it was free for anyone admitted, plus we gave them stipends—and I was writing plays, but I didn’t really say, “Okay, I’m a playwright,” until I wrote “Baltimore Waltz.” There was something about that experience—finding that theater could literally not only change my life but change my emotional DNA, in a way I hadn’t realized until I lost my brother to AIDS. I realized that theater can bring back the dead, that theater is always in the present tense, instead of people who are in the past tense. There is that strange alchemy we feel when we enter an empty theater: There’s a ghosting that happens, and an energy actors leave behind when they’re creating a character who doesn’t exactly exist but [whom] they’re giving their own life force to, and that energy remains behind on the stage. All of us who work in theater feel it. How did you invent the vocabulary to take something so painful and find comedy? I think it’s a family voice—the funniest, most alive moments I’ve spent are sitting shiva for my grandfather, or at the funerals—the stories that are told, the laughter. Is it painful? Yes, but “Baltimore Waltz” made me believe in catharsis, and I discovered as I wrote about my brother that I felt joyful. That there was a release, a comedy. I actually now believe that if we don’t laugh, we can’t grieve. That strange exhilaration that I think also exists in [Vogel’s Pulitzer-winning] “How I Learned to Drive,” and certainly exists in “Indecent,” is really having a great wake, a great shiva—just a great party for people we’ve lost. Because there’s something frozen if we don’t allow ourselves to experience the full panoply of human emotions.  As a culture we are terrified of facing grief and facing death. We change the subject, we don’t delve in deeply enough—it’s seen as being morbid. I don’t think it’s emotionally healthy. Theater is very much a conduit of not being frozen, of facing something collectively so that we can change our emotional DNA. We leave the theater feeling a kind of lightness of being. “Baltimore Waltz” sprang from your need to address the loss of your brother. Was there a particular kernel that sparked “Indecent”? Actually, I think in a way I continue to write in a conversation with my brother. All of us who have lost somebody too young know this experience. I’m 30 years older than my [late] older brother, but I’m still having the conversations in my head. He actually said something about that when he was dying, that finally I would get the last word. Do you? Or does he answer? [Laughs] As long as he could read—he lost his sight as one of the last senses that he was losing from HIV—he delved into Holocaust literature. When I asked him why, he said, “Do you realize that half of our family has always been killing off the other half?” And I thought about it: Russian Jew, German Jew, German Catholic, German Protestant. Spanish and French. And that’s what was happening in his body, half of his body was killing off the other half. That ancestry of violence had actually worked down to the cellular level. That’s not at all profound! [Laughs] Even if I am not a survivor, still in all, the Holocaust, for those of us of certain generations, lives in our body. So many younger people I’ve taught don’t feel it in their body; they think of it as a historical fact. I guess I was thinking of my brother: How can I write something that when younger people see it, the notion of Shoah lives in their bones? And not in a traumatizing way. My friend whom I brought to the theater said, “Is this going to be a Jewish play or a gay play?” You tell me. [Laughs] I would hope the specific of the story makes us think of the universality of immigrants, and America as an immigrant nation, and at what price and at what times and danger do we erect borders and walls. The truth of the matter is what we’re asking everyone is to do is what Sholem Asch did in 1906—we’re asking everyone to say, “Yes, I’m a lesbian.” When we think that he said that to a Yiddish theater audience, and Yiddish culture, in 1906, that’s profound. It frustrates me what stories are not considered mainstream, not validated as being worthy of Broadway. What I am hoping is that I live long enough to see “How I Learned to Drive” and “Baltimore Waltz” on Broadway. For a long time it’s been said to me, “Oh, you’ve written a woman’s play, it’s not universal”—and it’s so astonishing that we are making decisions on healthcare for women with an all-male panel in Washington, D.C.— And the notion that anything to do with childbirth is a “chick” thing, as if human beings would exist without it. There are plenty of days where I cry in my tea, but then there are other days—and one of the days was when we moved the show to Broadway. People say to me, “How do you feel?” It’s kind of funny and makes me laugh: If you just stand outside the club long enough, one day they’ll forget and keep the door open and you can just sneak in. The Mary Louise Parker/David Morse Vineyard production of “How I Learned to Drive” was one of the most perfect things I’ve ever seen. It stays with me still. That was a heaven. Everybody thought that it was on Broadway, in retrospect, isn’t that interesting? So then it was interesting to be told that it’s not a universal story, it’s not Broadway material... There’s a play I have to read, I understand it’s wonderful, a two-person play [with subject matter similar to “HILTD”] written by a British writer: “Blackbird.” Not only has it been on Broadway but the revival now has been on Broadway. I hope that in the next 10 years my plays will be seen as universal as his are seen. I think we find excuses to exclude women while ignoring the practice of what’s [accepted when the authors are male. “Indecent”] is an homage to a male writer who’s very beloved and is in the canon, [which I did] purposefully to try to break through. You’ve been a mentor to many people. Is that how art is allowed to happen? Is that the only way that it does? I had mentors in teaching; I didn’t have mentors in theater. Mentoring for me was a selfish thing: That was how I tried to stop being bitter and write the next play, by believing in our art and craft. What better way than to surround yourself with really remarkable voices? And it stopped me from feeling self-pity, it stopped me from going, “Oh yeah, he got on Broadway and I didn’t.” I’m going to continue writing because it’s the only way I can feel and think about the world. You just believe in the importance of doing this for a lifetime. I always said I wanted people to enter [the classroom] as my students and leave as my peers and colleagues, and that I wanted them to make it in the field before I did. And I have seen several of my students on Broadway, so this isn’t my first time. As a mentor and a godparent and a fan and a believer I’ve been [on Broadway] for Nilo Cruz, for Quiara Hudes, for Sarah Ruhl, and they’ve all honored me by sitting next to me to watch their play. It’s not about getting through the door alone; it’s about forming circles. Circles rise faster than individuals can. So much of the resonance of “Indecent,” its timeliness about the foreclosing of the humanity of whole groups of people, and the hatred and the fear we live with today—one can say, “Everything is so urgent; how can I waste my time making art?” But it seems even more urgent now than ever that we speak to our creative spirit in light of the daily horrors in our current situation. I was particularly struck in “Indecent” by Asch’s inability to defend his production when it was attacked. In a conventional drama he would leap to champion his own work. I was somewhat mad at him that he didn’t defend the play. I did 40 drafts of “Indecent,” maybe 20 by the time we got to New Haven and the other half late at night while we were in previews, and as we were going from New Haven to La Jolla, so it took me a while to understand for myself: Our heroes are wounded. How do you write a wounded hero? How do you forgive a wounded hero? I started reading about the pogroms, trying to walk in his shoes, and then listening to how he spoke at 1950 and realizing how he must’ve sounded in 1923. He was painfully aware that he couldn’t speak English—and he was this brilliant, international, celebrated writer. What is that like, when people only hear the immigrant and not the writer? And we now look at the world with a different understanding of PTSD, which he must have felt, documenting the bodies on the street. What actually helped me was that terrifying image, I think it was an AP picture, when an aid worker picked up the body of a little 3-year-old who had washed up on shore, who would have been fleeing the massacres in Syria, this little boy had lost one of his shoes, and the limp little body—it so destroyed me that I thought, “Of course, this is what he was seeing on a daily basis.” You said you sprang from a dysfunctional family. Were they able to be proud of your achievements? My father left home when I was 10. Both parents were dysfunctional—very funny and very brilliant and very dysfunctional. My mother did live long enough to see “How I Learned to Drive,” it was the first play of mine she’d seen. She was thrilled; she stayed up all night with me as the reviews were coming in and read every one. I had dedicated the play to her, but she died before the publication came out. My dad kind of floated in and out of my life, mostly out, and would disappear, but one night I came home and turned on my voicemail and it was my dad saying, “Honey, I just saw ‘How I Learned to Drive,’” and he started to cry. When I heard his voice I turned to my partner and said, “I think my dad is dying.” And he was dead in six months. At least it was wonderful to have that opportunity to hear them be proud before they died. Is your partner an artist as well? No. We’ve been together 28 years and married since—when did it become legal—2004. She is a biologist—and a biologist of gender study. She’s pretty brilliant. She’s kind of a pioneer, she’s written books. I’m used to carrying the luggage for her when she goes on these international speaking engagements. I really love it when theater artists within different schools say, “Anne Fausto-Sterling is your wife?!” She’s really groundbreaking. It’s wonderful to have two writers in the same house writing from very different perspectives. We read each other’s work. Her world is remarkable to me. How did you meet? We met at Brown University—she was the big woman on campus. We actually met first and I instantly fell in love, but we were both involved with other people, and I went, Oh, that’s why God created cold showers. And then four years later, what do you do when you’re breaking up: You go to the gym! I met Professor Sterling at the gym. It’s been an extraordinary gift to see the world through her work. It’s an interesting juggling act, because she is so engaged in her research and I’m teaching, that we kind of negotiate when we come to each other’s events and block off time. But I’m about to go to Spain to hear her new lectures in Madrid and Barcelona, and I can’t wait. Have you seen a marked change in the response to your work since the ’90s with “Hot and Throbbing” and “Baltimore Waltz”? We’ve lunged ahead in awareness and—I don’t want to say “acceptance”—maybe communion on the subject of sexuality generally. You were writing these things at a time when it was much more difficult to be gay. I’ve felt progress, but I must also say that I’m very worried that we’re facing an extreme counterrevolution. What people haven’t remarked upon—”Hot and Throbbing” is only done at 90-seat theaters. One of the prime concerns of my life, having witnessed it, is violence against women—and that we call it domestic violence instead of really properly criminalizing it—and it hasn’t changed. Violence against women and children has not changed, it’s not been eradicated, and the other thing that hasn’t been eradicated is the sexual trade in women and girls. One of the things that’s interesting about “Indecent” is this was going on in 1906. Women are still being sold and enslaved—there is a worldwide trade and it is not looked at. So in terms of progress, gay progress and lesbian progress—I always find everything intertwined—we are not looking at racial and sexual justice and racial and sexual injustice. Any progress we make, to me, is fleeting because underneath it there’s the smoldering coal about to break out in conflagration of a hatred and a subjugation of women—and we’re not paying attention to that, and it’s smoldering away. I keep saying to younger women, “I’m from a generation that remembers when women died in the back streets from abortion.” That’s sort of my response to it: Yes, there’s progress, but the basic difficulty has not been examined, and we’re hiding it. Prior to the election I lived in constant dread because there’s such hatred of women, among women as well—the women who are so socialized, so brainwashed that they turn their self-loathing outward and hate other women. It’s terrifying. We’re watching the counterrevolution and it seems inconceivable, but it’s happening. What has successfully been broken is the notion of coalition that I feel we’ve had at really important periods. The notion that—how can we celebrate progress when a man is choked to death by police because he’s selling cigarettes on the street? Why is that hidden? It’s in plain view. How are we celebrating gay liberation when there is a policing of the body that is ending up in countless deaths, and they’re not prosecuted? How free is our freedom? Only a few people have realized that in “Indecent” the way the women express desire is by saying, “I can’t breathe.” Whatever our liberation is, and whenever we do get to express ourselves, there’s a constant awareness that our bodies may be policed as a result of that expression. They do not belong to us. That’s right. And I don’t mean this to be glum. One of the hopes I have is that a younger generation will think of how to forge a coalition. There have been, briefly, coalitions between gay men and lesbians that keep getting severed. To me, to be a gay man—and this is based on the model of my brother—is to be a feminist, so I’m constantly in shock when I meet gay men who are not, or who call women that awful word, breeders. It’s extraordinary—I have not had children, I wanted to have children, but I always think when anyone has a child, they’re having in some sense someone who is in my family. Whoever gets born, that’s in my family, my community has increased. What the Republican right has done, very successfully, is broken up a coalition to where we’re now thinking of ourselves as nuclear families and nuclear communities instead of the larger community. How do we get back community values and eradicate the limits of family values—or enlarge the limits of family values where we’re talking about a larger family? The human family. Can you tell I’m a child of the ’60s? Trump is masterful at sowing chaos, but the searing editorials in the Washington Post, the New York Times, the L.A. Times, don’t do anything to puncture that chaos, because it’s so emotionally successful, so blunt and simple. I read a writer who pointed out that Republicans are skilled at framing something in the most direct emotional terms and the Democrats have not learned how to do that. I’ve been trying to figure out how to frame the truth—we have truth on our side, so why can’t we express it in simple terms that cut through the chaos? It’s hiding in plain sight, as you said, but we’re not giving it weight—because it’s not “chic,” somehow. We have to find language that gets through to everybody. I may not have the same trust in words, and the power of words, because what’s been under assault—there’s been an emptying of content of each word. Words mean polar opposites according to what party you belong to. Plus the entire sentence itself is suspect depending on what media outlet it comes from. We have actually trained a population to not believe not only in facts but in the words that bear them. Now this is where I feel some hope: I think that the reason Trump has so succeeded, like Hitler and Mussolini before him, is that they emotionalized words, they made words empty of their content and they emotionalized certain expressions and words. So what we’re responding to is emotional language and not cognitive language. The good news is that that is exactly what theater and film and music and songs do. When we talk about who can run as a Democrat: Who can emotionalize words? Bernie Sanders emotionalizes words, to some extent. Elizabeth Warren can to some extent emotionalize words. Who else is out there? To me—and it leads right back to “Indecent”—it’s not arbitrary that one of the first things that Hitler did was divide art into degenerate art and nationalist art. So all of the art that was emotionalizing the truth, giving us an emotional language, was suppressed and burnt until only national art remained. I think of the extraordinary artists in the ghettos who hid their photographs or hid their drawings so that people could see what the truth was afterwards. It’s not coincidental that the attack on the NEA started in 1980 by Jesse Helms. And the Republicans have long been trying to suppress the emotional language that arts gives us. This is where I think Sholem Asch was wrong: I think it’s precisely at the time of crisis that we need to create novels and theater and movies and television, because that’s the only thing that gives us a resilience—to show us that emotional truth. We do have to not just rely on individual artwork but create community work, go back to what we did in the ’30s with the WPA and the Federalist projects that were out there, make it accessible for everybody. Maybe we can create a framework for that to happen. I would love that."
ARTS & CULTURE,"We’d like to take a brief hiatus from the seemingly endless onslaught of daunting news about the future of our nation ― er, and human civilization ― with a sunnier report. The Metropolitan Museum of Art set a new attendance record this year with 7 million visitors, up from last year’s count of 6.7 million. It seems that, despite all the garbage going on in America, or perhaps because of it, people are turning to art for comfort and stimulation. America loves art! Woo!  The museum released the figures yesterday, which, as reported by Hyperallergic, encompass the institution’s fiscal year that ended on June 30. The attendance count combines attendees of the Met Fifth Avenue along with the Met Cloisters and the Met Breuer. The Breuer, which exhibits modern and contemporary art, opened in March 2016. That museum, housed in the former Whitney Museum building, drew 505,590 visitors with its inaugural shows last year ― including an exhibition of unfinished artworks and a stellar retrospective of Kerry James Marshall.  The majority of The Met’s guests, however, paid a visit to its Fifth Avenue location. The most popular show, “Age of Empires,” featured a massive trove of ancient Chinese archaeological finds. The second most frequented offered a glimpse into the dreamlike closet of avant-garde Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo. (Note: If Rihanna wears a work of art, people will flock to see it IRL.) It’s been a turbulent year for the arts, with the current presidential administration threatening to gut what little arts funding there is. The Met has had its fair share of controversy as well, with its former director Thomas P. Campbell resigning in February. So it’s heartening to know that, despite the struggle, The Met continues to draw New Yorkers and visitors from all over the world to its hallowed halls.  Congratulations, dear Metropolitan Museum of Art. You earned it! "
BUSINESS,"There’s no doubt the election of Donald Trump by the electoral college emboldened white supremacists and provided them bigger platforms upon which to spread their anti-diversity messages. Racists no longer feel confined to trolling people on Twitter and are suddenly removing their white hoods and boldly showing their faces at KKK rallies. This puts businesses in a precarious situation: if you discover, online or otherwise, that one of your employees is racist — and actively engaged in promoting white supremacy — what should you do? Google recently fired James Damore shortly after he spent his working hours producing a 10 page anti-diversity manifesto in which he speculated that his women colleagues were biologically inferior to men. After the manifesto went viral, Google’s head of diversity Danielle Brown issued a statement acknowledging the manifesto, disputing its accuracy, and reaffirming Google’s commitment to diversity. Google CEO Sundar Pichai went out of his way to remind young girls in tech, “You belong in this industry. We need you.” And lastly, Damore was the unfortunate recipient of the dreaded pink slip, namely for violating Google’s code of conduct. Google did the right thing by sending a powerful message about their unwavering commitment to diversity and rejecting harmful gender stereotypes. Research shows time and time again that diversity isn’t just a nice-to-have, but a strategic imperative. Research by McKinsey tells us that 35 percent of ethnically diverse companies outperform their competitors, and diversity in the boardroom generates better and more profitable ideas. Still, there might be some white supremacists among our workplaces. If you’ve hired a racist, what should you do? Acknowledge that you’ve hired a racist. It can be very powerful to email your workforce acknowledging that, somewhere in the hiring process, you miscalculated a person’s cultural fit for your business. If one of your employees marched alongside the KKK in Charlottesville, let your workforce know. They probably already know, and your silence would simply ring volumes. In fact, Twitter user @YesYoureRacist identified several of the speakers and protestors at Charlotteville’s white nationalist rally. Revisit your code of conduct and ensure you’ve inserted strong pro-diversity language. Beyond being a moral imperative, diversity in our workplaces is a competitive advantage. Any employee caught to have violated your code of conduct has proven themselves unfit and unwilling to live up to the values upon which you want your business to be run. Resource your employee resource groups. ERGs are a great way for women, minorities, and allies to build community and proactively respond to current events. Put your money where your mouth is: Fund these ERGs to the best of your ability and empower them to make big impacts in your workplace. Assess job candidates for their “cultural fit.” Consider asking job candidates “What have you done to promote diversity and inclusion in your previous workplace?” This is a great way to weed out KKK recruits and to ensure you’re hiring folks who, like you, value D&I. Fire any employee who acts on their racial animus. If your employee marched with the KKK in Charlottesville, that could warrant their immediate dismissal from your workplace.

ARTS & CULTURE,"It is easy to see why Massachusetts art teacher Christina Chang thinks standardized testing ""is not working for the kids."" When Chang, a veteran Burlington High School teacher of 12 years, asked her students to create art based on their feelings about standardized testing, the students' works came back with one common thread: stress.  ""The common theme was they didn’t like it, it was stressful, there may be better ways to do this,"" said Chang, who recently posted pictures of the artwork on her blog.
Student Josephine Samarjian's piece of art about standardized testing. Chang's students, a mix of 10th-, 11th- and 12th-graders, got the assignment in March, right after sophomores took MCAS tests. The MCAS, or Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System tests, are a set of statewide math and English exams that students are expected to pass to graduate.  Chang's students returned to art class after a week of testing with ""a lot of feelings"" about high-stakes exams, Chang said, and the first thing she thought was ""they need to express this with art."" She asked her students to write down how they felt physically and emotionally before and after taking the exams and then create a piece of art reflecting those feelings. She offered them materials like old Scantron sheets -- scoring sheets sometimes used in multiple-choice tests -- to use for their pieces.  Sophomore Rachel Carlino created a piece with words like ""ugly,"" ""nervous"" and ""failure.""  ""I don’t think it helps with what we’re learning and it causes kids a lot of stress and panic,"" Carlino told The Huffington Post, speaking about standardized tests.
Student Alyssa Healey's piece of art about standardized testing. Growing up in the No Child Left Behind era, Carlino is used to the annual stresses of standardized testing. ""I think it's always kind of been the same,"" she said. ""Even when you were little you would freak out because it was an MCAS day.""  The No Child Left Behind Act, passed in 2001, mandates that states test students on math and reading every year in grades three through eight and once during grades 10 through 12. Proponents of high-stakes testing say these tests hold schools accountable for their students' scores, allow parents to get a sense of how their kids are performing and reveal achievement gaps between groups of students. “I believe parents, teachers, and students have both the right and the need to know how much progress all students are making each year towards college- and career-readiness,” Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said in a speech in January. “That means all students need to take annual, statewide assessments that are aligned with their teacher’s classroom instruction in reading and math in grades 3-8, and once in high school.” Chang thinks ""the stress [standardized tests] put on my students is interfering with their overall learning,"" although she did not tell her students her personal opinions on the topic when giving this assignment, she said.  Below are some of the pieces of art Chang's students created."
BUSINESS,"By Kirill Bensonoff If it feels like everybody is talking about the cloud, it's not just your imagination. Worldwide spending on public cloud services is growing at 19.4 percent compound annual growth rate and shows great promise for 2017. Is your business dependent on cloud computing more than ever? What, if anything, will change in 2017? I have been in the IT business over 10 years. I started at IBM Global Services and then founded a company that grew into a national provider of IT services. I've witnessed the transition from customers buying hardware, installing on-premise email servers, worrying about disaster recovery, and running out of data center space. In other words, I've spent a lot of time analyzing trends, and I predict that the trend of cloud adoption will accelerate in 2017. Here's what to keep in mind if you're considering entering the business, or if you want to get ahead of the curve. IT Skill Sets Will Undergo a Shift to the Cloud As more companies adopt the cloud, the demand for people with cloud expertise increases. To respond to this, more IT departments will be making cloud-focused training a priority. Some of the training will focus on hosted databases, infrastructure-as-a-service, and cloud security. Companies will also look for employees that have experience with major cloud platforms like Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. Multi-Cloud Will Become Prevalent Amazon Web Services has, and continues to be, a market leader and innovator for infrastructure-as-a-service public cloud computing. However, Microsoft and Google are biting at the heels and will evolve into stronger competitors in 2017. Companies should start considering working with more than one cloud provider at a time - for cost savings, performance, disaster recovery and other reasons. Third party tools can help them manage multiple clouds and figure out which costs the least. We Will Slowly Move Toward Heuristic Automation IT automation will slowly transition from traditional scripting to defined workloads for tasks, and eventually arrive at heuristic automation, a form of AI that uses algorithms to decipher how a process works. As noted in this TechTarget piece, ""Start down the heuristic path by appointing an automation leader in IT, automating script discovery and rewarding administrators for building resilient, structured scripts."" Analytics Will Grow for IoT The Internet of Things (IoT) has already started generating vast quantities of data which is dumped into cloud storage. The next step is to improve our analysis of this data. Unfortunately, IoT data is often stored across disparate systems, making it difficult to access. In order to resolve this issue, analytics software needs to be able to connect to these databases and combine data from disparate sources. Once the data is properly mined, visualization tools can be used to help businesses make better decisions. IT Will Shift to New Types of Software Deployment While traditional IT departments have had to focus on maintaining and updating software and hardware, their focus with cloud will deal with new software deployments within the cloud environment. These complex deployments allow IT to show off their subject matter expertise and help manage change for the organization. Cloud Adoption Will Improve Customer Satisfaction Since companies can reduce costs, become more efficient and scale more easily with the cloud, it's allowing customer satisfaction to become more of a focus. Vendors know that a client can leave anytime, so they're making greater efforts to build long-term success for their customers so they will stay. This means they are providing better customer support and training to help customers to adapt to their cloud environment more easily. This allows for longer relationships and happy customers. Conclusion Cloud will continue to redefine how IT works and will free up businesses from the burden of physical limitations. For those involved in building and support tech, knowing public clouds intimately will continue to pay dividends. For those making business decisions, no major company technology initiative can be complete without evaluating at least two of the major cloud providers. Kirill Bensonoff is a seasoned entrepreneur and the founder of Unigma, a unified cloud management platform. Unigma has been featured in a number of publications, and Kirill blogs regularly about the cloud, tech and growing your managed services business. He can be reached at kirill@unigma.com."
ENTERTAINMENT,"R&B singer R. Kelly is blaming “rumors” for the cancelation of a scheduled performance at the University of Illinois at Chicago after students and staff petitioned against his appearance because of sexual misconduct allegations. “I don’t know why they canceled the show. I’ve never heard of a show being canceled because of rumors, but I guess there’s a first time for everything,” Kelly said in a video posted to Twitter on Sunday. Kelly has been dogged by dozens of allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct over the years, including operating a sexually abusive cult and producing child pornography ― a crime he was acquitted of. A woman recently accused him of infecting her with an STD. Kelly, a Grammy-winning Chicago native, hinted at legal action over being booted from Love Jam concert, scheduled for May 5 at the university pavilion.  “I’m going to try to get to the bottom line of it, you know, as far as my lawyers are concerned, and see exactly what happened and why I was canceled,” he said. The University of Illinois at Chicago’s Women’s Leadership and Resource Center also celebrated Kelly’s canceled performance on Facebook on Friday, calling it “a victory for all of us, but especially for Black women and girls!” On Monday, the Times’s Up movement’s Women of Color committee released a statement outlining reasons for rallying against Kelly and demands for an investigation into his conduct. The group wants Kelly probed for his alleged marriage to the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15, child pornography charges, lawsuits against him by women, and the recent cult claims. “We call on people everywhere to join with us to insist on a world in which women of all kinds can pursue their dreams free from sexual assault, abuse and predatory behavior,” reads the committee’s statement posted on The Root. “To this end, today we join an existing online campaign called #MuteRKelly. In a statement obtained by BuzzFeed, a representative for Kelly said the singer supports the Time’s Up movement but believes its attack on him is an “attempted public lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture.” “We understand criticizing a famous artist is a good way to draw attention to those goals — and in this case, it is unjust and off-target,” the statement read. “Time’s Up has neglected to speak with any of the women who welcome R. Kelly’s support, and it has rushed to judgment without the facts.” Kelly is slated to perform at the Greensboro Coliseum in North Carolina on May 11. Tickets remained on sale for that performance. A representative for the Greensboro arena did not immediately respond to requests for comment. This story has been updated with a response from a Kelly representative."
ARTS & CULTURE,"This week I talked with actor Jeff Hiller about the hit Off Broadway play Bright Colors And Bold Patterns that he’ll be joining on January 17th with a new opening night scheduled for February 4th. Hiller (Nightcap, 30 Rock & Broadway’s Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson) will step into the starring role of this devastatingly funny hit play directed by Michael Urie (Torch Song, Buyer & Cellar, Ugly Betty) and written by Drew Droege the play’s original star. Hiller will continue the play’s triumphant Off Broadway run through February 25th at the SoHo Playhouse in NYC. Bright Colors And Bold Patterns is about Josh and Brennan who are about to get married in Palm Springs on a lovely Saturday afternoon. However, the night before becomes a drunken, drug-fueled riot because their friend Gerry arrives furious that their invitation says: “Please refrain from wearing bright colors or bold patterns.” The play is produced by Zach Laks in association with Riki Kane Larimer and features set design by Dara Wishingrad. Tom DeTrinis serves as associate producer. Bright Colors And Bold Patterns was originally presented at VS Theatre in Los Angeles and directed by Molly Prather. I talked to Jeff about how thrilled he is to perform Drew Droege’s hysterical one man show and his spin on our LGBTQ issues. LISTEN:   When asked how he sees our LGBTQ community moving forward in this Trump administration Hiller stated: Jeff Hiller is a regular performer at the UCB Theatre in both New York City and Los Angeles. Jeff has also written and starred in a pilot for Universal Cable Productions as well as acting in pilots for NBC, Fox, and CBS. He will step in the role of Gerry in the hit Off Broadway play Bright Colors And Bold Patterns starting on January 17th at the SoHo Playhouse in NYC.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Activist artist Dread Scott creates in a language of searing simplicity. His work subverts American iconography to reveal the brutal injustices embedded in our nation’s marrow.  Scott’s first major piece, “What is the Proper Way to Display a US Flag?” was on view at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1989, when Scott was just 24 years old. The participatory installation featured a photomontage of American flags in various circumstances ― draped atop the coffins of soldiers and lit aflame by South Korean students. A genuine American flag lay across the floor. Viewers, then, were invited to write down their thoughts on the proper way to display the flag, and potentially step on the flag during the process. President George H. W. Bush called the work “disgraceful,” which signaled to Scott that he was doing something right.  More recently, Scott erected a black flag reading “A Man Was Lynched By Police Yesterday” outside of Jack Shainman Gallery in Manhattan. The artwork was an updated version of the banner that hung outside the headquarters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1936, re-installed after Alton Sterling and Philando Castile were shot and killed by police in the summer of 2016.  The flag is now on view at San Francisco’s Guerrero Gallery as part of the exhibition “Past, Present, Future,” a show squarely aimed to address the current political moment, a reversal of progress for those who have spent their lives marginalized, silenced and oppressed. Along with the flag, Scott will also show a piece entitled “IMAGINE A WORLD / WITHOUT AMERICA,” named after a quote by Bob Avakian, leader of the Revolutionary Communist Party, USA.  “I first read it in 1989 and it stuck with me,” Scott told The Huffington Post. “I began to think of it it as a provocative thought experiment.” The piece features a map of the world, the perspective shifted so that the United States is dangling off the image’s edge, barely visible and ostensibly irrelevant. The piece dares Americans to put their own nationalism in check and imagine a radically different world where they are not the focus.  For decades, Scott has made blistering artwork that refuses to let America avert its gaze. In this current political climate, when years of progress are in danger of being reversed, his unapologetic work needs to be seen. We reached out to Scott to discuss.  How would you describe the way art and activism coexist in your work?  I generally keep my art and activism somewhat separate. Typically my art isn’t bringing people to a demonstration or seeking particular demands, which my activism typically is — including when I encourage people to be part of a movement for revolution, a revolution to get rid of this entire system and replace it with one that would meet the needs of humanity as a whole. That said, for much of the last three decades, my work has been addressing some of the big questions confronting people. As art, which I show in major museums, in galleries and on street corners, the work is engaging the viewer and encouraging him or her to think about these questions. I began doing this when I was an undergrad. In the 1980s that wasn’t what you were taught to do with art, and my initial works tried to keep my political ideas and my art separate. But the more I looked at the world and discovered artists ― Leon Golub, Hans Haacke, Roy DeCarava, Alexander Rodchenko and others who were bringing their politics into their art ― I searched for ways to do that with my concerns and aesthetic.  It’s crazy to think you made the work “What’s the proper way to display a U.S. flag?” when you were only 24 years old. What was your reaction when the president commented on your work?  When President Bush Sr. called my work “disgraceful,” my response was: “The President knows about my work and doesn’t like it. Good.” It meant that the work was engaging in a discussion on a national level about an important question. And if the head of this empire didn’t like what I was doing, it was an indication that the work was powerful and that it clearly stood with the people I cared about and the people that Bush wanted to continue to oppress and exploit. The way you folded viewers’ reactions to that piece into the work, it reminds me almost of a proto-social media experiment. Do you think there is any danger in giving a stage to those who respond to your work with such hate and negativity?  Giving voice to white supremacist and vitriolic defenders of America can be a problem. But in the context of the “What is the Proper Way to Display a US Flag?” I think that they became part of the dialogue I initiated and they look like the racists and warmongers that they are. The context is important.  You’ve spoken about the importance of widespread exposure, in terms of ensuring an artist’s work extends beyond a small, uniform subset of people. Has the internet changed how your work is processed and responded to? The internet has enabled some of my projects to reach a wider audience and be seen by people who wouldn’t otherwise see it and also to be studied by students who would not have this level of access if they had to look for a monograph on me or hope that their professor had actual slides. I’m happy that works like “A Man Was Lynched by Police Yesterday” spread in many ways in social media and people far outside of the art world were able to see it and share it. My video, “Anti-Campaign Ad,” was seen by over 10,000 people in a month and that would not have been possible without the internet ― unless it was shown at a major museum, which would never happen within days of it’s creation. You’ve mentioned, in previous interviews, critiques of your work that frame you as a “shock artist.” Can you talk about the difference, if there is one, between shocking work and challenging work, and where you see yourself fitting in? I don’t make work to shock. This is a profoundly polarized world and if you make work that looks at important questions people are bound to be passionate about it. When the police kill 1,100 people each year, making work that calls out these murders will bring joy to people under the gun of the police and people who don’t want a society where the state gets away with murder after murder after murder. Murder by police should be very controversial, but unfortunately these murders are the status quo, and it is making art about it which some view as shocking.   Your “A Man Was Lynched by Police Yesterday” piece was adapted from a flag made in the 1920s. Do you believe our society has made true progress in terms of racial justice [since then]?  The means in which people are oppressed and exploited has changed over the past 240 years, but there is a real continuum between a society that was founded on slavery and genocide and a society that imprisons 2.3 million people, 1 million of whom are Black. Ending slavery took a war. The ideas that rationalized slavery continued under Jim Crow and an economy that fed off the labor of the enslaved continued to brutalize the descendants of the enslaved. After the tremendous fight and sacrifice of the Cilvil Rights and Black Power movement, Jim Crow was replaced by what Michelle Alexander has dubbed the New Jim Crow. So there are changes, but ask the parents of Tamir Rice or Mike Brown whether much has changed since the ‘20s. Ask Muslims who have had hijabs ripped from their heads or Latino students barred from their own school by white students yelling “White Power” and “Trump Trump Trump” if racism has ended or changed much. Many have spoken about Trump’s election as a backlash to the strides made in terms of social justice over the past few years. Can you talk about how you see the relationship between the past, present and future ― and whether the brutal cruelties of the past can ever be left behind? I don’t think that Trump’s election is a backlash based solely on ideas or revenge, but rather what the ruling class in this country sees as a way forward in a world where they face many challenges, including many problems they have created. They are trying to continue to dominate the world and are facing challenges from old rivals and new ones. And those white people that are being used by Trump to consolidate his power, many of them want the unfair advantage that white supremacy afforded them for generations, that has been slightly undermined since the ‘60s. In short, if there are jobs or cheap bank/government loans, they want to go back to a time when those advantages definitely go to white people first without question. And repression should go to black people and Latinos first. And along with all of this this, many want to put women back in the 1950s or 1850s as well. But it’s not a backlash, but rather what’s going on in the economy, where based on the international competition, the U.S. and most other industrialized powers no longer can create the middle class existence for broad sections of society that was important to Western societies for the past 40 years. And in America, this system is going back to some of its key pillars ― white supremacy, patriarchy and Christian fundamentalism ― to negotiate the waters of continuing domination of the world. But I have no interest in the expansion of the U.S. empire or its continued domination of the planet. The cruelties of the past, and present, can only be gotten rid of through revolution. You need to get rid of a system and economy that are based on exploitation if you want to get rid of exploitation. If you want to end racism, you need to get rid of the system that was founded upon it and that has it woven into its very fabric, including its founding documents. Democracy and freedom in the U.S. was conceived of based upon owning human beings. The legal and political framework embodied in the constitution includes slavery. Slavery was not an aberration, mistake or “original sin”, but something that was integral to U.S. democracy. You can’t get to a society without exploitation if your vision of that is bound to a document where the freedom of some necessitated the enslavement of others. So I think that it’s possible to leave the cruelties of the past behind, but only if you make revolution to get rid of a system that needs these cruelties.  How have recent technologies ― including the internet, social media, cameras, video, etc ― contributed to this relationship between past, present and future? Do you see them playing a positive or negative role in the fight for racial justice? Technologies are not positive or negative. The same internet that helped the Arab Spring is used to spy on people all over the planet. It all depends whose hands it’s in. Will the Googles, Apples and Facebooks of the world build Muslim databases or will they refuse to do so? Will they build strong encryption into all technology and enable social justice activists and others to keep government snoops out of their data and prevent them from learning their connections through metadata? Or will they comply with government orders to build in back doors and turn over data, and not even inform people about secret laws and orders? The Freedom Riders broke the law and challenged social order. Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning may have have broken the law but their kind of courage is what is needed on a widespread level, including by corporations to stand up to tyrannical governments. “Dread Scott : Past, Present & Future” runs until March 5 at Guerrero Gallery in San Francisco. "

I encourage you to please engage in this discussion. I am watching the Sam Mendes production right now and Amy is about to not get married! This song can make or break my critique. Did you know it's even faster than Guns and Ships from Hamilton? Jon said  ""Raul's Bobby was robbed of the Tony. I saw it in Cincinnati and on Broadway and it was just devastating. I've seen the tape of the original cast recording and the national tour that was one of the first in the library at Lincoln Center. I didn't like the Ken Cen version much; the book scenes worked but the musical choreography was weak. NPH and the recent cast were strong, but my favorite as a whole is Sam Mendes production starring Adrian Lester, whose .... fueled 2nd act opener blew me away. It's available in it's entirety on You Tube and a most interesting take."" Debra weighed in ""I've only seen Raúl Esparza and Neil Patrick Harris as Bobby. Esparza's performance is heartbreakingly beautiful. I've never seen (or felt) a performance quite like it.""

If you're NY1 trash like me, you'll love this throwback interview about Company: Any Broadway buff owns multiple versions of the same musical. My collection is on iTunes because Apple TV is easy. It is a shame I cannot put my movie collection, which includes Les Mis x2 and the Miley Cyrus Bangerz Tour, on display. I prefer the 20th Anniversary Concert Les Misérables with Norm Lewis:  I have already watched Raúl Eduardo Esparza as Bobby this week. For no real reason, I decided to switch it up and put on the Neil Patrick Harris version of Stephen Sondheim's Company. This NPH version has Stephen Colbert and Patti LuPone. The audience is more noticeable in the latter, a circle theatre. Which is your favorite? Have you seen the show live? I'm jealous. Please let me know in the comments your favorite Bobby.

ARTS & CULTURE,"“This collection pulses with relevance,” Dave Eggers writes in the foreword to Complete Stories, a soon-to-be-released collection of Kurt Vonnegut’s short fiction that’s set to include five never-before-published stories by the Slaughterhouse Five author. The eagerly anticipated book, edited by longtime Vonnegut associates Jerome Klinkowitz and Dan Wakefield, hits shelves on Sept. 26. Arriving a decade after the prolific writer’s death, the historic survey of Vonnegut’s work brings his affecting cultural criticism ― and empathetic storytelling ― back into the spotlight. Having lived through the politics of World War II and the ensuing Cold War, the contentious U.S. interventions in the late 20th century, the rise in xenophobia and religious intolerance following 9/11, and an alarming surge in climate change denial throughout, Vonnegut’s writing explodes with disquieting warnings and lessons that continue to ring true for contemporary readers. His “moral stories,” Eggers adds, “tell us what’s right and what’s wrong” about the way we choose to live. “The satisfaction we draw from seeing some moral clarity, some linear order brought to a knotted world, is impossible to overstate.” All in all, Complete Stories consists of 97 short stories written over the course of his career spanning 1941 and 2007 ― five of which were only recently unearthed. “As a longtime Vonnegut scholar, Jerome knew there were some unpublished stories,” Wakefield told HuffPost. Heeding Klinkowitz’s advice, Wakefield went to the Vonnegut Archive at The Lilly Library in Bloomington, Indiana, last summer, and found several versions of a story called “The Drone King,” among other rarely seen and unfinished works. “Most all of Vonnegut’s stories were published in the 1950s and all but a very few were written in that decade, as well as the early ’60s,” Wakefield explained. Famous Vonnegut tales like “Welcome to the Monkey House” (1968) and “Harrison Bergeron” (1961) spin off the horrors of pharmaceutical dystopia and governmental egalitarianism gone wrong. “The Drone King,” recently teased in The Atlantic, is less fantastical, but appropriately reminiscent of Vonnegut’s ability to infuse delightfully bizarre scenarios with a dose of societal relevancy.  “Some of the later stories in the early ’60s reflected cultural changes,” Wakefield said. “One story published in 1963 in Redbook magazine told of a woman whose life changed when she read a new book called Woman, The Wasted Sex, which was modeled on Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique, which was published that year.” Complete Stories stands as the first comprehensive gathering of Vonnegut’s far-reaching body of short fiction. Like Eggers, Wakefield agrees that there’s a certain power to the works being released today. “I think the same basic ethical questions exist today as they always have ― honesty, loyalty, betrayal, fame and fortune versus your own standards,” he qualified. But one thing in particular has changed dramatically since Vonnegut’s short story-writing heyday: the overwhelming income gap between the rich and poor.  “Kurt was always for the underdog, for the downtrodden, and his favorite quotes were from ‘The Sermon on the Mount’ and the words of his fellow Hoosier, Eugene V. Debs: ‘As long as there is a lower class, I am in it; as long as there is a criminal class, I am of it; as long as there is a soul in prison, I am not free,’” Wakefield said. “It would be nice for people today to be reminded of the ethics those words are based on,” Wakefield concluded. “Young people have always appreciated Vonnegut, and find in his words new ways of looking at the world, and these stories will continue to awaken their curiosity and their sense of possibility.” Complete Stories by Kurt Vonnegut will be available on Sept. 26 courtesy of Seven Stories Press."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Temple University announced on Friday afternoon that the school is rescinding Bill Cosby’s honorary degree after the comedian was found guilty in his sexual assault retrial.  “In 1991, based on his career achievements, Temple awarded an honorary degree to William Cosby. Yesterday, Dr. Cosby was found guilty by a jury of the felony of aggravated sexual assault,” a statement from the university reads. “Today the Temple University Board of Trustees has accepted the recommendation of the University to rescind the honorary degree.”   Cosby, 80, was found guilty on Thursday on three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault by a jury in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The comedian was retried on three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault over Andrea Constand’s accusations that he drugged and sexually assaulted her in 2004. Constand, 44, was a former women’s basketball coach at Temple University, where Cosby was a trustee and major donor at the time. “Today’s decision provides additional facts for the university to consider with respect to Bill Cosby’s honorary degree,” Temple University spokesman Ray Betzner told the Philadelphia Inquirer after the verdict was handed down on Thursday.   Temple University forced Cosby to resign from his position on the board of trustees in 2014, and his name was removed from all buildings and scholarships at the school.   Several organizations, including Brown University and the University of Pennsylvania, revoked Cosby’s honorary titles after dozens of women accused him of sexual assault and rape. More than 60 women have accused the veteran entertainer of sexual assault, with many saying he drugged and raped them.  Cosby’s sentencing date has not been set. He could be sentenced to up to 30 years in prison or as little as five. Need help? Visit RAINN’s National Sexual Assault Online Hotline or the National Sexual Violence Resource Center’s website."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Emmanuel Jal, born in South Sudan, was only 8 years old when he was recruited to fight as a soldier in the Sudanese Civil War along with 12,000 other children. Miraculously, Jal was one of the few to escape, eventually finding his way to Kenya and enrolling in school. Today, he is a rapper, actor and social activist, who spins verses about his personal biography and his ongoing crusade for peace around the world. “I used to have a lot of nightmares,” Jal expressed in an interview with NPR. “Life was difficult then. But music became the place [where] I was able to see heaven. So through music I was able to dance, I was able to become a child again.” Jal is one of the subjects pictured in “Forthright ― Stronger than a Weapon,” a photography series by German photographer Sascha Kraus. The project pictures 43 hip-hop artists from Africa, Europe, Asia and the United States, all of whom use their craft to advocate for world peace and universal human rights. Far from just an exercise in frivolous entertainment, rap music is framed through Kraus’ lens as a bold and uncompromising tool for social change. “I am fascinated by what the artists do with their music,” Kraus said in an interview with Freelens. “With my project ‘Forthright,’ I would like to give them a platform and show what influence this movement has on a global scale.” Kraus pictures his subjects both performing and at rest, in black-and-white and in color, the depictions suggesting that a human being, when immersed in her element, can become something more.  Another featured rapper, Sister Fa, champions women’s rights in her lyrics, specifically speaking out against the practice of female genital cutting, which she experienced as a child in Senegal. Today, she uses music to ensure that girls no longer have to endure the pain that was inflicted upon her as a youth. “I am just trying to speak for the many women who cannot raise their voices,” she said in an interview with The Guardian. “I feel that when I talk, one person listens; but when I sing, thousands of people can hear my song.” Also pictured is Deeb, an Egyptian musician who performed in Cairo’s Tahrir Square during the revolution. “Rise up, O Egyptian / No revolution can be terminated in a night and day,” he sings in the song “Promised.” “Bear with yourself a bit / Have endurance and tolerance / Don’t fear on the cycle of production /  There should be a revolution against oneself / Tomorrow is better than the past.” Over 250 photographs make up “Forthright,” which are all compiled into a book disguised as an album booklet, complete with a selection of in-depth interviews and sample lyrics. Through the powerful publication, Kraus makes his purpose objectively clear: in today’s political climate, we don’t need more guns, more bombs, more war. We need words, we need music, we need the power of those individuals willing to risk their lives to speak their minds.  As written in the book itself: “Music is the language of our heart, so, we choose music as our weapon.” Purchase a copy for yourself here.  Every Friday, HuffPost’s Culture Shift newsletter helps you figure out which books you should read, art you should check out, movies you should watch and music should listen to.

POLITICS,"Conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt has a novel idea to curb school mass shootings: Ban trench coats. Hewitt, an MSNBC host, rejected limits on guns as a response to last week’s school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas, where police say a student used his dad’s shotgun and revolver hidden beneath a trench coat to kill 10 people. “To the teachers and administrators out there, the trench coat is kind of a giveaway,” Hewitt said Monday on “The Hugh Hewitt Show” on Salem Radio Network. “You might just say no more trench coats. The creepy people, make a list, check it twice.” Hewitt said he suggested coat control because he can’t see stepping on gun rights. Even universal background checks for gun buyers and a ban on assault-style weapons probably wouldn’t have prevented the Texas shooting, he said. “It is a Second Amendment right, it’s not a Second Amendment suggestion,” Hewitt said. “It’s as fundamental to the republic as free speech and freedom of religion and due process, and the right to be safe and secure in your own home.” Two teen murderers killed 13 people at Columbine High School in 1999 while wearing trench coats. They were initially incorrectly described as members of a group known as the “Trench Coat Mafia.” The Texas lieutenant governor said the problem in the Santa Fe attack was that there were “too many entrances” to the school. National Rifle Association head Oliver North blamed too many teenagers on Ritalin and a culture of violence. Listen to what else Hewitt had to say in the clip above."
POLITICS,"President Donald Trump called for the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner to be put to “rest” after a controversial roast by comedian Michelle Wolf on Saturday night. “The White House Correspondents’ Dinner was a failure last year, but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it,” Trump tweeted late Sunday. “The filthy ‘comedian’ totally bombed (couldn’t even deliver her lines-much like the Seth Meyers weak performance).” “Put Dinner to rest, or start over!” he concluded. By Monday morning, Trump declared the dinner “DEAD as we know it.” “This was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great Country and all that it stands for,” Trump tweeted. “FAKE NEWS is alive and well and beautifully represented on Saturday night!” Trump did not attend the event, but sent White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. He also boycotted the dinner last year. Wolf has drawn both condemnation and admiration for her blunt, brutal jokes about Sanders and Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, who also attended. “Every time Sarah steps up to the podium, I get excited because I’m not really sure what we’re going to get: you know, a press briefing, a bunch of lies or divided into softball teams,” Wolf said of Sanders. At another point, she said she mused about a tree falling on Conway, “not suggesting she get hurt, just stuck.” Many media figures at the dinner promptly took to their keyboards to say Wolf had taken things too far, instead praising the Trump officials in the room who faced the onslaught of criticism. Others defended Wolf’s set, saying she equally targeted others in the room, including Democrats and the media. Regardless, the president of the White House Correspondents Association distanced the group from Wolf amid the furor. “Last night’s program was meant to offer a unifying message about our common commitment to a vigorous and free press while honoring civility, great reporting and scholarship winners, not to divide people,” Margaret Talev, the WHCA president, said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the entertainer’s monologue was not in the spirit of that mission.” #WHCA Statement to Members on Annual Dinner pic.twitter.com/8DKoHNxpNi Wolf defended her set against some of the critiques on social media. Why are you guys making this about Sarah’s looks? I said she burns facts and uses the ash to create a *perfect* smoky eye. I complimented her eye makeup and her ingenuity of materials. https://t.co/slII9TYdYx This article has been updated to include additional tweets from Trump."
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — On a Sunday morning in February, a twin-engine turboprop passenger plane crashed in Iran’s Zagros Mountains. All 65 passengers and crew members were killed. The plane, an ATR 72, had been flying for nearly 25 years, about 10 years longer than the average U.S. aircraft is kept in service.  Ancient, dangerous airliners are the norm, not the exception, in Iran. For decades, U.S. and international sanctions have prevented Iran from buying new planes from companies like Boeing and Airbus, which dominate the global aviation market. Some of the sanctions have even complicated Iran’s ability to purchase spare parts and service its aging planes. The country now operates one of the world’s oldest fleets of civilian airliners, and it shows: There have been more than two dozen civilian airplane crashes in Iran since 2000. The 2015 Iran nuclear deal was supposed to offer Iran a chance to finally replace planes that Iranians sometimes call “flying coffins.”  Now that effort is stalled — thanks to President Donald Trump. When Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal last week, the Treasury Department said it would revoke licenses that allowed aviation companies to sell planes and parts to Iran.  As part of the nuclear agreement, the U.S. had agreed to issue licenses on a case-by-case basis to allow American companies (and foreign companies that use a certain amount of U.S.-origin components) to sell planes and parts to Iran. Shortly after the deal went into effect, Iran Air signed deals to purchase 100 planes from Airbus, 80 planes from Boeing and 20 from ATR, a Franco-Italian manufacturer. Iran’s Aseman Airlines reached a separate agreement to buy 30 planes from Boeing. In total, the contracts were worth about $40 billion.  But Airbus has delivered only three planes to Iran since the nuclear deal went into effect. The 2017 deliveries marked the first time Iran had acquired new aircraft in nearly 20 years. ATR has shipped eight short-haul regional airliners to Iran and plans to squeeze in more deliveries before the sanctions kick in in August, the Financial Tribune reported. Boeing has not yet delivered any planes to Iran.  Both Boeing and Airbus have backlogs of orders. Boeing, mindful of the Trump administration’s threats to pull out of the nuclear deal, had not started building the planes it agreed to sell to Iran. “We will consult with the U.S. Government on next steps. As we have throughout this process, we’ll continue to follow the U.S. Government’s lead,” Boeing Vice President Gordon Johndroe said in a statement after Trump’s announcement. An Airbus spokesman said the company is analyzing the situation and plans to consult with its customers. ATR did not respond to a request for comment. Before Trump came into office, the U.S. government had long viewed easing restrictions on aircraft sales as an area “ripe for cooperation” between Washington and Tehran, said Suzanne Maloney, a former State Department Iran adviser.  “It was viewed as a win-win that would help the U.S. business community — and the broader perception was that it would contribute to the quality of life and better safety standards for Iranians,” she continued.  When planes crash in Iran, the country’s state-owned media reliably blames U.S. sanctions for putting Iranian civilians at risk. But even amid climbing fatality figures, hard-liners in the U.S. urged Western airplane manufacturers to stay out of Iran, arguing that the Iranian military would divert civilian planes to send troops and weapons to Syria. After the nuclear agreement went into effect, Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) pushed legislation through the House to block the Treasury Department from granting companies like Boeing licenses to sell aircraft to Iran.  Sanctions experts say concerns about Iran diverting civilian aircraft are overblown. The Iranian government is eager to upgrade civilian airplanes — and Western companies that sell to Iran do extensive due diligence to make sure they won’t be implicated in Iran’s military endeavors. The people who warn that selling civilian aircraft to Iran will boost the country’s military are using “the same sort of scare tactics they drummed up to kill the” nuclear deal, said Erich Ferrari, a lawyer who specializes in sanctions law. “If they feel OK and they can sleep at night knowing that people are falling out of the sky from all over the world … I guess that’s the thing they have to live with.”"
ENTERTAINMENT,"Warning! Not even the Avengers can save you from the possible spoilers below for “Infinity War” and “Avengers 4.”  If you’re still reeling from the end of “Avengers: Infinity War,” take solace in the fact that you’re not alone in your misery. You, like everyone else, still have to wait a year for the second half of the story, which will take place in the Russo brothers’ upcoming, still-untitled “Avengers” movie. Or do you? An interesting idea popped up in the Marvel spoilers subreddit this month, after user ilurkthingsreborn claimed to have access to an inside source with intelligence on the upcoming movie. Specifically, intel on the fate of Captain America and the weapon he’s hinted at wielding for some time. Now, stay with us here, because in the world of leaks things can get complicated quickly. A bit of background information: An account with the name ilurkthings existed prior to the ilurkthingsreborn version, and it leaked accurate plot points about “Infinity War” weeks before the movie’s release, apparently revealing details about the post-credit scene and Spider-Man’s death in Iron Man’s arms. That account has since been deleted, but you can still see remnants of it when Redditors refer to ilurkthings leaks. This new account, ilurkthingsreborn, is allegedly the same person(s) using the same Marvel source(s). Subreddit moderators have allowed this May 1 post to remain in the forum for more than a week; they’ve given no indication that ilurkthingsreborn isn’t the same leaker as before. Now to the post. It contains a lot of disparate details. The plot of “Avengers 4” will revolve around the Avengers who survived Thanos’ deadly finger snap in “Infinity War” going back in time, possibly to retrieve the Infinity Stones (using a Tony Stark-made Infinity Gauntlet) to prevent Thanos from ever procuring them. Hulk will also apparently use the Stark Gauntlet and lose his arm in the process. It sounds like a bunch of really riveting fan fiction until you get to one particular piece of information that could validate the whole thing. It pertains to a fight scene involving Captain America, Thor and Thanos: I was told that at one point bearded Steve and Thor have a fight scene against Thanos where Thor gets blown away and Cap actually ends up weilding Mjolnir because he has finally been found worthy. However I was told that Thanos does end up killing Cap.  OK, setting Cap’s possible death aside (fans were predicting he’d kick the bucket in “Infinity War,” and that didn’t happen), this “leak,” if true, could provide an answer to a long-standing question in the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Yes, Cap is worthy of Thor’s hammer, Mjolnir. At first, the Reddit detail about the hammer seemed questionable for a few reasons. Primarily because Thor’s sister Hela shattered his hammer in “Thor Ragnarok” (2017), causing the god of thunder to wield a new weapon in “Infinity War,” dubbed Stormbreaker. Getting the new weapon is a significant part of Thor’s storyline. So why would Mjolnir come back into play in the proceeding movie? This requires an explanation, right? Then I remembered an interview I had with the directors of “Infinity War” and the upcoming “Avengers 4” film, Joe and Anthony Russo, following the release of “Captain America: Civil War” (2016) two years ago. During that interview, I asked them about Cap and Mjolnir. It’s important to know that in the MCU, only characters who are “worthy” can pick up Thor’s hammer. No one knows exactly what “worthy” means. But if you’re not worthy, then stop. There’s no hammer time. But in “Avengers: Age of Ultron” (2015), Captain America attempts to lift Mjolnir, and it moves ever so slightly in the process. He doesn’t succeed in picking it up, but Thor is effectively spooked by Cap’s abilities. It seemed relevant enough a budge to ask the Russos, since I had the opportunity, whether Cap was actually worthy and just let go too soon. Their cagey responses had my spidey reporter senses tingling, even back then. “I don’t know that might be a ...” Anthony Russo said, considering his words, “that might be a question for future storytellers.” “Might be a little too specific for us to answer,” Joe Russo said. A question for “future storytellers”? Might be “too specific for us to answer”? The Russo brothers directed “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” (2014) and “Captain America: Civil War” (2016) for Marvel. If anyone knew about Cap’s worthiness at the time, it was them. I didn’t end up including the Mjolnir/Cap quotes in my story two years ago, but why were they being so coy? Could it be that Cap holding Thor’s hammer was a spoiler for one of the Russos’ two then-yet-to-be-released “Avengers” movies? (Mjolnir didn’t appear in “Infinity War,” so that leaves “Avengers 4” on the table.) Maybe, but in order for that to be so, “Avengers 4” would need to involve some sort of time travel, which, coincidentally, is the exact rumor that’s been going around. Leaked set photos support the theory that we’re going to see the surviving Avengers revisit iconic scenes from the previous movies. The pics show Ant-Man and Captain America at the battle of New York, which occurred in 2012′s “The Avengers” and did not originally feature Ant-Man. Thor’s hammer was definitely present at the battle. So if the characters do indeed fly back in time, a Thanos-vs.-Thor-and-Cap battle scene, in which Cap finally gets his hand on Mjolnir, is possible. (The thing is, ilurkthingsreborn also claimed Thanos eventually kills Cap with the hammer, adding a whole other, devastating layer to things. Is Thanos’ cause ― destroying half the life in the universe ― worthy, too? Uh, I hope not.) Of course, time travel has its problems. The Infinity Stones play a role in several different Marvel films, so a change in the stones’ timeline could potentially alter the plots of the other MCU movies that already exist, like “Guardians of the Galaxy.”  As an alternative to straight-up time traveling, some fans have suggested the Avengers could journey into the past using alternate realities connected to the Quantum Realm, a concept we first learned about in “Ant-Man.” This is another dimension where space and time are irrelevant, which you access through magical energy ― or by turning subatomic, like Ant-Man does. The Quantum Realm would explain why “Ant-Man and the Wasp” and “Captain Marvel,” both movies that supposedly use the realm in some capacity, are set to come out before “Avengers 4.” They might establish more ground rules for the final “Avengers” installment.  Heavier use of this other realm could also explain why Sebastian Stan (who plays Bucky Barnes) has talked about acting in a scene with Michelle Pfeiffer in the MCU. (The actress is set to play Janet Van Dyne in “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” a character thought to be lost forever in the Quantum Realm. And Bucky, aka the Winter Soldier, turned to ash in “Infinity War.”) Some reality altering has to happen here. On a recent episode of the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast, the Russo brothers told host Josh Horowitz that the upcoming “Avengers” movie is mostly filmed but could change a lot in editing. So, who knows what we’ll actually see in the end! But these leaks could be somewhat of a road map for those hoping not to turn to ash before the next movie comes out. Here are a few other theories on the fate of “Avengers 4”:  Was Ant-Man secretly in the previous “Avengers” movies, just miniaturized and pulling strings in the background? Well, according to the supposedly leaked photos, he was/will be?  If part of the new movie revolves around retrieving the Infinity Stones before Thanos does, an Avenger will have to obtain the Soul Stone. And in order to do that, they’ll have to kill someone they love. So far, the internet is betting Iron Man will sacrifice Captain America. Do they actually love each other right now, though?  It seems more likely, to me at least, that Black Widow will have to sacrifice Hulk (or vice versa) and that’s the reason the movies have focused on their potential romance so much. (Ilurkthingsreborn suggested Iron Man will sacrifice Pepper Potts, but that seems a little too dark.) The leaks said it’ll be Hulk, but I’d put my money on Captain America. In an interview with “Infinity War” writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, they said the goal for “Infinity War” is to put Cap, a former sickly, scrawny kid, in the most unbelievable situation imaginable. What would be more unbelievable than that same kid, all grown up, using a gauntlet that’s powerful enough to destroy half the universe? That or using a weapon in place of the god of thunder. Either choice sounds pretty worthy."
ARTS & CULTURE,"If only we’d all just listened to Margaret Atwood. The acclaimed author of The Handmaid’s Tale has been acting as something of a political sage recently. Thanks in part to an upcoming, timely Hulu adaptation of her dystopian classic about a woman forced to act as a breeder for a powerful, childless couple, many have found the book’s depiction of a theocratic totalitarian state to be painfully relevant commentary on this political moment. A woman’s right to control her own body isn’t Atwood’s only political hobbyhorse. An interview published by the CBC shows that as far back as 1981, she was arguing powerfully for the primacy of art and culture in defining a nation.  Asked by interviewer Russ Patrick whether “survival of country” is really so strongly linked to the vibrancy of a nation’s culture, she responded philosophically: “Well, what is a country?” She elaborated, ”If you think of Britain in the 19th century, you probably don’t know a lot about statistics on who had bathrooms — although that is interesting. You think of Charles Dickens and you think of George Eliot, do you not? It’s what people made. It’s the expression of the culture that lasts.” Aside from a sudden yen to know a great deal more about toilets in 1850s England, Atwood’s interview leaves us with a poignant lesson about the necessity of fostering great art: Centuries from now, our cultural achievements will be the most important way later generations will remember us. Though her words were given in a Canadian context and have now been recirculated by Canadian media, the relevance to the U.S. right now seems unmistakeable, even pointed. The unusually severe blow President Donald Trump proposed to deal to national arts and culture programs in his budget has prompted many to debate the value of a country funding artistic pursuits at all. When viewed through Atwood’s lens, the answer seems clear: Stimulating the arts and culture sector helps a nation ensure its own historical legacy. The Handmaid’s Tale also, heartbreakingly, made this point; heroine Offred’s narrative is framed by a lecture given by an academic. Many years after her memoir takes place, the all-powerful Republic of Gilead has been reduced to a handful of cultural artifacts, including her self-told story of resistance, mulled over by scholars for their authenticity and enduring meaning. The theocracy’s restrictive, censorious nature didn’t foster a wealth of culture or accurate records; in many ways, Offred had the last laugh on her oppressors by telling a tale that outlasted them. Atwood’s 1981 words in defense of celebrating culture were resurfaced by the CBC in anticipation of the public broadcaster’s battle-of-the-books program Canada Reads. At the time the interview took place, she was several years away from publishing The Handmaid’s Tale, but she did publish a book that year: Bodily Harm, her fifth novel. Safe to say that she has made her own indelible mark in literary history.

BUSINESS,"Last week I heard BBC announce the 10th anniversary of the beginning of the financial crisis. This is dated to the decision by the French bank BNP Paribas to prohibit withdrawals from two hedge funds that were heavily invested in subprime mortgage backed securities. According to BBC, this was when lending began to freeze and house prices began to fall. The problem with BBC’s story is that house prices had already been falling for more than a year. While the nationwide decline was still relatively modest, around four percent, the drop in many of the most active markets was more than 10 percent. This was the reason that the mortgage backed securities in the Paribas hedge funds had plunged in value. When people bought homes with zero or near zero down, and the price dropped by 10 percent (and was falling rapidly), the mortgages suddenly did not look like very good investments. While some people may try to make good on a mortgage that exceeded the value of their home, many others would simply walk away. This was especially likely when the mortgage was an adjustable rate mortgage that was due to reset to a much higher interest rate in the next year or two. This timing matters because the financial crisis was first and foremost the story of the housing bubble. If mortgage debt had not been tied to an asset that was hugely over-valued, there would not have been a crisis shaking the financial system. This is true even if we recognize the corruption of the financial sector and the number of people who were dealing in complex financial instruments they did not understand. It is understandable that economists and economic reporters would like to turn attention away from the housing bubble since it was easy to see for anyone paying attention at the time. The country had an unprecedented nationwide run-up in house prices, as house sale prices rose far faster than the overall rate of inflation across most of the country. This was a break with the usual pattern where nationwide house prices just tracked inflation. This should have set off alarm bells, not only because the run-up was extraordinary, but because there was no remotely corresponding change in rents. The rental indexes barely outpaced the rate of inflation in these years. Also, even as house sale prices were going through the roof, the vacancy rate for housing was reaching record levels. The fact that houses were being purchased with dubious loans was also hardly a secret. It was common to refer to “NINJA” loans, which stood for no income, no job, and no assets. Banks were happy to make loans to anyone who would take them since they knew they could resell these loans almost immediately in the secondary market. A survey by the National Association of Realtors found that 43 percent of first-time buyers in 2005 had a down payment of zero or less on their mortgage. The “or less” refers to the fact that some homebuyers actually borrowed more than the sale price in order to get money to cover closing costs, renovations, or moving expenses. The housing bubble was also the story of the Great Recession. The housing bubble was driving the economy in the years leading up to the crash. Soaring house prices lead to an unprecedented boom in construction, which peaked at just under 6.5 percent of GDP. This would be more than 1.2 trillion annually in today’s economy. After the crash, the glut of housing led construction to fall to less than 2.0 percent of GDP. Anyone have a quick way to fill a demand gap of $800 billion a year? But it was actually worse than this. Soaring house prices led to an unprecedented consumption boom as people spent against the bubble generated equity in their homes. When prices came back down to earth and the equity disappeared, people cut back their spending accordingly. We lost the equivalent of more than $500 billion in annual demand due to the fall in consumption in the wake of the crash. In all, we were looking at a demand gap on the order of 7-8 percentage points of GDP, or $1.4 to $1.6 trillion in today’s economy. The Obama stimulus, which was less than 2 percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010, was helpful, but nowhere near large enough, nor did it last long enough. The result was the slow and weak recovery that we have seen. The economic disaster that cost millions of people their jobs and/or their homes, and forced tens of millions to accept lower wages, was one hundred percent avoidable if the people responsible for making economic policy had been awake. Turning the story of the housing bubble into a story about the financial crisis is an effort to make issues that are quite simple seem very complicated. This is a way to let those who are responsible off the hook, since, hey, it’s complicated. And if they have to rewrite history to make the case, well that can be done."
BUSINESS,"Swedish furniture giant Ikea wants to create jobs for Syrian refugees with its new series of handwoven rugs and textiles set to roll out in 2019.  Production of the limited line will be based in Jordan, which has accepted more than 655,000 refugees since war broke out in neighboring Syria in 2011. The project is expected to create roughly 200 jobs for refugees and locals, Jesper Brodin, a range and supply manger for Ikea, told the Financial Times. “The situation in Syria is a major tragedy of our time, and Jordan has taken a great responsibility in hosting Syrian refugees,” Brodin told CNN Money. “We decided to look into how Ikea can contribute.” The multinational corporation plans to first sell the goods in Jordan and other Middle Eastern countries that have free-trade agreements with Jordan, before possibly expanding sales into other regions. Ikea has aligned itself with a number of projects that have benefitted Syrian refugees. In January 2016, the company announced it had raised over $33 million to provide light and renewable energy sources to refugees living in camps across the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Ikea’s partnership with the U.N. to develop a safer and more durable refugee housing unit dubbed the “Better Shelter” won the company two major 2016 design awards from the Design Museum of London. Lars Petersson, Ikea’s U.S. country manager, called President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration “so troubling” in a note sent to employees on Monday. Peterson’s memo promised free legal advice to any employee affected by the controversial order, which indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees from entering the U.S. and temporarily restricts immigration from several predominantly Muslim countries. “Any proposal that would discriminate against a certain group of our customers or co-workers, or limit our ability to attract and retain diverse talent is so troubling,” Peterson wrote. “We are committed to continuing to stand for the dignity and rights of everyone.” Ikea joins several major corporations that have come out in support of refugees in the wake of Trump’s travel ban. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz announced on Sunday that the company would hire 10,000 Syrian refugees in its stores across the world over the next five years. Airbnb is providing free housing to “refugees and anyone not allowed in the U.S.,” co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky tweeted Saturday. Google also pledged Saturday to donate $2 million to a “crisis fund,” with the hope that employees would raise $2 million more, to benefit organizations that provide services to those affected by the executive order."
BUSINESS,"United Airlines is defending its right to block certain passengers over their attire after it stopped three girls in leggings from boarding a flight Sunday. The airline first responded saying it has the right to turn away passengers who aren’t properly clothed, but eventually clarified that the young women in question were subject to a more strict dress code because of the type of tickets they were holding. Shannon Watts, the founder of the anti-gun violence group Moms Demand Action, first tweeted Sunday that a United gate agent had refused to let the young female passengers on a flight to Minneapolis because their outfits were inappropriate. 1) A @united gate agent isn't letting girls in leggings get on flight from Denver to Minneapolis because spandex is not allowed? 2) She's forcing them to change or put dresses on over leggings or they can't board. Since when does @united police women's clothing? Watts described one of the three girls forced to change as a 10-year-old in gray leggings. One of the passengers’ fathers, she pointed out, was wearing shorts and allowed on the flight without question. .@united They just boarded after being forced to change or put dresses on over the top of their clothing. Is this your policy? 2) This behavior is sexist and sexualizes young girls. Not to mention that the families were mortified and inconveninced. 3) As the mother of 4 daughters who live and travel in yoga pants, I'd like to know how many boys @United has penalized for the same reason. United first responded to Watts by pointing to a company rule saying it can refuse transport to passengers “who are barefoot or not properly clothed.” @shannonrwatts In our Contract of Carriage, Rule 21, we do have the right to refuse transport for passengers who ... https://t.co/52kRVgaCyb The rule does not elaborate on the definition of proper attire, but the airline tweeted that it leaves that up to the discretion of gate agents.  In a second response to Watts ― and several other Twitter users enraged by the airline’s policy ― United said the leggings-clad passengers were “pass travelers,” or passengers traveling as relatives or dependents of a United employee, and therefore subject to a stricter dress code. @shannonrwatts (2/2) There is a dress code for pass travelers as they are representing UA when they fly. ^KP The airline sent the same explanation to several outraged people, including actress Patricia Arquette. She snapped back after the airline said all pass travelers must dress in “good taste.” @united Leggings are business attire for 10 year olds. Their business is being children. Other social media users promised United they’d show up for their next flight with the airline in the stretchy pants ― which have prompted controversy in recent years after schools moved to ban the “distracting” attire on campus. It's not going to be a pretty sight, but I'm going to wear yoga pants for my next @united flight. I'm actually flying United Airlines this afternoon. I will be wearing leggings in protest. @united your staff needs training I don't usually travel in leggings, but strongly considering them now for my @united flight on Wednesday. Meanwhile, supermodel Chrissy Teigen, who has no problem challenging companies’ double standards when it comes to women’s bodies, said she’ll skip a top altogether on her next United flight.  I have flown united before with literally no pants on. Just a top as a dress. Next time I will wear only jeans and a scarf. In response, the airline posted a statement offering more insight into the issue, and promising regular customers they can still wear leggings on flights: We care about the way we present ourselves to you, our customers, as we believe that is part of the experience on board our flights. One of the benefits of working for an airline is that our employees are able to travel the world. Even better, they can extend this privilege to a select number of what we call “pass riders.” These are relatives or friends who also receive the benefit of free or heavily discounted air travel – on our airline as well as on airlines around the world where we have mutual agreements in place for employees and pass riders. When taking advantage of this benefit, all employees and pass riders are considered representatives of United. And like most companies, we have a dress code that we ask employees and pass riders to follow. The passengers this morning were United pass riders and not in compliance with our dress code for company benefit travel. We regularly remind our employees that when they place a family member or friend on a flight for free as a standby passenger, they need to follow our dress code. To our regular customers, your leggings are welcome. This story has been updated to include a statement from the airline."
POLITICS,"Starting in 2020, nearly all new single-family homes and low-rise apartment buildings built in California must have solar power, state authorities ruled Wednesday.  The first-of-its-kind decision by the California Energy Commission puts the state on track to meet its ambitious renewable energy targets and reach its goal of turning energy-using homes into energy producers. By combining the solar panels with other requirements such as better insulation, the updated building code will make new homes net-zero electricity users. The new requirement will be official after the Energy Commission, whose members voted unanimously for the change, gains the support of the state’s Building Standards Commission. The change marks a serious shift. Currently, only 15 to 20 percent of new single-family homes built in California come installed with solar panels.  #CalEnergy's Rosenfeld Hearing Room at full capacity this morning as Commissioners consider adopting building standards that require #Solar PV starting in 2020. Listen live here: https://t.co/Nt22146JmT ⚡️ pic.twitter.com/dRMxGgvhpd There are some exceptions to the new code, which is updated every three years. Buildings ill-suited for solar, such as ones completely shaded by trees, are exempt, and homes may comply with the new code by tapping into a community solar energy system instead of having their own solar panels installed. While there is some concern that the new standard will raise the price of homes by $8,000 to $12,000 ― a serious consideration in the state’s already expensive housing market ― advocates for the carbon emissions-cutting change say it will save homeowners money in the long run.  “Between the solar array and the efficiency measures, residents will save roughly $1,000 in annual utility bills, while only paying $40 per month for the measures on a 30-year mortgage, for a net saving of $480 annually at no extra cost upfront when fully financed,” the Natural Resources Defense Council said.  The environmental costs saved are perhaps even more significant, the NRDC said. “This will prevent 700,000 metric tons of carbon pollution — the equivalent of zeroing out emissions from 115,000 cars.” "
POLITICS,"Patrick Morrisey is President Donald Trump’s new man in West Virginia. The Mountain State Republican won a heated primary on Tuesday, defeating U.S. Rep.

In a victory speech, Morrisey said that “for too long the Washington elites have looked down on West Virginia and our values.” “Our victory will ensure that West Virginia rises again,” he said.  Thank you West Virginia.

Blankenship was the chief executive of Massey Energy when the company’s Upper Big Branch mine exploded in 2010, killing 29 miners. President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Monday to urge voters in West Virginia to reject the former coal executive, saying Blankenship “can’t win the General Election” in November. To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can’t win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey! Responding to Trump’s tweet, Blankenship predicted on Monday that he would not only win the primary but that he would “beat Joe Manchin even without the support of the establishment.”  Instead, Morrisey will face two-term incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin, the president’s most dependable Democrat in the Senate, who cruised to an easy victory Tuesday over progressive primary challenger Paula Jean Swearengin to secure the Democratic nomination. Despite voting in favor of the White House’s agenda 61 percent of the time, the president has targeted Manchin, the lone Democratic senator in a state Trump won by 42 percentage points in 2016 and remains extremely popular.  Trump first waded into the race last month at a roundtable event on taxes in White Sulphur Springs. Standing beside Morrisey and Jenkins, he called on voters to oust Manchin. Blankenship did not receive an invitation. “We have to get more Republicans in office,” Trump said. “You’re going to have a chance to get a senator that’s going to vote our program. That’s going to help you in so many ways.” Blankenship tried to paint Jenkins and Morrisey as establishment pawns, while mainstream Republican groups poured money into the race in hopes of keeping Blankenship off the ticket. Upper Big Branch had made Blankenship the face of greed and recklessness for many West Virginians. A group with ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell aired anti-Blankenship advertisements, and McConnell prodded Trump to get involved and weigh in on behalf of Jenkins and Morrisey. Blankenship had dubbed McConnell “Cocaine Mitch” and created a firestorm when he referred to the Kentucky senator’s father-in-law as a “Chinaperson” and later defended his use of the racist term.  McConnell’s political team trolled Blankenship late Tuesday, posting a graphic of the senator in a cloud of cocaine with the words, “Thanks for playing, Don.”  Thanks for playing, @DonBlankenship. #WVSen pic.twitter.com/TV1ETgQdmu If Morrisey wins on Nov. 6, it would mark a milestone in the president’s takeover of what was once known as the bluest state in America. The state’s other senator, Shelley Capito, is a Republican who worked closely with the White House on rolling back environmental regulations to bolster coal. Last August, Gov. Jim Justice, a billionaire coal executive, announced his decision to switch parties and become a Republican at a rally with Trump. All three of the state’s U.S. representatives are Republicans. The GOP commands majorities in the state Senate and House of Delegates, and it controls five of six offices of the executive branch. But Morrisey faces a formidable opponent in Manchin. The 36-year veteran of West Virginia politics has served as governor and secretary of state and enjoys the advantage of incumbency and the biggest war chest in the race. Manchin handily defeated his primary opponent, progressive activist Paula Jean Swearengin, on Tuesday and raised nearly $6 million by last month. That’s far ahead of Morrisey’s $1.9 million. Vice President Mike Pence was among those who congratulated Morrisey on his victory. “The great people of [West Virginia] need a senator who supports the #MAGA agenda,” he posted to Twitter.  Congratulations to @MorriseyWV on his victory tonight. @RealDonaldTrump and I look forward to working with him. The great people of WV need a senator who supports the #MAGA agenda.   Dave Jamieson contributed to this report. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"A serial about two artists with incurable neurological disease sharing fear, frustration and friendship as they push to complete the most rewarding creative work of their careers.
Read Episode Thirty-Four: Finished!. Or, start at the beginning: An Illness's Introduction. Find all episodes here. After the thrill of seeing Hadley's murals on the walls of the Montana State Capital building, coming home to my novel that was growing roots in a file on my laptop was hard. The disappointment I felt in myself was directly proportional to the admiration I felt for Hadley. It was impossible not to compare our trajectories. Hadley, plagued as she'd been with serious health issues all her life, had turned out many notable projects in her 38 years, culminating in a historic, grand-scale commission. Here I was, on the verge of 60, and I hadn't managed to get Dream House, the project that most mattered to me, out into the world. I'd witnessed Hadley's deep satisfaction, unveiling the strongest and most celebrated work of her life. I wanted that! The week following my trip to Montana, I attended a rousing orchestral performance. I found myself imagining a violinist playing her instrument in her room for years on end with no clear prospect of ever being heard. An absurd notion, as music is meant to be listened to. We don't think of writing as a performing art. But like musicians, writers work assiduoaulsy to craft an affecting expression of their ideas and stories in order to touch an audience with their words. Writers, I glumly mused as the orchestra played on, can write for years without having their work read. Away doom and gloom! I couldn't let my discouragement quash my determination. I began making inquiries about self-publishing. I had no well-considered bias against this route to publication; I just didn't feel I had the stamina it takes to make it happen. No sooner had I begun my research, than an email popped up that made my heart gallop. Jay, my Dream House editor, had a colleague who was interested in publishing the book. It was tempting to get carried away by the excitement of this news. But I didn't share it even with my husband, Lewis, because the only thing worse than riding the rollercoaster of publication hopefulness that had begun four years earlier was taking those closest to me along for the ride. Two weeks after Hadley's mural unveiling, in a state of suspended belief, I drove downtown to meet with Lisa McGuinness, publisher at Yellow Pear Press. We hit it off and right then and there, nailed down details and deadlines to meet for publishing in the fall, November 2015.  Within eight weeks of my meeting with Lisa, my novel had a cover and I was proofreading the galleys. Every week, I let the new reality sink in a little more, but I still felt unable to celebrate. In part, this was because publishing had been a dream for so long that it felt too good to be true. Also, with many hands involved in its production, I fretted about whether the physical book would have the qualities I hoped for. And then there was the obvious: apprehension about how the novel would be received. Another reason I felt excitement bubbling up only at discreet moments was not related to anxieties about my novel, but rather, what was happening in my day-to-day, i.e., life, which goes on despite the alternate realities our work sometimes constructs for us. Sylvia, after a short remission, was not winning her fight with cancer. The July ablation she'd had on the small lesion on her liver appeared to trigger an inflammatory response, resulting in a new proliferation of cancer cells. By February, she was housebound, except when she needed to see her doctor, and was spending much of her days sleeping. One Saturday evening in mid-March, the water heater on the second floor of her house began leaking through the floor. The plumber who came on Monday used a blowtorch too close to a fire sprinkler in the water heater closet, setting off a monsoon in the house. Sylvia's daughter, Meredith, home at the time, called 911 and me. Then, she led her bathrobed mother down into the street and helped her and their dog into their parked car. When I arrived, there was mayhem: two fire trucks, water everywhere, my stunned, sliver of a friend sitting in the car out front. I drove her to my house and set her up in bed. Sylvia, her husband Peter, Meredith, and their Golden Retriever stayed with us for a week while their house dried out. It was profoundly affecting to witness the tender, complicated care Peter and Meredith gave Sylvia, and to have one of my dearest friends under my roof at the end of her life. When she was sleeping, I tried to carry on with the daily tasks that were moving my book forward, but my awareness of Sylvia's ephemerality kept me in the present moment. I didn't want to miss something important. I savored the times she asked me to help shift her tiny frame in the bed, each brief conversation we shared. ""I don't want to keep going like this,"" she told me one day. We talked about what's within a patient's power when they are ready to stop suffering and say goodbye. What could be more important, and yet how many times in life do we get the chance to talk this way with someone we love? One morning when we were chatting, she looked deep in thought for a few moments and I braced myself for something difficult. Finally, she said, ""I probably won't be able to eat it, but just in case, can you save me some of the Bolognese sauce you made for dinner?"" She laughed. She was such a foodie. She'd been eating Gerber baby arrowroot biscuits, mashed potatoes and ground chicken for days; no wonder she craved some zest! That week, I barely thought about Parkinson's, which felt like a mere annoyance. But I thought a lot about what awaits me and everyone close to me at the end of our lives. During Sylvia's stay, I talked to Hadley and she recalled her last days with her stepfather, Charlie. Our conversation about dying was disorienting, as if I were looking through a camera lens at the four of us -- Hadley, Sylvia, Charlie, and myself -- trying to adjust the focal length to correspond with our (unspoken) perceptions of where we were on the timelines of our lives. In late March, I sat on Sylvia's bed in the bright California sunshine streaming through the windows. She was waifish, every bone explicit. Always meticulously groomed, she worried aloud about how long her fingernails had grown and I asked her if she'd like me to cut them. Sylvia was a private person, and I felt honored when she said yes. As I held each of her cool, delicate fingers in my hand and clipped, I took my time, relishing the intimacy of this simple task, taking it in as Sylvia's last gift to me. She died several days later with Peter and Meredith by her side. Winter and spring were a blur of proofreading the Dream House galleys -- every word and punctuation mark, six times (by the time the book went to print, I probably could've told you to pick a word, any word, and I would've been able to turn to the page where it was written)--and pulling together promotional material at the behest of the publicist. Among other things, this included setting up an author Facebook page and a website, which I was lucky enough to have our son, Tobias, design. I learned how to describe the book in as few, hopefully enticing, phrases as possible: ""An architect of houses searching for home,"" ""...how we shape and are shaped by our houses,"" ""What makes a house feel like home?"" As tedious as the production period was at times, after years of editing Dream House with nothing but hope and encouragement to keep me motivated, I gobbled up the tasks before me, knowing that there would be a monumental payoff. Finally, I was able to put to bed all my sad feelings that are best described by the old question, ""If a tree falls in a forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?"" In July, Lisa met me for lunch to present my printed book. When she passed it across the table, I was unprepared for the emotional rush that sent me diving for my napkin to brush away tears. To me, the book was an exquisite object. The quiet but evocative jacket featuring an image of the Maine house where I was raised perfectly captures the tone and landscape of the novel; the size and weight of the book is modest but inviting. I hadn't dared to hope the physical embodiment of my story and the story itself, in which I explored everything that most moved me: space and architecture, love and motherhood, pain and healing, ocean, sky and trees, would be so well integrated, so...right. A week before the book's publishing date, in late October 2015, we threw a party. I dubbed it the ""If not now, when?"" party. I'd been casting about for an excuse to have a very big party for years and a book event seemed more fun than waiting for a milestone birthday, which, especially when you have a progressive, degenerative disease, is not necessarily a cause for celebration. The party was a blast. Local friends and my neurologist came. Friends from the other coast as well as our daughter Elena, my sisters, their husbands and some of their offspring flew in. Tobias's band played and I danced with the freewheeling women in my writing group. Lisa set up a bookselling table and friends generously stood in line to purchase books and have me sign them. While turning my Sharpie loose on book after book, it finally became real to me: my book! Did I have Parkinson's? Not that night! I spoke into a microphone for the first time in my life. I was nervous, since presenting to groups has never been easy for me, but being in that crowd of well-wishers was like soaking in a warm bath.

From November through April, I talked about Dream House in the west and in New England at bookstores, private parties, newspaper and radio interviews, seven book groups and an architecture school. Awesome family and friends from around the country facilitated opportunities for me to speak and sell books. Mindful of my energy's ebb and flow, I only scheduled events where I knew people who would fill the chairs.

I never stopped feeling nervous when approaching the podium, afraid I'd go blank in the middle of a thought. I did a couple of times, but managed to recover well enough. After describing the inspirations for the novel, I would read a couple of passages and feel my anxiety drop away. Speaking the words I'd written, I re-experienced the passion I'd felt when I started the book years ago. It was powerful to feel I was engaging my listeners' emotions and imagination, not by selling plot or drama but simply through my choice and arrangement of words. Finally, I was out of my room, playing my music. People were listening.

I didn't push much beyond my limitations to publicize Dream House, so the post-publication experience was entirely positive. Even at the event in my hometown, 3000 miles away, where I feared God-knows-who would surface to scold me with a wagging finger for airing my family's troubles, people were warm, inquisitive and even a little proud of their homie author. In addition to old family friends I hadn't seen in decades, two of my first childhood girlfriends were in that room, as well as my first love; their presence added a distracting tenderness to the occasion. Everywhere I went, I filled with gratitude for people's inquisitiveness, enthusiasm, and their persistent pursuit of literature. That Lewis was the best roadie ever made all the difference. It was as if he'd read a manual on how to support your Parkie wife while she's on a book tour. He hefted my carryon into the overhead bin. Took my hand in the airport when he saw my leg dragging. Schlepped boxes of books and ran peoples' credit cards at private events. While at our Airbnb, he dashed to the market for groceries, made me coffee every morning and, in the evenings before my book talks, a mini margarita to boost my confidence. (Trust me; it works.) Each day, he rode a bike for an hour and a half but insisted he wasn't too tired to go back out and take a three mile walk with me, because he knows that exercise is what keeps my body from shutting down altogether. He was excited to greet the wonderful old friends who came out of the woodwork. Throughout the ""season of Dream House,"" Lewis expressed no complaints. He had lost his partner in architecture years before, but was now proud to crow about her book to anyone who'd listen. He was thrilled for me, but also, like many partners of those with debilitating conditions, he understands the importance of turning up the light on life's joyful passages and significant accomplishments. So, how did it feel to finally be published at 60? Besides joy, another feeling: relief when I finished my book tour. Taking stock of my Parkinson's progression, I had a sense that publication came not a moment -- or at least year -- too soon. Also a relief was to be done with the story that had been parked in my brain like a giant RV full of claustrophobic family members, and to clear out my cabinet filled with paper drafts, some dating back to the late 20th century. I could move on. Parkinson's added to my life a new community of friends like Hadley with whom I can share the experience of our disease. The release of Dream House provided another avenue for making meaningful connections. Friends and total strangers have written to me about why they resonated with the novel; the territories that I'd burned to explore ignited in them vivid memories and powerful emotions. I've felt honored and delighted that they've shared, sometimes in intimate detail, tales of their complicated relationships with a house, with a parent, or their children. This -- touching the hearts and minds of my readers and in return, being moved by their stories -- was the least expected but greatest reward of realizing my long-time dream.

ARTS & CULTURE," In Seattle, last week, I looked across the intersection of Fifth Avenue and Olive Way, into McGraw Square, and towards the Westin Hotel, noting a Seattle urbanism trifecta---the Lake Union Streetcar, the skillet food truck and one building of Amazon's new headquarters complex under construction.  What's not to like about that view? Well, one thing for sure. I saw a ghost, of a missing building from a boyhood memory---something that Amazon might have retrofitted, today, if it were still there for the taking. Gone from this layered, contemporary scene was something significant to the history of Seattle, the Orpheum Theater, demolished in 1967, once the largest theater in the Pacific Northwest, and the temporary home of the Seattle Symphony.  Begun as a vaudeville house, the design, by theater architect Marcus Priteca also featured street-level retail, and offices---a reminder that mixed-use development is nothing new. I specifically remember my last trip to the Orpheum, to view the Batman movie from the original television show; notable because local actor Adam West portrayed Bruce Wayne as the winged avenger. But this is not a tale of Batman over streetcars.  Nor is this an essay about the retention of historic theaters for the preservationist's cause.  Rather, this is a manifesto about the role of purposeful observation and sensation in urban environments, and acknowledgement of the undercurrents and overlaps that form cities today. In capturing the photograph above, as an acknowledged urbanist, perhaps I should revel in the streetcar and food truck scene, with an expanded McGraw Square allowing greater pedestrian use. Instead, I hold that scene in perspective, because I'm old enough to recall what was there before. I'm also an inductive, first person urbanist, always looking for context in what I see. Amid urban change, I see ghosts of bygone images, wondering, ironically, about their unrealized role in today's vitality. This approach, allowing for and explaining the stories behind our redeveloping cities, should not be viewed as antiquarian, academic or obstructionist.  For example, similar memories of the native American trail that traveled from Elliot Bay to Seattle's Lake Union, have spurred the Seattle Parks Foundation-led ""Lake2Bay"" initiative, which endeavors to create a multifaceted urban innovation corridor. I'd like to think urban observation and collective urban memory are as important to the authenticity of urban change today as the oral histories among indigenous people who pass on cultural traditions from one generation to the next.   Photos via Lawton Gowey (left, 1967), and John Thomas (right, 1927) featured on Seattle Now and Then website, here The tool of human memory, discerning eyes and understanding both the pragmatism of the present and the symbolic, collective meaning of a given place are often left behind in today's discussions of urban solutions. Hence my past adamance, in Urbanism Without Effort and many articles, where I refer to the importance of the urban diary tool, ""place-decoding"" skills and ""reading cities cover to cover"", in holistic fashion.  I have urged urbanists to create urban diaries and to see their surroundings, to gain a real understanding of cities where we work and live. Of course, in many respects, I'm channeling those involved in the urban realm for years, both as practitioners and academics. For example, former San Francisco Planning Director and academic Allan Jacobs is perhaps best known for setting this tone in the 1980's, and Jan Gehl and Birgitte Svarre have recently summarized the value, history, and many examples of why ""studies"" of public life are essential to urban policy in How to Study Public Life. While it is increasingly possible through smartphone applications, Google Earth overlays and other tools (see, e.g. Drivedecisions) to compile surveys, aggregate data, and represent such information three dimensionally or numerically for purposes of decision-making or political debate, we often lose the most important human elements when we disallow the importance of looking at cities and their component parts, even if they are no longer there. Similarly, modern-day tool kits are lacking, in my opinion, because they often don't fully equip leaders in policy and decision-making to understand the multifaceted urban world. While we have recipes for code-drafting and repairing suburbs and sprawl, we don't have enough guides for public officials or staff to be confident in legislating many intrinsic elements of a successful urbanism, as once summarized by Jacobs (Allan, not Jane) and the late Donald Appleyard, such as deriving place from placelessness, retaining authenticity, livability, intensity, integration, diverse public spaces and ways. This is critically important, because project advocacy, both pro and con, is often based on personal perception, observation or visual simulation, stylized in support or opposition to inevitable change. As Jacobs  wrote in 1984, (in association with his book, Looking at Cities) about the value of simply observing cities and trusting what we see: ""Looking at and taking messages from urban environments should be as important a research and analytic method as any other that we choose to use, one used in conjunction with others both as a discrete research act and as a constant part of our professional and personal lives."" In the past, my own attempts to voice this perspective in book talks and on professional panels have surprised some audience members who ask why a lawyer--- trained by his profession to give pragmatic advice---is espousing the human messages of urban design, and suggesting that inductive observation and place-based memory can impact the urban environment in a practical way.  I smile and note that I am not centering on architectural style, or mimicry of a remnant historical structure or natural ecosystem.  Nor am I an environmental psychologist, or ""placemaking"" professional.  Rather, I am talking about how, in the city, human beings wrestle with nostalgia, seek continuity, and observe and face inevitable change. In particular, what purpose does remembering a now-missing theater---however intangible and historical---play in this Seattle example described here? Is there an essence, spirit, or symbol of the former use that could play a role in urban redevelopment or revitalization?  Does the ghost somehow still have game? Perhaps, honoring the story entirely missing in last week's photograph could stimulate more meaningful attention to the uniqueness of the setting and the lost uses of the area's space.  In this general locus, consider the following enhancements to place: In sum, when framing urban issues, describing cities or developing profiles of a specific place, the detailed variations in the individual perceptions of urban dwellers and observers should not be lost.  These subtle messages are often spurred by ordinary urban landscapes, icons, emblems, symbols and ""context clues"" within ready view, contributing to an understanding of why a place looks and feels like it does today, and what might now be missing but potentially renewed.

BUSINESS,"You’ve probably never heard of them, but chances are good they know plenty about you ― including things like your home address, your phone number, your sports interests and whether you’re a “dog enthusiast.” “They” are an online marketing and analytics firm by the name of Alteryx, and according to a report Tuesday by the cyber risk company UpGuard, they left a database containing sensitive information on 123 million American households unsecured and open to the public. Chris Vickery, UpGuard’s cyber risk research director, told HuffPost Tuesday he stumbled across the 36-gigabyte database during a routine search of Amazon Web Services’ storage “buckets,” which house data for various companies of all sizes. Anyone with a basic understanding of what keywords to look for and how to sift through vast amounts of data could have done the same, Vickery said. “I’m not the only person doing this,” he said. “I’m certain there are bad guys doing it as well as good guys.” As for the data itself: The file contains 123 million rows of data, one for just about every single household in the U.S. at the time of its likely creation in 2013. And each of those households is individually described via 248 specific categories. In addition to the data listed above (address, phone number, whether you’re a dog or cat person, etc.), other categories include the number of children living in the house, and their age ranges and gender; what types of magazines you subscribe to; your mortgage amount; how old your car is; which causes you donate to; your ethnicity; and plenty more. While the database doesn’t include individual names, Vickery said that’s a moot point given everything else it contains. “It gets down to a level specific enough to be dangerous, although it does not have first [and] last names,” he said. “It’s so simple to look up somebody’s name if you have their address and their phone number.” Given its personal nature, that information could be used for pretty damaging purposes, like circumventing what’s known as “knowledge-based authentication.” “When you buy a car these days, or you apply for a loan, or you’re going for a student loan with the government or something, in order to verify who you are, a lot of times you run into knowledge-based authentication,” Vickery explained. “That’s where not only do you have to provide your name, address and Social Security number, but they’ll also ask you, ‘OK, where did you live five years ago, who owns the mortgage to your house’ ― all sorts of bits of data that only you are supposed to know.” “Databases like this allow bad guys to have that information about large swaths of people,” he said. “So lots of fraud can be committed, even with systems that are designed to be based on personal knowledge.” A central component of Alteryx’s database, titled “ConsumerView,” was provided by a company you probably have heard of: Experian. Experian has a database with that exact name that Alteryx incorporates into a license it sells for $38,995 a year. Reached for comment, Experian directed HuffPost to Alteryx. Alteryx didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. “This is an Alteryx issue,” Experian said in a statement, noting that the data in question is used often in marketing. “Data security has always been, and always will be, our highest priority. As a matter of security best practices, Experian vets all our clients and mandates robust security measures and controls to secure our data.” To be clear, Experian isn’t responsible for this particular data breach, though it’s certainly not a stranger to data breaches in general. Experian supplied the data to Alteryx, and Alteryx failed to secure it. (Similarly, Alteryx likely wasn’t at fault for a separate data breach earlier this year that exposed the personal information of almost all of America’s 200 million registered voters. The database in that instance was stored as an Alteryx file type, suggesting it originated with the company, but the blame rests with the Republican data firm that left it open to the public.) Regardless of who is at fault in this particular circumstance, Vickery said all the companies that compile this type of data need to up their security game. “I’m a little disappointed that [Alteryx] would just leave it unencrypted out there for anybody, and that Experian would just give them a copy like that,” he said. “Keeping it open and in the clear is just asking for trouble.” As for the consumers affected by this breach ― which, again, is pretty much every American household ― there isn’t much we can do except push for stronger regulations on the companies that compile this type of data. “If you’re an American, your information probably was exposed,” Vickery said.  “We live in a new age,” he added. “You have to stay vigilant. You have to watch your financial accounts. You can’t just assume you’re not going to be a victim, because the bad guys have the knowledge, the information and the tools these days.” “It’s more a question of whether or not you’re lucky rather than how protective you’ve been,” he said. “Even if you’ve been very protective of your information, there’s companies like Equifax that have your data. And even though you never gave it to them, they get breached all the time.” "
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― One year ago, President Donald Trump and House Republicans gathered in the Rose Garden for a victory ceremony. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) had just shepherded through a bill repealing major parts of the Affordable Care Act, moving them a step closer to their promise of undoing President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement.  “We don’t have to talk about this unbelievable victory — wasn’t it unbelievable? So we don’t have to say it again. But it’s going to be an unbelievable victory, actually, when we get it through the Senate,” Trump boasted, standing in front of beaming House members.  Since Obamacare’s passage in 2010, Republicans had made repealing it their central campaign promise. If the country handed control of Congress and the White House to the GOP, they would finally dismantle it. In 2016, they got their wish. But they still couldn’t get the job done. The Senate never passed the House repeal legislation. Public opinion swung in favor of the law, and many of the House members who took the tough vote to advance repeal now find themselves on the defensive at home.  The uneasiness the GOP feels with Obamacare repeal is borne out by the money candidates and other groups are spending on TV ads. In the past, Republicans walloped Democrats on the air with ads mentioning Obamacare, according to an analysis by Kantar Media/CMAG for HuffPost. But in the 2018 cycle, the numbers aren’t quite as stark. Conservatives are still spending more on anti-Obamacare ads ― and airing more spots on the issue ― but Democrats aren’t nearly as far behind as in the past.  It’s not just that Republicans are less interested in talking about the issue ― it’s also that Democrats are finally feeling emboldened.  “We see health care as the defining issue of the 2018 midterms,” said David Bergstein, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “The Republican health care agenda is incredibly toxic with voters of every political persuasion.” For the first time in an election cycle since Obamacare’s passage, a majority of the public now approves of the health care law. Democrats now have a sizable advantage over the GOP on the issue, and candidates frequently bring up their support for Obamacare while meeting with voters.  Twenty-three million fewer Americans would have had insurance under legislation that the House Republicans narrowly passed, according to the Congressional Budget Office.  Even though outright repeal appears to be off the table, there are still efforts to undermine the law. The big GOP tax bill eliminated the financial penalty for people who don’t get insurance. Without that penalty in place, healthy people are less likely to buy insurance, causing premiums for those who keep insurance to rise.   At the same time, Republicans at both the state and federal levels are doing what they can to change the rules on the types of insurance available. These efforts may result in cheap but less generous plans for people in good health ― and more expensive premiums for people who want or need more comprehensive coverage, including those with pre-existing conditions.  "
ENTERTAINMENT,"Nothing can make Amy Schumer blush.  The “I Feel Pretty” actress gladly spilled tidbits about her sex life with new hubby Chris Fischer on “The Ellen Show” Wednesday during a game called “Ellen’s Burning Questions.” She ended up revealing a few details that made her mom ― who was sitting in the audience ― cover her face.  Things got off to a fairly tame start for the fill-in-the-blank game. Schumer told Ellen DeGeneres she feels pretty when she’s nude and that she’s afraid to try lots of drugs. But that didn’t last for long.  “Where’s the craziest place you’ve had sex?” DeGeneres asked. “My butt,” Schumer answered, without missing a beat.  ″[Who is] someone you would most like to do a love scene with?” the talk show host said. “Joey from the New Kids [on the Block] today,” the comedian said, before praising ― uh ―  her husband’s genitalia.  Watch the questions that made Amy’s mom go pink below:  During her time on the show, Schumer also hinted at the possibility of having kids with Fischer, whom she married in a surprise ceremony in February.  “I have never wanted kids,” she said. “And then I saw myself as a baby on your show and I thought, ‘Who am I to deprive the world of such a beautiful baby?’” The 36-year-old previously dressed up as a baby on DeGeneres’ show, and Ellen put a picture up of the comedian in costume.  “Yeah so I think we’re gonna do it but just use my genetics,” Schumer said after seeing the picture.  The comedian also reflected on life with her husband, who she says has known her for about a year. The two were living together for about five months before Fischer, who is a chef, popped the question. Just a few days ago, the newlyweds celebrated their two-month anniversary together.  A post shared by @amyschumer on Apr 13, 2018 at 3:51am PDT Schumer has spoken about how much she loves being married on her press tour for “I Feel Pretty.”  “The best part is just having a partner and being like ‘I got a team,’” Schumer said in an interview with E! News on Monday. “It was just me and [my dog] Tatiana, and now it’s cool. You got someone to go through life with together that you love and you want to be partnered up with.” "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Still from Girls Girls Girls; New Jersey Crüefest Tailgate Party, 2012 Rachel Rampleman introduced me to the NYC-based, all-ladies Mötley Crüe tribute band, Girls Girls Girls one Saturday night in early 2014 during a visit to her Brooklyn studio. The band was getting ready to play their last show at the Bowery Ballroom and I was invited to witness the final act. A friend recently called Mötley Crüe ""butt rock,"" which he told me was coined by a Seattle grunge guy in the 90s, a term I found particularly apropos. Despite that fact that I wasn't even remotely interested in Mötley Crüe, Rampleman was clearly onto something and so I was all in. Mistress Mars (aka Denise Mercedes) in San Francisco from the photo series Girls Girls Girls, 2007-2014 Rampleman brings an omnipresent eye of the observer to the Girls Girls Girls' life cycle. With the diligence of a scientist or a collector, Rampleman marks the group's performances and eccentric activities, like working the tailgate parties of the original band, spanning from 2007 when they first performed until 2014 when they broke up over artistic differences involving Jack Daniels. She also documents the nuances of the individual women in Girls Girls Girls, who have cover lives like superheroes ranging from guitar legend to broker to hair stylist. In Rampleman's video Girls Girls Girls; New Jersey Crüefest Tailgate Party (2012), the women of Girls Girls Girls bounce back-and-forth between roles of legendary bandmates, just like musicians in a non-tribute band. Their bizarre-o world parallels a peculiar moment now inert in music history -- when men got dressed up like sexy ladies with big hair and tight pants and sang some of the most misogynistic songs ever written. Rampleman observes it all, present like an invisible member of the band, the narrator, the holder of the fan space for the rockers and the audience. Though Girls Girls Girls' audience is fewer in number, they are more targeted and more committed, together keeping a vestige alive of a movement whose heyday ended over 25 years ago. Multiple terabytes of footage bring numerous idiosyncrasies to ponder, conceptually and phenomenologically. What is going on with Girls Girls Girls, a band of women who solely perform the songs of one of the most womanizing bands of all time? Off stage, these ladies face blatant sexism, racism, and ageism at every turn and yet they participate in all the above through their reenactments. There's a schizophrenia to the highs and lows the women experience -- from their personal connections to countless strangers through super fandom and their own star quality, to the dismissive rejection by fans who discard their flyers into piles of refuse in parking lots. They endure and subject themselves to the same conversations over and over, just like the same songs over and over. One Girls Girls Girls fan said in a Village Voice article about tribute bands, ""Having young girls cover fuckin' old men is awesome."" But why is that awesome? Rampleman delves into the fuzzy contradictions of Girls Girls Girls in a quite enthralling and, at first glance, subtly feminist exploration under a surface of a behind-the-scenes, reality TV aesthetic.
Pittsburgh, PA, Landscape Near RPM's Venue from the photo series Girls Girls Girls, 2008 Studying Girls Girls Girls with the eye of an art director and a fan, Rampleman shapes the intricacies, nuanced manners and wow factors of each performer over myriad hours of on-the-road and snapshot footage. Instead of editing the video into feature length-films, Rampleman focuses on a shared passion and repossession of a thankfully bygone moment by those whom the original band idealized and marginalized, finding ownership of a movement that held her gender below a glass ceiling. What does it mean to love something that excludes you? Not unlike other marginalized populations who take on a powerful stance repossessing language, Girls Girls Girls take on the hair metal movement's brags of all the women they went through like sweaty t-shirts tossed after a show by diving deeper into a love of the atmosphere of freedom, limitlessness and forever-youngness that came with that machismo. As an outsider, it's a little bewildering and bizarre to witness that love of the oppressive hair-metal movement, smelling oddly like Stockholm syndrome, but it is clear that all involved wholeheartedly participate, revealing something powerful beyond the underlying ostracizing message of the lyrics.
New York, NY, Robin (Vixen Neil) and Patty (Nikita Seis) Watch Tommy Lee of the Original Mötley Crüe DJ at Rebel from the photo series Girls Girls Girls, 2007 I found myself out of place, being unfamiliar with the original band, and enthralled by the female performers and their audience at every beat. These women are rock stars. They deliver charisma, armed with an endless ability to slam drinks. The lead singer, Vixen Neil (aka Robin Goodwin,) brings a voice that doesn't quit. The back-up singers dance with more enthusiasm than the original Crüe back up singers; after all they are super fans. The guitarist, Mistress Mars (aka Denise Mercedes), drips in gold and studded necklaces like chains on her motorcycle pants. Mercedes played with The Stimulators at Max's and CBGB's and has been rocking since 1978, a moment many Crüe fans were born. She mesmerized me in the way only a skilled master can. These musicians have decades of rocking and performing under their collective belts. The womanizing men are relegated to relic status as Girls Girls Girls come together to ""pay tribute"" to a rebellious spirit through the most male-chauvinistic band in hair metal history. Maybe that's the ultimate rebellion, rendering misogyny toothless and transformed into girl power. I walked away awed by Girls Girls Girls' commitment and ability to put on a powerful show, but couldn't escape the nagging reality that those songs belittle women and humanity. Through Rampleman's eye, I find a deeper appreciation for what Girls Girls Girls achieve: transforming those demeaning songs into a wearable style, put on to access a boundless spirit and a love of reclaiming a moment. The re-appropriated use of language is the power and magic of it.

POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal will weaken U.S. relationships around the world and create problems that U.S. foreign policy will be grappling with for years, but it’s also a boon for the U.S. rival that American intelligence said helped Trump get elected: Russia. Trump’s move will likely lead toward progress on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s two chief goals: splintering the U.S.-led alliance of democratic powers that currently dominates global affairs and fortifying Russia’s alternative network, which includes Iran and its partners across the Middle East. A split between the U.S. and its three most powerful allies — France, Germany and the U.K. — was clear immediately after Trump’s announcement. The leaders of the latter three countries issued a joint statement expressing “regret and concern” and saying they want to sustain the Iran agreement, which promised Iran some freedom from international sanctions in exchange for limits on and guarantees of transparency about its nuclear development. They reiterated what Trump’s own military advisers and new secretary of state have said: Iran is abiding by the deal.  “America moves further away from our key allies, which has implications that are extremely important and detrimental,” said Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.), a prominent member of the House Armed Services Committee. The U.S. committed to the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, Germany, France, Russia, China and the U.K. All the other countries plan to stay in the accord. The U.S. and Europe have always had disputes. But the worry is that something fundamental is shifting.  Trump’s reneging on past U.S. commitments on Iran and climate change, along with his willingness to wage a trade war with Europe and continuously misrepresent NATO, has made it hard for America’s foreign partners to think he truly sees them as friends.  That the president made his Tuesday announcement despite warnings from his own party’s top national security voices and independent experts reminds other countries that they can’t assume that U.S. supporters of traditional diplomacy and international norms will be able to keep American relationships on track. The implicit promise of an experienced, largely bureaucratic foreign service is that it brings professionalism and longterm thinking to whatever policy an elected official wants to pursue ― and on Tuesday, U.S. diplomats didn’t even have a plan for next steps after Trump’s speech. The Europeans would prefer that the U.S. continue to operate as it traditionally did, said Federiga Bindi, a former official in the Italian government and a senior fellow at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies. “I think with [the Iran deal announcement] they start to see who Trump really is. The U.S. is never going to recover from that.” The Trump administration did try to soften the blow of the announcement. The president spoke of developing future Iran policy alongside foreign partners. And a White House statement said foreign companies that began work in Iran under the terms of the accord ― including some huge European firms ― would have a grace period to exit before potentially being hit with U.S. sanctions that Trump wants to reapply. But that only underscored how U.S. priorities now diverge from those of its longtime allies. European leaders are committed to the Iran deal because they believe it prevents the spread of nuclear weapons and they know Iran will not stay in unless it receives some economic benefit. So now those same leaders, Bindi said, must try to shield their companies from U.S. sanctions by, for instance, helping them create ways to do business in Iran that can’t be disturbed by American regulators. But there’s only so much time in the day. It’s unlikely that European officials will focus much on trying to craft the “better deal” Trump pledged, particularly because the president didn’t seem to care about the months of work they and their American counterparts put into negotiations for side agreements that he had suggested might help convince him to stay in the deal. Meanwhile, in Moscow, Putin began his fourth term in office this week with a chance to show that unlike the U.S., Russia does abide by international promises like the Iran agreement. The accord was useful for Russia because it wanted to avoid more countries gaining nuclear weapons and thereby making one of its own assets less valuable. “It never really was comfortable with Iran’s potential for breakout,” said Michael Stephens of the Royal United Services Institute in London. But a world in which U.S. credibility is in the gutter and the deal is in tatters is hardly a nightmare scenario for Putin. As the U.S. puts more economic pressure on Iran, the Islamic republic will find it harder to acquire friends. That leaves Tehran with Moscow. Though the two are uneasy partners, they have cooperated to combat international initiatives that might challenge their own interests. In Syria, for instance, they fight side-by-side and present a united front in global organizations to defend their mutual friend Syrian President Bashar Assad.  Hard-liners in Tehran want to deepen that relationship. In the process, they seek to boost the sense of righteous resistance to the West that keeps aggressive nationalism strong among their base and ensure that their country remains a Putin-style autocratic society, rather than gaining more exposure to the Western liberties that many ordinary Iranians have clamored for. A more isolated and paranoid Iran means “the Russians gain geostrategically,” said Reza Marashi, the research director at the National Iranian American Council and a former State Department official. The United States, he added, is helping reinforce a perception that the Russians want to strengthen: that today Washington may hold sway in the southern half of the Middle East, but the north ― including key areas in Syria, Iraq, Iran and Turkey ― is under Moscow’s influence. And that plays precisely into what Putin deeply desires ― to make Russia, 27 years after the fall of the Soviet Union, once again look like an equal to the U.S."
ENTERTAINMENT,"The White House just got a whole lot friendlier.  Jennifer Aniston has been tapped to star in Netflix’s new political comedy “First Ladies” as the president of the United States. “One Mississippi” actress Tig Notaro will be playing her wife. The film follows America’s first female president, the fictional Beverly Nicholson, and her wife, Kasey, as they move into the White House and prove that “behind every great woman... is another great woman,” the official description says.  The streaming service picked up the film based on an original pitch by Notaro and her wife, Stephanie Allynne, who will write the script together. Aniston is slated to produce the project alongside Notaro, Allynne, Adam McKay, Will Ferrell, Jessica Elbaum and Betsy Koch for Gloria Sanchez Productions. Chris Henchy will executive produce. Aniston, who made her name on network TV, is also set to star with Reese Witherspoon in a currently untitled show about the behind-the-scenes action of competing morning shows. In November, Apple landed the rights to the series, which has no premiere date yet.  Notaro, meanwhile, is a free agent since Amazon gave “One Mississippi” the ax after two seasons. Her original comedy special “Happy to Be Here” debuts May 22 on Netflix."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Actor/artist Jim Carrey is taking on President Donald Trump yet again, this time portraying him as Batman’s nemesis, the Joker.  The new portrait describes an agreement with the United States under Trump as “worthless,” a likely reference to the president withdrawing from the Iran nuclear treaty earlier this week. Here’s the image, with Trump getting made over in the style of Heath Ledger’s chilling version of the supervillain: Scam-a-gram ;^P pic.twitter.com/9VqAzfW1fX The white letters in the portrait spell out SEITAAGNNRUS, which astute Twitter users decoded as “RUSSIAN AGENT.”  Carrey knows a thing or two about Batman villains: He portrayed The Riddler in 1995′s “Batman Forever.”  Carrey has painted Trump several times in recent months, including an image that features his controversial former physician, Dr. Harold Bornstein: Hippocratic oaf ;^P pic.twitter.com/sbCsnTkdVH Carrey has also depicted Trump as the “Wicked Witch of the West Wing”:   If you liked my last cartoon you may also enjoy...""THE WICKED WITCH OF THE WEST WING AND PUTIN’S FLYING MONKEYS“ pic.twitter.com/slBG7j1s8d He mockingly submitted a painting of Trump to the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery:  Dear Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery @NPG, I know it’s early but I’d like to submit this as the official portrait of our 45th President, Donald J. Trump. It’s called, 'You Scream. I Scream. Will We Ever Stop Screaming?' pic.twitter.com/LrCmlXXpv7 And he depicted Trump bathing in political sewage:    Did anyone watch 60 minutes last night? Hell of a piece about a poor kid from Greece named Giannis Antetokounmpo who’s making it big in the NBA. America still has some magic. Pity you have to wade through so much cultural sewage to find it. ;^} pic.twitter.com/H4BTPcw8bu"
BUSINESS,"If your New Year’s resolution includes a financial tune-up, then you’re probably about to pull your “free” credit report. You’ll want to read this first. No, this isn’t a warning about the credit report scams that litter the internet. You know, the ones that try to convert you to a pricey service after an initial trial period. I’ll defer to our friends at the Federal Trade Commission for the details on that particular ripoff. This is about the supposedly real deal, the report you can get by visiting Annualcreditreport.com. Related: Insider contacts for the three major credit reporting agencies. When words like “free” get tossed around this much, you’re bound to run into disappointments, and the information you’ll extract from the three credit reporting agencies ― Equifax, Experian and TransUnion ― is no exception. The numbers can be difficult to access, hard to understand and incomplete. I know, because I just tried to access my own credit reports. Credit reporting agencies aren’t sending you the report because they want to. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires these agencies send you the reports during any 12-month period, upon request “and without charge.” But they don’t have to make it easy ― and they don’t. You may not be able to immediately access your information In order to verify your identity, the credit reporting agencies will ask you a series of questions. For two of the agencies, I passed the test (with some difficulty) but one of them refused to issue the report. Instead, it mailed a letter to my address with a secure link. That makes some sense, except for one small thing. The questions asked by the agency were unanswerable. They asked me to choose between several recent car purchases, none of which I had made. It’s confusing “At first glance a credit report can seem overwhelming,” says Ian Atkins, an analyst for Fit Small Business. “If you’ve been using credit for more than a couple years a credit report can easily run to 20 pages or more.” Don’t be put off. A lot of the information is redundant, showing the same type of information over and over again for each account you have. If you check your report regularly, you’ll learn to skip the repeat information. There’s no score That’s right, the most important part of the credit report ― your score ― is missing. “While these companies will provide each individual with their personal credit report at no charge, the credit score, which is derived from the credit report, is only available for a one-time fee, usually around $8 for each company,” says Josh Alpert, founder and president of Alpert Retirement Advising in Southfield, Mich. Why do they charge for the score? Because they can. Other information is missing For example, your credit report doesn’t include anything you defaulted on 10 years ago or more. You won’t find the interest rates you pay on your loans. Nor will there be any references to your race, gender or religion, or information about your political affiliations, criminal records, medical records, and marital status. That’s a lot of missing information, says Salwa Ebrahim, a spokeswoman for Cherry Creek Mortgage Company in Tempe, Ariz. “You have to know what to look for,” she says. Someone is watching Another potential shocker: A long list of “soft” inquiries of entities who pull your report for a variety of reasons. “Don’t panic,” says Kristen McGrath, financial expert at CreditCardForum. “Not all these inquiries are affecting your score. Banks pull your credit all the time to prequalify you for offers, and all the free credit-scoring sites you signed up for will as well.” The ones that don’t lower your score use language like “promotional inquiries” and “inquiries shared only with you.” The score-lowering “hard” inquiries will be labeled as “regular inquiries” or “inquiries shared with others.” If the soft inquiries bother you, you can do something to block lenders from soft-pulling your credit for pre-approvals at OptOutPrescreen.com. So how did my credit report turn out? Fairly undramatic. I was disappointed to not see my credit score, and like many consumers, I found it difficult to initially understand some of the agency terminology. But then, I’m one of the most financially boring people you’ll ever meet. I’ve lived debt-free for more than a decade, and frankly, my credit score doesn’t matter because I never ask for credit. But I’m unhappy that the credit reporting agencies don’t tell people what they really want to know ― their score. It’s a little bit like going to school but then not receiving a report card at the end of the year. Or, as Robert Siciliano, CEO of IDTheftSecurity.com, notes, it’s like going to the doctor without getting a diagnosis. “A credit report without a credit score is insufficient,” he says. You can improvise. Experts say you can estimate your credit score at no charge using FICO scores estimator, based on the information you pull from your credit report. In the end, my bank generously allowed me to view my FICO score without charging me. If you must know, my scores are about average. Something is wrong ― very wrong ― about the way credit scores are collected and dispersed. My credit report should be available to me jargon-free, without taking an impossible multiple-choice test. If I earn a credit score, shouldn’t I have the right to know what the grade is without forking over more money? And shouldn’t I also be able to see who’s checking my score in real-time, without being charged again, rather than waiting until after 12 months has elapsed? Of course. But then, the credit reports were not written for you and, if there were no federal law, the credit reporting agencies wouldn’t fork over a bit of the data without you having to pay for it. It’s not our system. We’re just a product to be graded. Something they won’t tell you when you ask for your “free” credit report ― but they probably should.

BUSINESS,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc have both approached Twenty-First Century Fox Inc to express interest in buying Fox assets that were the subject of recent talks between Fox and Walt Disney Co, two people familiar with the situation told Reuters on Thursday. News of the approaches came the same day the U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted to end a 42-year-old restriction on ownership of multiple TV stations in a major market, removing a major roadblock to media company mergers. It is unclear whether Fox’s broadcast assets are part of any of the conversations. Fox shares jumped nearly 8 percent in after-hours trading. Shares of Viacom Inc and CBS Corp also rose more than 2 percent, a sign investors may see then as potential targets. Disney was in talks to buy Fox’s movie and TV production studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic and international assets such as the Star network in India and European pay TV provider Sky Plc , CNBC reported last week. The assets would give Comcast, the largest cable provider in the United States which bought NBCUniversal in 2011, an international distribution footprint. For Verizon, the U.S. No. 1 wireless carrier, it would provide movies and TV shows to stream to its mobile subscribers. Comcast and Verizon declined comment. Fox did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

POLITICS,"Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Thomas Homan will retire from government service, he announced Monday, after spending the last 14 months serving as the most controversial deportation chief in the agency’s brief history.  “It has been the honor of my life to lead the men and women of ICE for more than a year,” Homan said in a statement. “The decision to leave federal service after more than 34 years is bittersweet, but my family has sacrificed a lot in order for me to serve and it’s time for me to focus on them.” Widely respected by law enforcement officials, but reviled among immigrant rights groups, Homan was plucked from retirement last January to lead President Donald Trump’s controversial deportation crackdown.  Homan had initially filled the position on an interim basis last year while the White House looked for a formal nominee, an ICE official said Monday. Though the White House nominated Homan to the position in November, he informed the Department of Homeland Security early this year that he intended to step down because of family considerations, according to the official. Homan told HuffPost earlier this month that his family had received threats since he took charge of the agency. But Homan had also recoiled at the notion of passing through a politically contentious Senate confirmation hearing, according to the The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news. Despite receiving the nomination to head ICE six months ago, Homan’s confirmation hearing had yet to be scheduled. A group of 17 mostly Democratic senators penned a letter Friday pressing DHS to cough up documents it had given to the Senate’s Homeland Security Committee and questioned whether he should continue to head the agency after 14 months without confirmation.  “The absence of a Senate-confirmed head of ICE for more than a year hinders Congressional oversight and the efficient operation of the agency and is troubling in any circumstance,” the letter said. “We understand that the Trump Administration may be concerned about Mr. Homan answering questions under oath about his leadership of ICE, as well as the possibility that Mr. Homan’s nomination could be defeated in the Senate.” The Senators went on to accuse Homan of carrying out “radical – and in some cases possibly illegal – changes in immigration enforcement policies and practices.” The cited the separation of hundreds of undocumented children from asylum-seeking parents after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, reversing the presumptive release of pregnant women from immigrant detention, and discarding a decades-long policy of halting deportations for individuals at the request of Congress. Those changes were “accompanied by inflammatory and inaccurate statements,” the letter said, noting Homan’s alleged use of the derogatory epithet “tonk” to refer to unauthorized immigrants, which HuffPost first reported in a lengthy profile earlier this month. The term is a Border Patrol slang that derives from the sound of bashing an immigrant over the head with a metal flashlight. (Homan denied using the term.) In an administration bogged down by infighting and high turnover, Homan had appeared to easily win Trump’s confidence, pressing ahead with the White House’s deportation agenda enthusiastically, despite the political blowback. But Homan’s abrupt departure leaves the signature agency charged with Trump’s deportation efforts leaderless and without a clear successor. “Everyone is surprised,” a former DHS official told HuffPost. “ICE has never had a deep bench and over the last year and a half it’s become increasingly weak. I would hope they’re looking outside the agency for someone with fresh ideas.” Homan had also recently complained to co-workers that he’d been increasingly marginalized by DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who left him out of negotiations with lawmakers on immigration reform earlier this year, according to The Washington Post.   But as recently as Jan. 24 of this year, Homan told the radio show John and Ken on Demand that he planned to move forward with confirmation.   “There’s a lot of paperwork involved,” Homan said at the time. “We’re on the finishing touches.” Monday’s announcement brings to a close a three-decade career in law enforcement that began when Homan joined the police department of the 2,000-person village of West Carthage in upstate New York. After serving four years as a Border Patrol agent in the 1980s, Homan steadily rose through the ranks of immigration enforcement, first as an investigator with the now defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service, and later as an administrator with ICE, which was created in 2003. Homan’s background in the rank-and-file brought with it an uniquely detailed understanding of all aspects of immigration enforcement and his tenure was characterized by a glorification of the deportation officers whom he views as unfairly vilified by legal groups and the national news media. Even among critics of Trump’s immigration crackdown, Homan himself has remained widely respected among current and former DHS officials. But he also brought a uniquely combative attitude to a position that has traditionally been filled by lawyers who shy away from making contentious statements about immigration enforcement ― one of the country’s most divisive political issues. Homan earned the ire of both immigrant rights groups and Democratic politicians by asserting that, under his watch, unauthorized immigrants “should look over your shoulder, and you need to be worried.” In perhaps his most bombastic statement, Homan in an appearance on Fox News urged the Justice Department to consider prosecuting local officials who embrace “sanctuary” policies that limit local cooperation with ICE. Even as he prepared to exit government service, Homan remained a booster of his deportation officers and took a jab at the national press. “I am humbled and inspired by the 20,000 American patriots who serve this agency and protect our nation, increasingly in the face of unfair and false criticism from politicians and the media,” Homan said in Monday’s statement. “Because of their tremendous dedication and hard work, we have made significant progress this past year in enforcing our nation’s immigration and customs laws, and in protecting public safety and national security. I will continue to be a strong advocate for the workforce and for the ICE mission.”"
ENTERTAINMENT,"In 1973, William Friedkin released “The Exorcist,” one of the highest-grossing and most applauded horror movies in history. In 2018, William Friedkin released “The Devil and Father Amorth,” a documentary about exorcisms. The movie landscape has drastically changed in the intervening years, but William Friedkin hasn’t. He is still a dazzling raconteur. His most recent fiction features, “Bug” (2006) and “Killer Joe” (2011), boast the same moody panache seen in the movies that launched his career, including “The Boys in the Band” (1970), “The French Connection” (1971), “The Exorcist,” “Sorcerer” (1977) and “To Live and Die in L.A.” (1985). And, at 82, he has aged into your overly nostalgic and slightly regressive great-uncle. He rails against the changes in American popular culture ― sometimes with good reason ― and carps about the whole “diversity” thing that’s hit Hollywood in recent years.  For an hour on a recent Thursday afternoon, I sat with Friedkin in his room at Manhattan’s swanky Carlyle Hotel, where the Oscar-winning director wore slippers, green pajama pants and a T-shirt with a dog on it. In “The Devil and Father Amorth” (now in theaters and available on select streaming platforms), Friedkin travels to Italy to profile one of the world’s leading exorcists as he treats a woman apparently possessed by demonic forces. The movie presents footage of this woman’s exorcism as fact, which led to a conversation about the reliability of documentary filmmaking, the role evil plays in the world, Friedkin’s views on the state of movies today, and the more socially conscious culture we now live in.  You’re hardly prolific these days. I have a very active travel and social life. And I’m writing a script now that I hope to finish in a couple of months that I worked on for a long time that I hope to film next. But I can’t talk about the subject, because if it gets into print it will give other people ideas, which I hope not to do. You aren’t bit by as much of a moviemaking bug as you once were, perhaps? Well, when I started out, it was a different kind of zeitgeist. And the stuff that’s being done today is not of strong interest to me: superhero movies, which is what the studios have put most of their resources behind. It is the new zeitgeist. I wouldn’t even begin to know how to begin to make one of those films. There are also some very good films that are independent that come out occasionally, but it’s very tough for them. It wasn’t when I started. You had people like John Cassavetes and other great filmmakers who would mortgage their house to make a film. They made interesting, unusual and very personal films. I don’t know if they would publish “The Great Gatsby” today, or William Faulkner. I just don’t know. It’s a different zeitgeist. The paintings aren’t the same, the music is not the same, certainly not the popular music of my day. When did you first notice that zeitgeist change? It changes constantly. It changed with “Star Wars” in the ’70s. The zeitgeist changed when the silent movies were replaced by sound. [Charlie] Chaplin and [D.W.] Griffith were largely the inspiration for American films. Then I think the next big change was probably “Citizen Kane,” where a story like that, really utilizing sound on film, changed everything. The complexity and yet the simplicity. And then the next change was in 1960 with the French film “Breathless” by Jean-Luc Godard. They’re still shooting films somewhat like that: hand-held cameras, jump cuts. Now it’s changed in American cinema to superhero films, for the most part. That’s what they’re interested in: the next blockbuster. Everyone is trying to replicate “Star Wars,” its success. I don’t know that these same people would have been comfortable in the early days making films, because they were not about superheroes. They were more complex, deeper and darker films. The difference with “Star Wars,” though, is that it was fundamentally an original story when it first opened. It took inspiration from Flash Gordon and whatnot, but nobody had seen anything like “Star Wars” before. We used to see it every Saturday afternoon as kids going to eight little pictures at a time for a quarter. There were Buck Rogers and that whole school of dumb science fiction. OK, but it wasn’t “Avengers 12” or “Transformers 16.” No, but they were making sequels and serials to that stuff all the time. They just didn’t have the tools. And George Lucas didn’t have the tools that they have now, but he did very well with that he had. That’s why the car chase in “The French Connection” is so famous. It looks handmade.  Well, there was no other way to do it. There were no computer-generated images then. We had to do everything that you saw. Do you think filmmakers are drunk on the power of visual effects? I don’t know that I would go that far. I would use it if I had to. It’s a tool. It can take you to places where you could never before even think about putting a camera. It can take you inside the Taj Mahal or the Louvre or the Vatican, and convincingly. There have been a lot of really good chase scenes that have used it. The “Bourne” films used computer imagery, and they’re good chase scenes. What do you like right now? Whom do you respect as a filmmaker? I just did a podcast with Guillermo del Toro. He’s someone who uses effects in a purposeful and profound way.  I agree. He’s a very serious filmmaker. He studied with Dick Smith, who did the makeup for “The Exorcist,” “The Godfather” and a lot of other great films. He is a really interesting filmmaker. I like Damien Chazelle, the two films I’ve seen of his. I like Wes Anderson’s films. I enjoy them a lot. And Tarantino, who has really created a niche for himself. You and del Toro talked on that podcast about how much you both love old MGM musicals. I’m sort of extrapolating here, but you implied a few years ago that the birth of rock ’n’ roll and the changes popular music went through as a result contributed to the downfall of the classical musical.  I think that’s close enough because rock music was a revolution. Elvis was a revolution. And he made some movies, but they’re not really musicals. They’re shots of Elvis performing. The popular music that gave birth to the MGM musicals were written by people like Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Sammy Cahn, Rodgers and Hammerstein. They were influenced by the popular music of the day, which was largely love songs. The popular music gradually evolved into rap and hip-hop, which is not about that, generally. And they’re not necessarily singable or danceable, certainly not by people like Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse. But hip-hop has yielded its own genre of dance, and it’s powerful too. I haven’t seen any films about hip-hop that are as exciting as “The Band Wagon” or “Singin’ in the Rain” or “Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.” Those and many other films drew on the popular music of the day. So you liked “La La Land”? I thought it was well-done. [Chazelle] did a very decent homage to the old musical. He’s such a wonderful filmmaker. And I loved the other film of his I saw, “Whiplash.” It’s terrific. Have you tried to get more movies off the ground in recent years? Not really. I haven’t found anything since “Killer Joe” that has really compelled me. Are people sending you scripts? Yes, but it’s not about scripts. It’s about what you really want to give your life to. You know, I had no script for “The French Connection,” but I loved the story. I thought the story was great. We made it up as we went along, but the guy who was the last writer on it won the Academy Award for best screenplay. How’d you make sense of that? When they fall in love with a film at the Academy, they generally fall in love with all of its parts. But I’m telling you we improvised that film every day on the set. Not one word of the chase was ever written. It’s not in any script. I went to those locations and I was inspired by them to do something that I had not seen. Who did you consider your contemporaries? Francis Coppola and Peter Bogdanovich. Bogdanovich is someone who’s made a few movies lately that no one has paid attention to. Well, that’s for a variety of reasons. The distribution platforms aren’t the same anymore. Most films are not made for a theater. They’re made for Netflix and for video on demand. The films that are made for theaters are the superhero films for large audiences, and some of the horror films recently, which I think are very good. “Get Out” and “A Quiet Place.” I like them a lot. Horror seems to be the one genre that can can remain original and still succeed both commercially and artistically. You’re right. Even comedies have suffered.  I don’t know what’s funny to people anymore. Guys acting stupid. I can’t think of any that have moved me recently. And a lot of that is due to series television, where people got used to laugh tracks and everything that somebody says while sitting on the couch and eating a chicken egg gets uproarious laughter. I don’t know what people make of this stuff at home, staring at these people who are supposedly representative of American marriages in all of their various forms today. But they’re cracking jokes at each other. Is that how people go through life? Is that how you do? No, certainly not.  You have friends. Are you married? No, but I have a partner.  Do you guys sit around telling jokes to each other? I wish. But I think many sitcoms are more nuanced than you’re giving them credit for. And anyway, there’s a lot to be said for the value of escapism, which is what sitcoms offer. I couldn’t escape that way. That’s not an escape for me. What’s an escape for you? Reading a good book, fiction or nonfiction. Reading about something I wasn’t aware of before. Or listening to music. Miles Davis. Elvis. John Coltrane. Gil Evans. It’s hard for me to find somebody in today’s world, but there are many recording artists that I still listen to, especially in re-release. Sinatra. There’s nobody better with a lyric than Frank Sinatra. I like David Bowie a lot. Did you feel that way about television in the ’70s, like “All in the Family”? Well, not in the ’60s when you had really good humorists on TV. Jack Benny, Red Skelton, Burns and Allen. What changed? The zeitgeist changed. First of all, there are no performers like that anymore. They’re mostly people that read somebody else’s jokes and they’re not naturally funny to me.  Moving on to “The Devil and Father Amorth,” it’s pretty shocking to see footage of a supposed exorcism. What got left on the cutting-room floor? Almost nothing. I had planned to go back and do what we call b-roll with Cristina [the possessed woman in the movie], but she had freaked out by then. Father Amorth was in the hospital with pneumonia, and he never came out. I went back to do her 10th exorcism, and he couldn’t do it. Now she is out there seeking other help but has not been successful as of yet. [Amorth] was in a class by himself. He was totally original. He was the founder of the International Association of Exorcists. His work was supported and respected by the last three popes. He had been the Vatican exorcist for 31 years. So I fully expected to do her 10th or more, but he passed. There have been so many “Exorcist” knockoffs over the years. I’ve never seen them. I’ve never seen the sequels. Did you ever consider making one? No, no. [“Exorcist” screenwriter William Peter] Blatty did “Exorcist III,” which was not called that. It was from his novel called Legion, and then the film company got him to call it “Exorcist III” for obvious reasons. They threw an exorcism in, which he didn’t have. With all those knockoffs, the image of an exorcism has become mythologized and hyperbolized, partly because “The Exorcist” is so evocative. Understandably, demonic possession has a lot of skeptics. People could easily look at the footage in this movie and still cast doubts on the veracity of what actually happened. How do you feel about that? I filmed what I saw and experienced. That’s all. I didn’t make a film to convert skeptics. I’m not a skeptic. As a journalist, you should not be a skeptic. You shouldn’t be writing things and thinking people are out there to fool everyone. We’ve got to be open to what you may or may not get from what you’ve done, but you can’t approach life as a skeptic. First of all, you’re not old enough to be skeptical. I’m not saying I personally am skeptical.  No, but there are skeptics who just don’t care enough to examine the unexamined life, so they have an attitude about it. You want to know something? Nobody knows anything. Sure, we can agree on that. The greatest philosophers and scholars in the world do not know if there’s a heaven or a hell or an afterlife or anything about Jesus. We don’t know about the eternal verities, but I’m curious about all of them. I know I’ll never know, but that doesn’t stop me from being curious about things that happen that change the world. You have to be curious, for example, about why Trump became president. I am curious about that, yes. You have to be. He won 30 states. Now, Mrs. Clinton can blame Comey. She can blame this, that and the other, Russian collusion. But 30 states voted for Donald Trump, who was not a politician. And that tells you something about this country at this time. It could change, it could evolve. There was a time that people had faith in politicians and continued to vote for them. They voted against politicians when they voted for Trump. They’d had it. You know the politicians have all just lied to us as long as we can remember. Yes, but now we have somebody in office who has openly lied since being elected. Well, I don’t know that. The people who voted for him don’t know that. They wanted something else, and I think, by the way, that he was pretty straightforward with people. He said that he loved to have sex with who he considered beautiful women. We all knew that. He wasn’t denying it. He wasn’t saying that he was Jimmy Carter, a religious man married to the same woman forever. He’s no Jimmy Carter, that’s for sure. He was a reality-TV host, and they voted for him over a woman who’d been around politics most of her adult life. So I’m curious. Right, and maybe “skeptic” is the wrong word to get wrapped up in. Storytelling-wise, what we see in this documentary is fairly straightforward in its presentation, but ― Totally straightforward. It’s hardly edited. I shot these people talking, doing an exorcism, these doctors talking about it, and this is what they said. But I think anybody who watches documentaries with a critical mind should always question what’s being presented onscreen.  Why? Because whether a movie is edited heavily or not, a documentary filmmaker captures and assembles the footage however he or she chooses. She chooses who is featured and how the story unfolds and what information is included.  That’s true. So, what is fundamentally objective becomes subjective because it’s filtered through the lens of one filmmaker. It’s similar with journalism and newsgathering. So that’s why people might be skeptical of footage that claims to show a real exorcism. We don’t know what happened before and after the events we see in the film. Yeah, there’s no subjectivity in what I did with this documentary. This may not be as I feel at all. This is what I heard and saw. That’s it, and here it is. When I filmed the exorcism, I had no idea what I was going to do with it. And then it occurred to me to take it to neurosurgeons and psychiatrists and let them debunk it if that’s what they were going to do. And they didn’t. But it was up to them. I put not one word in their mouth. I asked them questions. I asked the neurosurgeon from Israel who’s done thousands of surgeries, “Do you have any religious beliefs?” He said something to the effect of, “Beyond what I can see and feel in the reasonable world, I do accept the existence of an entity called God.” Which doesn’t say he’s a religious man at all. He’s certainly not a Catholic. He tried to explain, from his perspective, what was going on with that woman. It was a religious-based disease in which everyone in the room, including the woman and her priest and her family and other priests who were there, were participating in something that they accepted to be her demonic possession and exorcism. If you have no religion, or if you’re a Jewish guy or a Muslim or of another faith entirely, you probably would not see an exorcist. It’s religious-based. The only treatment she or any of the other thousands of people who went to [Amorth] received was exorcism, but they had to see a medical doctor and psychiatrist in Italy first and be told that those skills were not going to help them. Then, if he had the time, he would do an exorcism. What do you make of Father Amorth’s more outlandish beliefs? He’s said that Stalin and Hitler were possessed by the devil, and that the devil had a hand in creating “Harry Potter.”  Well, I don’t have any problems about “Harry Potter.” He did, I guess, because it dealt with witchcraft. He wasn’t the only guy who was troubled by “Harry Potter.” Sure, it’s not a unique opinion. But you made him the subject of a documentary. So, what do I feel about what? Here’s what I feel. First of all, I feel there is evil in the world, without a doubt. Some of it has been alleviated by groups that have come out and spoken up for themselves and fought back, but it’s not even about group evil. There’s evil in every human being, just as there’s a bit of good in many human beings. But how do you explain a guy that goes up into the Mandalay Bay in Vegas and shoots up a rock concert? Or these guys that shoot up the schools? Or the nanny who cold-bloodedly killed two little girls? Is that sickness or is it evil? I don’t know. It may be both. Where does that come from? In the case of the woman in my documentary, the evil is directed at her, not from her. But I have seen evil in people that I know. You see it in the smallest way almost every day if you drive in Los Angeles. You see road rage. That’s when people turn evil. Have you never felt so badly about somebody that you might have wanted to kill them? We all have. You wouldn’t do it because you have restraints. Some people don’t have restraints. Father Amorth believed the devil was a metaphor, not an actual person or thing. Certainly I can’t argue with that. A few years ago, you said, “When you’re making a film, you don’t start to think of the social consequences, or whether there will be any.” But today’s filmmakers, as well as today’s audiences, do think more critically about the social implications of entertainment. We’re much more politically conscious, even though the ’70s are known for being such a politically charged decade in and out of Hollywood. Do you think that evolution toward socially conscious film criticism is a good thing? I don’t think so. No. I don’t know that I could say this is good, but it does happen. No, I think a film should be enjoyed on its own terms for the ingredients in it. You like the story or you don’t. You like these actors or you don’t. This interests you in the way it’s done or it doesn’t. To apply some other set of principles to it is so subjective. I don’t look at “The Boys in the Band” as a film simply about the gay lifestyle. It’s a wonderful love story to me, with great humor. And it’s still controversial, even as it reopens on Broadway. Part of why everything is so political right now is because the culture hasn’t served folks pushed to the margins. That speaks to the success of “Black Panther,” for example.  Yeah, I don’t go to see a work of entertainment to be politicized. I don’t know what the political nature of the Bruce Springsteen show is. It’s his life. I saw it. It was great. I know that his politics are liberal; that’s been obvious for years, before this show. But I enjoyed the show as entertainment, period — not entertainment from a liberal performer who’s trying to proselytize me about voting his way or something. Things are more politicized, you’re right. Everything is political. The whole idea of diversity kind of snags me. I think people should be hired on merit. I’ve always believed that, and yet they weren’t. But what happens when the system isn’t in place to hire people of merit who don’t fit the dominant demographic? It was always in place. I just have to tell you that when I hired people, I hired women, men, I didn’t know if they were gay or not gay. I could not have cared less. I was interested in their talent, period. And that’s all that you can be. I don’t like Michelangelo because he’s a gay artist. I like him because he’s a great artist. I don’t like Picasso because he was a straight artist. I value a work of art, be it music or painting or cinema, because of the work. I don’t give a good goddamn about Leonardo’s sexuality or Michelangelo’s or Miles Davis’. I just like the work, and I’m not going to hire somebody just because they’re black. If they’re black and good, that’s wonderful. If they’re black and they’re not as good as this other dude over here… Sure, but what happens when the people at the top — executives, for example — aren’t historically hiring people of color or greenlighting movies about queer people? It becomes a systemic issue. I don’t know anybody who is that way now, who would say, “I’m not going to make this story because the guy is gay or the guy is black or it’s a lesbian.” I don’t know anybody in charge of a studio who would do that today. You have to understand something. The guys who founded the movie industry all started at the bottom somewhere. They started in entry-level jobs. They were stage hands and gaffers and grips. They moved up to become directors. John Ford did that, and Howard Hawks. Some of the greats started on the crew, and they learned every facet of their work. That tradition carried on. There weren’t a lot of women then who sought out jobs as carpenters on a film. There just weren’t. Not because they thought they wouldn’t get them, but it just wasn’t the kind of job a woman sought. Now they do. The thing is, then there were a great many closeted homosexuals who started the film industry. But mostly they were straight guys who were working on the soundstages, or working an entry-level job somewhere and worked their way up. That tradition continued. Instead of carpenters, they became agents. And agents worked their way up to be heads of a studio. Now, I personally think the best action filmmaker in America today is Kathryn Bigelow, a woman. I think she’s a great director of actors and action. There were years when people wouldn’t hire her to do an action picture because they thought a woman couldn’t do that, until she did it. So it takes someone coming out of left field to do it. Why have there not been more women who were great artists? Great painters? There was one woman impressionist, I think, Marie Laurencin. Maybe there was somebody else, but I’m not aware offhand of any of the other impressionists being women, or the pre-Raphaelites or the 17th-century Dutch. The great movements of art: Where were the women’s paintings? They were not told you could not paint. But the canon is dominated by men. And art is full of gatekeepers. If you aren’t invited to the table to be exhibited in a gallery, for example, you’re never given the chance to be considered great. You don’t get to be invited. You do great work, it gets hung. Marie Laurencin was invited. If you do great work, it’s going to be seen. Vincent van Gogh never sold a painting in his lifetime, died at about 44 by committing suicide. You look at a van Gogh today and say, “This is great! What didn’t they see then?” And his brother, Theo, was the dealer for the impressionists. He couldn’t sell a Vincent. Why? Now you’ve got to be a billionaire to own a Vincent. What happened? In the short period of less that 100 years, van Gogh went from being unsaleable to one of the great appreciated masters. If Vincent sold one of his paintings then for what they sell now, he would have been a rich man and done more. But he produced well over 3,000 works: oils, water colors, drawings, prints. What did they have against him? He was great and he couldn’t sell, so it’s hard for me to make the argument that there are women like that who were great and couldn’t sell, because I don’t know any. But history always leaves people out.  Yeah, but nobody ever said that a gay painter will not be working. Michelangelo and Leonardo got the greatest commissions and delivered. I don’t know if anyone gave a shit what they were. Do you care? I don’t. No, but it’s hard to talk about today’s landscape by referencing Michelangelo. For a long time, the infrastructure wasn’t there for women directors and protagonists of color. There were women directors. Few and far between until just a few years ago. Ida Lupino, Dorothy Arzner. Sure, but they are not mentioned in the same breath as —  They weren’t as good. The weren’t as good as William Wyler, Orson Welles, Richard Brooks. Maybe, but the point is more that women weren’t invited to the table and then exalted at the same rate that Howard Hawks and John Ford were. You don’t get invited to the table. Well, someone has to sign over a paycheck. Someone has to hire you. During the classic studio system, especially. You don’t get invited to the table. You make your own place at the table. Many people think that I’m gay, but nobody knew or cared if I was or wasn’t. I swear to you. It never was a factor. I neither traded on that fact or not. And I frankly don’t care what people think of me, as long as they don’t think something horrible that isn’t true. But that’s not horrible to me. Who gives a flying fuck into a rolling donut? I really don’t. I never thought in working with someone — and that includes “The Boys in the Band” — “Are these guys gay? Is he gay? Is that guy gay?” The guy who played the most flaming character in the show was not gay. Cliff Gorman was doing an imitation of a gay man at that time. Some of the others who were, let’s say more butch, were gay. They were actors. And that’s all that seemed to matter. But the reason we can even sit here and have a 20-minute discussion about this movie is that culture was so starved for stories about gay characters in general, just as people are for the sort of characters of color we saw in “Black Panther.” You’re right. And they were not given opportunities. There’s no doubt about that. This interview has been edited for clarity and condensed for length. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"When two category 5 hurricanes slammed the U.S. Virgin Islands just two weeks apart this September, the storms devastated vital infrastructure in the territory home to more than 100,000 Americans. But the 200-mph winds also decimated foliage with the efficiency of a plague of locusts. The island paradise to which, for decades, millions have flocked to say wedding vows or simply vacation under the bright Caribbean sun amid dazzling blue water and lush greenery dotted with colorful flowers was left temporarily stripped of vegetation, the water clouded by runoff. “The most heartbreaking thing for me,” said Savanna Goodman, a photographer and longtime resident of St. Thomas, “was that the colors were gone from the flowers, the trees, the water, along with my job, my apartment, and my entire routine.” Goodman responded with “Our Colors Will Not Fade,” a photo series that showcases the bright colors of Carnival costumes against the stark backdrop of the wreckage. The photos highlight the vibrancy ingrained in the culture of the USVI, and the islanders’ indelible resilience. “The people of the Virgin Islands are what makes this place so special. The water is already clearing, and the trees will be green again,” she said. “We’re still here, glowing like always. I hope that I was able to capture that, and that’s what we really need the world to see.” “I’ve done Carnival makeup for many different troupes over the years. I was excited when Savanna approached me with this idea because it was a chance to do something creative again, something other than haul debris.” - Shary Cruz, who did makeup and costuming on the project. You can find more of her work on her Instagram page.  “Although I'm saddened by the destruction that has taken place and how it has affected myself and those I love, I am optimistic that we can rebuild and make this beautiful Caribbean gem better than it was before.” -Crystal Maree, model.  “My V.I. culture cannot be contained; it cannot be dimmed by tragedy. The colors of the Carnival costumes we wear are a direct representation of our spirits. They will not fade; they will not falter. They will bloom in the face of adversity. I will bloom in the face of adversity.” - Nicole Smith, model.  “Something like this keeps me positive somehow because we have the greatest thing of all and that for many of us islanders is hope. In a time when you think everything would tear us apart, it’s actually brought us all together!” -Meagan Ann Bryan, model.  “As we continue forward we will not stop growing, strengthening, and blooming our cultures colors more beautifully vibrant than ever. Our Colors will not fade.” -Natalie Harris, model. This is just a small selection of the photos in Goodman’s series. For more from “Our Colors Will Not Fade,” you can follow the photographer on Facebook and Instagram.

BUSINESS,"By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks posted sharp gains in another wild trading session on Tuesday, as indexes rebounded from the biggest one-day drops for the S&P 500 and the Dow in more than six years that stalled the market’s record run. Stocks swung from negative to positive after indexes started the session 2 percent lower, underscoring a return of volatility to a market that until recently was marked by an absence of major shifts. The Dow had a more than 1,100-point difference between its high and low on Tuesday. The sharp declines in recent days marked a pullback that had been long awaited by investors after the market minted record high after record high in a relatively calm ascent. “Despite violent moves in the last couple days in the market, fundamentals in the economy are very strong and it’s not just the U.S., it’s throughout the global economy,” said Alicia Levine, head of global investment strategy at BNY Mellon Investment Management in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 567.02 points, or 2.33 percent, to 24,912.77, the S&P 500 gained 46.2 points, or 1.74 percent, to 2,695.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 148.36 points, or 2.13 percent, to 7,115.88. Technology, materials and consumer discretionary were the top-performing sectors on Tuesday. Defensive sectors utilities and real estate were the only major S&P groups to end negative.

BUSINESS,"Don’t worry. You’ll still be able to bring home the bacon whenever you want.  News of a possible bacon shortage went viral across social media on Wednesday, but all the squealing was a little premature. “To imply that there’s going to be some shortage of bacon is wrong,” Steve Meyer, vice president of pork analysis at EMI Analytics, told The New York Times. “There’s plenty of hogs coming. There’s going to be plenty of bacon.” The news of a supposed shortage began circulating after it was reported that reserves of the frozen pork bellies from which most bacon is made fell to 17.8 million pounds in December, the lowest point for that month since 1957, according to USA Today.  “Today’s pig farmers are setting historic records by producing more pigs than ever,” Rich Deaton, president of the Ohio Pork Council, told Ohio’s Country Journal. “Yet our reserves are still depleting.” But Chris Young, executive director of the American Association of Meat Processors, told Time that it only takes six months to raise a pig for processing so farmers can catch up fast. “We are aware of reserve levels, however, we are not concerned,” Young was quoted as saying. “We don’t see America’s love of bacon going away anytime soon. The industry will not run out and farmers will respond in time to take advantage.” Indeed, Joyce Kelly, executive director of the Colorado Pork Producers Council, told CBS 4 in Denver that bacon inventories are expected to rise by 5 percent this year. The dip in the reserves caused pork belly prices to jump 20 percent in early January, so while bacon won’t be in short supply, it could cost a little more. Thus far, that hasn’t happened. A pound of bacon today is actually 11 percent cheaper than it was a year ago, per USA Today. And even if the price of bacon rises, it’s not expected to hurt sales much.  “People will pay what it costs to buy bacon because they love it,” Brooks Reynolds, creator of Iowa’s Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival, told The Associated Press."
POLITICS,"Me Too just got dealt a major blow by the Supreme Court. On Monday, in an opinion written by Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch, the court ruled 5-4 that it is legal for employers to require workers to sign away their right to file class-action lawsuits against the employer ― and instead be forced to take their disputes to individual arbitration, a private court system in which companies typically have the upper hand. For many women, the ruling means they will no longer be able to band together to fight systemic sexual discrimination or harassment in court. Women’s rights advocates were quick to decry the decision in Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis. “It is a real blow to women in the workplace. We have seen from the Me Too movement the power that comes from women’s voices coming together,” said Emily Martin, a vice president at the National Women’s Law Center. “This decision makes it so much harder for employees to challenge harassment or other forms of discrimination, which means those workplace abuses are more likely to continue.” Class-action lawsuits have been effective in forcing companies to change policies or practices that reinforce various forms of discrimination, including sex discrimination and gender pay disparities, said Nantiya Ruan, a professor at the University of Denver’s Sturm College of Law.   “An individual cannot change the way a corporation does business,” said Ruan, who is also of counsel at Outten & Golden, a law firm that represents employees in discrimination cases ― including one she is working on now against Goldman Sachs. Going it alone, the most a woman can generally hope for is a monetary judgment. But banding together, women who file class actions can do far more to ensure that a company stops discriminatory behavior. In the past, Ruan said, class actions have forced companies to change their ways. She pointed to a case that Home Depot settled in 1997, agreeing not only to pay the women suing the company millions of dollars but also to change its policies. There’s also a class-action arbitration right now in which hundreds of women who worked at Sterling Jewelers are collectively pursuing the company over sex discrimination and harassment. If those women had been forced to go it alone, as individuals, it’s doubtful whether many of them would have bothered to sue. The Supreme Court ruling comes at a time when women are increasingly speaking up about discrimination and harassment ― and when more companies are being put on notice that such mistreatment will no longer be tolerated. The decision is also a painful reminder that Me Too is facing a major hurdle in the top federal court, thanks in no small part to President Donald Trump. “The fact that Neil Gorsuch is the author of this opinion and he and the majority are exhibiting an incredible lack of understanding of what’s going on in today’s workplaces ― it brings it back to Trump,” said Catherine Ruckelshaus, general counsel at the National Employment Law Project. “He nominated Gorsuch and brought him in. Trump’s not for the worker and he’s not a women’s rights president.” Writing for the majority, Gorsuch held that agreements requiring employees to arbitrate must be enforced and that these agreements do not violate federal labor laws that guarantee workers the right to join forces in “mutual aid and protection.”  “The policy may be debatable but the law is clear: Congress has instructed that arbitration agreements like those before us must be enforced as written,” Gorsuch wrote. The Monday ruling, which covered three cases against three different companies, involved situations in which employees were allegedly not paid for work. But the decision has far-reaching consequences for many types of cases, including those raising racial and sexual discrimination and harassment claims. The decision will disproportionately impact low-income workers, who often lack the financial incentive or wherewithal to file complaints on their own. The costs of going to court, for example, would typically far outstrip the amount of back pay to which a woman experiencing pay discrimination in an hourly job would be entitled. Even for better-paid women, the expense of filing a case individually is often overwhelming. In a blistering dissent in the Epic Systems ruling, Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted that it would have cost one employee of Ernst & Young $200,000 to recover $1,867.02 in overtime pay. The consulting firm was one of the companies sued. “Those most vulnerable to workplace violations are going to be harmed the most,” said Martin. That point was echoed by Ginsburg, who called the majority’s ruling “egregiously wrong.” The 85-year-old justice, whose dissent was joined by the two other female justices, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, and by Stephen Breyer, said that joining together in litigation is beneficial for workers because it reduces the risk of retaliation. It’s harder for a company to fire hundreds of women than to get rid of one. “The inevitable result of today’s decision will be the underenforcement of federal and state statutes designed to advance the well-being of vulnerable workers,” Ginsburg wrote. She also noted that forcing many individual cases into arbitration will result in a lot of conflicting opinions ― which means those individual cases, typically settled in secrecy, won’t produce any meaningful clarity on the treatment of women at work. Right now, about 60 million workers have already signed away their right to go to court by agreeing to arbitrate disputes with their employers, according to an Economic Policy Institute analysis released last year. About 30 percent of those workers have also signed the kind of class-action waivers that were at issue in this decision. Expect that number to rise, said Ruckelshaus. She told HuffPost that she recently sat on a panel with an in-house lawyer who said companies were watching this case and if it came down in their favor, more would require employees to sign these agreements. Under massive public pressure, a few companies had recently said they would no longer require women who’d been harassed on their watch to go to arbitration. Most recently, Uber made such a pledge. However, the ride-hailing company also said it would still force class actions into arbitration."
BUSINESS,"It might be a stretch to say that American consumers are legally illiterate. After all, don't we watch Law & Order? In fact, one recent survey found that 10 percent of U.S. college graduates believed Judge Judy was on the Supreme Court. (In our political climate, I suppose anything is possible.) But when it comes to federal consumer laws, there is real ignorance. Day after day, I see consumers banging their heads against the wall. They know what's happening to them is wrong, that there ought to be a law, but they don't know enough about the law to invoke it. So which laws should you know about? I asked a few experts, and here's what they told me: The Electronic Funds Transfers Act (EFTA)
 ""It's not well known and not often utilized by consumers,"" says Larry Smith, a consumer rights attorney at SmithMarco, a Chicago law firm. The EFTA governs financial institutions and banks when allowing money to be transferred by computer terminal. ""Banks are required to provide certain disclosures to their customers,"" he explains. ""If there are errors that occur regarding a transfer, there are investigation requirements and other mandates regarding the re-funding of an account and the charging of interest on disputed transfers."" In other words, if you made a purchase and it involved an electronic transfer of money, chances are the EFTA protects you. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)
 ""This is the most important federal statute and regulation regarding the servicing of mortgage loans,"" says Josh Denbeaux, a financial consumer rights attorney. The federal statute governs the performance and enforcement of the loan. ""There are many, many times that mortgage servicers and lenders make mistakes in their accounting and servicing of the mortgage loan,"" he adds. ""Consumers have rights under RESPA and all would be well-served to read the CFPB website for its explanation of consumer rights under the statute."" The California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)
 Although this is technically not a federal law, it has national implications, explains Zachary Paruch, a small business expert at Termly, a site that helps you generate terms and conditions for your online business. CalOPPA stipulates that any online service which is based in California, or collects personal information from residents in California, is required to conspicuously post a privacy policy. ""This means that if an online business is located in, or can be accessed by anyone in California, it is subject to this regulation,"" he says. If your business doesn't disclose, it could be in violation of the law, which could work in your favor if you're trying to build a case. The Fiduciary Rule
 The rule, which is part of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) is a federal law that sets minimum standards for most voluntarily established pension and health plans in private industry to provide protection for individuals in these plans. But it contains a provision that sets important standards for your financial advisor. “It’s important that Americans who are saving for retirement are aware of the fiduciary rule,"" says Jay Shah, CEO of Personal Capital. The problem? The rule is changing, even as I write it, and the word ""fiduciary"" isn't in everyone's vocabulary. ""But what it means is very simple,"" adds Shah. ""It says that your financial advisor should be required to act in your best interest, not their own, when advising on retirement investment accounts. It should be called the ‘no conflict of interest rule.’” How misunderstood is the rule? Well, a few weeks ago, when I wrote about the fiduciary, I suggested the Trump administration had rescinded parts of it. Turns out the truth is a lot more complicated. This is by no means a complete list of essential consumer laws, but it's a start. Knowing about these laws will help you use them correctly the next time you have money to invest, buy a house, or purchase something online. And if a business won't listen, then you can have your day in court. Christopher Elliott specializes in solving unsolvable consumer problems. Contact him with your questions on his advocacy website.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Federico Patellani called himself “a new kind of journalist” in an article published in 1943; a journalist who learned to find “living, contemporary, thrilling” images from the movies. Because of his unique gift of “blending the values of documentary and beauty into a single photograph,” Patellani’s images have made history.

Among Patellani’s most iconic image is the radiant face of a girl bursting through the newspaper Corriere della Sera on June 2, 1946, her features lit up with the joyous news that Italy was about to become a republic. He took the shot for Alberto Mondadori’s Il Tempo, a weekly inspired by Life and known for skillfully pairing reporting and evocative photography. It was a philosophy Patellani could embrace wholeheartedly; though journalistic photography was a profession, not an art, it had to be beautiful in addition to bearing witness. This was a fairly novel concern for the time, but a natural one for a man who had been an artist in the past. This desire to meld beauty and truth is what made Patellani the first true Italian photojournalist.

In his photos, Patellani immortalized an Italy that was trying to forget the trials of its recent past. The country was licking its wounds after World War II, while contending with a rapidly evolving cultural landscape that combined economic success, the rise of the beauty pageant and cinema’s return to glory. Slices of that tumultuous time are captured in 90 images that are now on display at the Palazzo Madama in Turin, in an exhibition entitled ""Federico Patellani -- Profession: photojournalist.""

Patellani didn't limit himself to Italy. He was a foreign correspondent in Russia, reporting from the Eastern front and signing his work with the pseudonym Pat Monterosso. In 1954 he went to Greece and Turkey; the following year he traveled through southern Italy shooting television documentaries. In 1956, while traveling through America, Patellani shot a full-color movie, ""America Pagana (Pagan America),"" as well as a series of photographs for the weekly magazine Epoca. Epoca would later publish Patellani’s ""Paradiso Nero (Black Paradise),"" 160 pages covering the 1,500 miles the photojournalist traveled with his son Aldo aboard a Land Rover, driving from the Belgian Congo to Kenya.

From ancient European universities to recently-liberated African countries, from South America to the Pacific Islands, from Africa to the Amazon, Patellani traveled around the world many times over, reporting faithfully as he went. His last report was sent from Sri Lanka in 1976, one year before he died.  Here are some of the photographs Patellani took over his long and luminous career as a photojournalist. This post was originally published on HuffPost Italy and was translated into English."
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― The world’s largest telecommunications company, an investment firm tied to a Russian oligarch, a pharmaceutical conglomerate and an aircraft manufacturer competing for a government contract all sent money to President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer through the same shell company he used to pay off a porn star who says she had sex with the reality television star turned commander-in-chief. That raises a few questions. But even the most innocent explanation for the transactions — that companies were paying Trump lawyer Michael Cohen in an attempt to buy access to or influence the president — represents a form of corruption. Here’s what we know: AT&T paid Cohen’s limited liability company, Essential Consultants LLC, roughly $600,000, according to documents, but claimed that Cohen did no legal or lobbying work for the telecom firm. The company, which was seeking government approval of a merger with Time Warner Inc., said the payments were for “insights” into the administration. Columbus Nova, a New York investment firm with close ties to billionaire Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, paid Cohen’s LLC around $500,000 — which was a “consulting fee” that had nothing to do with Vekselberg, Columbus Nova’s lawyer told The New York Times. Novartis, a pharmaceutical giant, acknowledged paying Essential Consultants LLC $100,000 per month for one year ($1.2 million total) and said that “any agreements with Essential Consultants were entered before our current CEO taking office in February of this year and have expired.” They said the payments were for “healthcare policy matters.” A seven-page document prepared by Michael Avenatti, an attorney for Stormy Daniels, the adult film actress, said that Cohen’s company also received money from Korea Aerospace Industries. The company told Bloomberg it paid Cohen one $150,000 payment for advice on what the outlet refers to as local accounting standards. A spokesman maintained that their contract with Cohen was legal. We also know that the special counsel team headed up by Robert Mueller has known about all of this for awhile. Novartis told The Wall Street Journal that Mueller’s office contacted the company about six months ago, in November 2017. Cohen’s attorney Stephen Ryan did not respond to HuffPost’s inquiry about the payments, but told The Atlantic only that the money Essential Consultants LLC received from Columbus Nova was “not a payment.” But Tuesday night’s revelations still leave us with more questions than answers. Here are a few of the big ones: Several of these companies had business before the government or a vested interest in legislation the government was considering. But how did they come to pay the same shell company that Cohen used to pay Stormy Daniels? What were they expecting in exchange for their money? Cohen ― the graduate of what’s often called the worst law school in America ― had a “strategic alliance” with the law firm Squire Patton Boggs for about a year, which ended shortly after the FBI raided several locations used by Cohen, including his Squire Patton Boggs office at 30 Rock.  Korea Aerospace Industries has been working with American defense contractor Lockheed Martin to bid for a multi-billion dollar contract with the U.S. Air Force. That contract is expected to be awarded this year, according to The Times. AT&T paid Cohen four installments of $50,000 from early 2017 to January 2018. The telecommunications giant currently has a proposed merger with Time Warner pending before the Justice Department but has denied that Cohen did any “legal or lobbying work” for the company. Some have also noted that AT&T’s payments ended shortly after Ajit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, voted to repeal net neutrality.  It’s unclear precisely what services Cohen ― not a man necessarily known for his expertise on health care policy ― provided to the pharmaceutical company Novartis. Novartis and AT&T didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. “How the fuck did Avenatti find out?” a source who confirmed the payments did in fact happen asked The Daily Beast Tuesday. Avenatti said on MSNBC Tuesday night that he knew “for a fact” there were three Suspicious Activity Reports filed with the Treasury Department by a bank that handled money paid to Cohen’s LLC. Banks are required to file such reports, also known as SARs, when they know or suspect that transactions “involve money laundering or violate the Bank Secrecy Act.” Avenatti said the Treasury Department should release those reports and claimed that officials had rejected his prior requests to do so. Some have speculated Avenatti has already gotten access to those reports and that they were the basis of the document released Tuesday. He pushed that point on Twitter later Tuesday evening, saying there was ”no reason why the SARs should not be released.” “Demand it!” he concluded. So far, the White House hasn’t commented and referred questions to Trump’s outside lawyers. Trump lawyer Rudy Guiliani said he didn’t know anything about Essential Consulting’s work. And Cohen has likewise remained mum. But Cohen has long been Trump’s personal lawyer and a trusted fixer. As recently as last month, Trump maintained that Cohen was still his lawyer, even though he has moved to distance himself from the man in recent weeks. “You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One in response to a question about a hush money payment to Daniels. “Michael is my attorney. You’ll have to ask Michael.” At least $4.4 million flowed through Cohen’s LLC between just before Trump’s election through January, the New York Times reported. A Washington Post breakdown said there is more money somewhere, but details are incomplete. Avenatti speculated that the answer to this question is the bigger issue. “It’s where did the money go,” he said on MSNBC before challenging Cohen to release his bank statements affiliated with the LLC. “If there’s nothing to hide here and it’s all above board and it’s all legal, then the documents will prove that out. People lie, documents don’t. Period.” S.V. Date and Amanda Terkel contributed reporting. This article has been updated with more recently reported figures for the amount paid to Cohen by AT&T.

ARTS & CULTURE,"The  Street Art community donates time and art to a program that keeps teens  out of jail in New York. An annual auction overflows with work by today’s Street Artists. With the precision indicative of her architect training Rachel Barnard describes the art/criminal justice project for youth that she founded five years ago – which keeps growing thanks to artists’ help, community involvement, and an evermore engaged criminal justice system. “Alternative Diversion,” she calls it, this court-mandated art program that prosecutors can offer to New York teens as a sentencing option instead of incarceration or doing community service. “What we’re talking about here are 16 and 17 year-olds in Brooklyn who have been arrested for things like jumping the (subway) turnstyle or having a  small amount of marijuana on them or petty larceny,” Barnard explains in a new video for YNY. “Say you get a misdemeanor record at 16,” she says, “What that means is that you’re less likely to get employment, even though you are more likely to be poor and need employment more than most other 16 year-olds.” Each year the programs called Young New Yorkers (YNY), which Barnard founded, work directly with these youth to redirect their route in life, to provide guidance, foster self-analyzation and to set productive goals for the future. To  some observers it may sound ironic that Street Artists, many of whom have done illegal artworks on walls throughout New York City, are the principal artists pool who are donating their time and talent here to the fundraising auction in lower Manhattan. With high profile names like Shepard Fairey, Daze, Dan Witz, the Guerrilla Girls and Kara Walker on this years list of artists donating to the  auction, the program boasts a cross section of established and emerging Street Artists, graffiti artists, culture jammers and truth tellers who  heartily support this program that since 2012 has given more than 400  city youth a second chance. But then we think more about the history and psychological/anthropological  makeup of the Street Art scene and it makes perfect sense: What segment of the arts community has such a rich history of activism, self-directed industry, challenging the norms of society, using public space for intervention – and a penchant for consciousness-raising?  Even after 50 plus years of youth culture in love with graffiti and Street Art these artists and their practice are seen as outside the proper curriculum of many universities with art programs and museums have arduous internal debates about supporting exhibitions that are dedicated  to Street Art and graffiti specifically.  This is precisely the kind of marginalized movement/ subculture that has necessarily thrived often with little encouragement or funding –  overcoming the barriers to success that more institutionally recognized art movements don’t encounter. In fact, many have gone to jail for what they do. Uniquely, Young New Yorkers continues to build its partnerships with artists, teachers, lawyers, volunteers and several agencies within the criminal  justice system, including criminal and community courts, the District Attorney’s Office and the Legal Aid Society. The program’s art shows mounted by graduates are frequently attended by members of the justice system as well and art becomes a facilitator of strengthened community ties. BSA has supported YNY every year since its first auction benefit and this year is no exception. Please go to Paddle 8 to see the items for sale or better yet, go to the auction in person. We stopped by while they were hanging the show yesterday and we were able to take a few shots for you to see what’s up for grabs.

ARTS & CULTURE,"It’s been a chaotic week for American politics. And an even busier week for President Donald Trump’s Twitter presence. It might seem like the leader of the free world has a full plate ― what with people questioning the future of health care, the former FBI Director James Comey’s firing and the general state of infrastructure in the U.S., to name just a few concerns ― but no. Somehow, he still has time to tweet about public enemy No. 1 Rosie O’Donnell AND flex his seemingly obscure idiom skills in yet another reference to his defeat of Hillary Clinton. Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election. “Russia must be laughing up their sleeves,” he wrote, “watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election.” ”Laughing up their what?” the American people collectively asked. @realDonaldTrump ""laughing up their sleeves""? I think ""laughing up their sleeves"" sounded better in the original Russian https://t.co/Ub4lHjjU2t I guess ""laughing up their sleeves"" is a Russian expression that doesn't translate well to English https://t.co/eRsIobGVVn WYD?The usual: standing among bushes, laughing up my sleeves @realDonaldTrump ""Laughing up their sleeves""????Probably sounds better in the original Russian because no American has ever used this phrase. We all chuckled but we all also excused ourselves to somewhere private to try laughing up our sleeves in search of some recognizable act He was laughing up his sleeve so bigly he choked like a dog, it was unbelievable, nobody had ever done it before. Believe me. RuSsiA MuST bE lAugHInG uP ThEiR SLeEveS pic.twitter.com/TuLUuxKStC Spotted in the Oval yesterday: Russians ""laughing up their sleeves"" pic.twitter.com/f7v6jtcjjw The particular assortment of word salad is actually a real phrase, though. According to Merriam-Webster, universal guardian of language, it means “to be secretly happy about or amused by something (such as someone else’s trouble).” Oxford Dictionaries concurs, defining it as being “secretly or inwardly amused.” It sounds like a perfect idiom for Trump’s America, to be honest. Who, these days, isn’t laughing up their sleeves about one thing or another? Take, for example, Merriam-Webster’s use of the phrase in a sentence: “The mayor’s critics were laughing up their sleeves when news of the scandal was first reported.”  Tweaked slightly it becomes: “Hillary Clinton was laughing up her sleeve when Donald Trump first won the GOP nomination.”  Yeah, we enter it. https://t.co/3vvrAEFBHu So, while you might have become accustomed to guffawing at the 140-character declarations slung by our commander-in-chief, this one’s real. The dictionary-in-chief has spoken."
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON, May 2 (Reuters) - The United States announced on Wednesday the first transfer of a prisoner from the Guantanamo Bay detention center under U.S. President Donald Trump, lowering the prisoner population at a facility Trump has signaled he would like to repopulate. The U.S. military said Ahmed Muhammed Haza al-Darbi’s transfer to Saudi Arabia reduced the detainee population to 40 from 41. He was the first prisoner to leave the U.S. detention center in Cuba since Jan. 19, 2017 - the day before Trump was inaugurated. Reuters reported in March that al-Darbi’s transfer was advancing. Commander Sarah Higgins, a Pentagon spokeswoman, noted that the transfer was provided under the terms of a 2014 plea deal, which will allow al-Darbi to serve out the rest of his 13-year sentence there. “The United States coordinated with the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to ensure the transfer took place in accordance with established standards for security and humane treatment,” Higgins said. Saudi Arabia’s state news agency, SPA, said al-Darbi arrived in the kingdom late on Wednesday. The prison, opened by Republican President George W. Bush to hold terrorism suspects captured overseas after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks came to symbolize harsh detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture. U.S. officials have not ruled out adding to the prisoner population again and have acknowledged trouble repatriating Islamic State fighters being held by U.S.-backed forces in Syria, raising the possibility that Guantanamo Bay could be seen as a viable option in the future.   Trump’s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, reduced the inmate population to 41 from 242, but fell short of fulfilling his promise to close the jail before leaving office last year. In contrast, Trump pledged during his campaign to repopulate the prison, saying he wanted to “to load it up with some bad dudes.” Trump signed an order in January to keep the detention center open and hinted in his State of the Union address to Congress this year that Islamic State or al Qaeda fighters could be added to the prison population. He also asked the Pentagon to re-examine the U.S. military’s detention policy. To that end, the Pentagon said on Wednesday it updated its guidance on criteria for transferring new detainees to Guantanamo Bay. “This policy provides our warfighters guidance on nominating detainees for transfer to Guantanamo detention should that person present a continuing, significant threat to the security of the United States,” said Higgins. A White House National Security Council spokesman confirmed it had received the new detainee criteria. “We have no further comment at this time,” the spokesman said. The U.S. military has long struggled with what to do about prisoners of war in an open-ended battle against Islamist extremism, in which militants have come from all corners of the world to fight in places like Syria. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on Monday that there were well over 400 foreign fighters being held by U.S.-backed forces in Syria. Although there was an effort to send those fighters back to their home countries, that was not always easy, he noted. “In some cases, those countries (where the fighters came from) have stripped them of their citizenship,” Mattis said. “So they have a different view as far as what their status is today. So this is not simple.” Critics of the U.S. military detention system say militants can be best prosecuted in civilian courts and have seized on the high costs of housing inmates at Guantanamo Bay as one argument why indefinite detention is misguided."
ARTS & CULTURE,"  Can you imagine what's it like to hand-collect bacterial specimens from 100 of your closest female friends and colleagues? According to Anicka Yi, the intrepid artist behind a new installation at New York's Kitchen space, it requires a lot of legwork, q-tips and ziplock bags, plus a desire to turn field reporter/mad scientist on your peers.  For her project ""You Can Call Me F,"" she successfully gathered samples from 100 women, as part of a larger effort to draw a parallel between the fear of contagion and the unease with which some view feminism and its ability to redirect power. That might seem like a big leap, from bacteria to banging down the doors of patriarchy. That's because unpacking Yi's project is hard work, so it's best to start with the basics.
 Anicka Yi, Grabbing At Newer Vegetables, 2015, Plexiglas, agar, female bacteria, fungus, 84.5 x 24.5 inches, Courtesy of the artist and 47 Canal   Korean-born, American-based Yi is currently in residence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she's been working with synthetic biologists in the hopes of creating a superbacterium. That's where the 100 samples come in. Yi and her MIT collaborator, Tal Danino, are engineering the superbacterium from the biological information she gathered. That superbacterium is what's producing a ""pretty pungent"" odor at the Kitchen.  The smell -- Yi also described it, in a phone call with The Huffington Post, as ""a little funky"" -- is but one sensual layer in an installation chock-full of visual cues that recall viruses, hygiene and the gritty nuances of encroaching ecosystems. At the Kitchen, her specimens sit inside plastic quarantine tents stuffed next to incubating hydro gel beads, motorcycle helmets and dried shrimp. The ephemera helps build a laboratory of paranoia, an environment meant to mimic the passing fright one may just as easily attach to an Ebola outbreak as the growing organization of women's networks.
 Anicka Yi, Detail of Fontenelle, 2015, Vinyl, steel pipes, motorcycle helmet, scent diffuser, glass container, water, kombucha, scoby leather, nylon string, worklight, 122 x 78 x 50 inches, Courtesy of the artist and 47 Canal   ""All the women [who gave samples] are in my professional network,"" Yi explained. ""They are artists and curators and theorists and critics and collectors. These are the people I come into contact with on a day-to-day basis. Since the premise [of the project] is that a virus could start with any one person, I had to have come into contact with these women over the course of three to six months. I would have had body contact, have been in the same room or at the same party. I really wanted to create the essence that we are physically together, exchanging energy and senses. Feminism -- it's all in the air."" Aside from the specimens, another fleeting smell lingers in ""You Can Call Me F."" It's subtle, but not for lack of trying. You see the odor was gleaned from the inside of one of Larry Gagosian's galleries in New York City, a network of art havens Yi refers to as ""representative of the apex of patriarchy."" The smell is actually more a lack of smell, what Yi bottles up as a combination of cleaning products and anxiety. While you might not notice it, its inclusion in the show plays a major roll. Smell, according to Yi, is part of a greater value system.  ""In our society, in the West, we associate power with no smell. We don’t want to think of the President of the United States or the IMF as having a smell. Finance and government are associated with a lack of smell,"" Yi asserts. ""When something is very pungent and funky in our society, [it is often associated with] someone who is uneducated or impoverished or an immigrant. I really wanted to foreground these prejudices. What are these smells? How do we attribute value to these kinds of smells? It comes down to hygiene and discomfort, along the lines of gender and ethnicity.""
 Anicka Yi, You Can Call Me F installation view, 2015   In another life, Yi had entertained a career in perfumery, but the art world is where she took root. Like any other field, it has its problems. ""There is a feeling one encounters as a female artist, a feeling I felt about a year ago. I started noticing very obvious things that other male counterparts do -- they really organize, run in packs, and are there to boost each other. There’s a sort of an instinct that males have, a survival instinct. 'I can advance if we advance each other.' Which creates a solid power structure. I noticed that women don’t do that. We tend to abandon the group, for a lot of different reasons."" Yi's work isn't meant to solve the problem outlined above. She notes self-organization and support systems are popping up all around her, in which women are choosing not to assimilate but to form packs within the ""giant power petri dish"" of art galleries. A more general fear of feminism persists in Western society though. And if anything, Yi believes her project just brings up more questions, rather than resolutions, about the future of women and, well, smells. ""There are so many misconceptions about smell,"" she concludes. ""It’s all purely subjective, and we have no real vocabulary around it. In other cultures, they have hundreds of words to describe smells. We don’t have a consensus. It’s a very undeveloped area.""

While the scientists she's surrounded by at MIT strive to prove hypotheses in study, Yi relishes the interdisciplinary flexibility of art making, and her world's willingness to fail. ""It’s a medium for me, failure. I’m prepared for failure. I set out with that in mind."" And because Yi's installation aims to connect a dense configuration of dots in as many ways as it can, the title of the show hides another association. The ""F"" in ""You Can Call Me F"" -- a sly nod to the heightened thriller excitement of classic novels like V for Vendetta -- can stand for anything. ""Female. Fungus. Failure. You name it."" ""You Can Call Me F"" will be on view at the Kitchen until April 11, 2015.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Approximately 125 years ago, a child named Henry Darger was born in Chicago. His life was lonely and riddled with pain ― the majority spent working as a janitor, attending mass or working alone in his Chicago apartment. When he died in 1973, he had few companions save for his landlord Nathan Lerner, who, upon clearing out his former tenant’s belongings, made an unusual discovery. Among the possessions of his unassuming lodger, Lerner found thousands of pages of text, disturbing and dreamlike drawings, and one of the longest works of fiction ever made. Darger is now regarded as one of the most exceptional outsider artists of all time. He’s is often described as an “outsider” because he was self-taught, isolated and removed from artistic institutions. It also doesn’t hurt that few details are definitively known about Darger’s life, rendering his violent and visionary works all the more mystifying and retroactively transforming him into a sort of urban legend. In 2000, Intuit ― a nonprofit organization dedicated to the preservation of outsider art ― acquired the contents of Darger’s Lincoln Park apartment, where he lived and worked for 40 years. In 2008, Intuit used these belongings to build an environment meant to mimic Darger’s apartment, thereby offering his fans and skeptics a mediated glimpse into the artist’s world.  In honor of the 125th anniversary of Darger’s birth, Intuit has scheduled a year-long string of exhibits and events focusing on the artist and his work. On view until the end of May is a show called “Source Materials,” featuring clippings of children’s books, comics, cartoons and other documents referenced in Darger’s epic, The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinian War Storm Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion. This verbose title ― often referred to as The Realms, for short ― hardly hints at the overgrown narration that blossoms across Darger’s 15,145-page tale. It’s a book so long that, according to rumor, no one has ever read it start to finish. What’s more, there is an 8,000-page sequel. The story revolves around the Vivian Girls, seven noble, young princesses hailing from the Catholic and moral land of Angelina, as they battle the Satan-worshipping Glandelinians, an evil empire who practices child slavery and torture. Although the girls are framed as the young heroines, they endure plenty of graphic horrors at the hands of their captors ― including strangulation, crucifixion and disembowelment ― along the way.  “Little girls, from the ages of nine, eight and even younger, were tied down stark naked and a spade full of red-hot live coals laid on their bellies,” one excerpt reads. “Scores upon scores of poor children were cut to pieces, after being strangled to death ... Children were forced to swallow the sliced fragments of dead children’s hearts ... Their protruding tongues were extracted.’’  The fact that the depictions of darling girls being mutilated, tortured and killed appear in the honeyed, retro aesthetic of old-school bedtime books makes them all the more alarming.  The chilling details of Darger’s visuals in The Realms raise a candle to the depths of his imagination. His ambiguities are thought to have mirrored his own inner battles, too ― his simultaneous desire to enact suffering one minute and thwart it the next. Occasionally, Darger inserts himself into the narrative, both as General Darge (a “protector of children”) and as a bloodthirsty Glandelinian. He also drafted two alternate endings: Good prevails in one, evil in the other.  Ambiguity is present, as well, in the very anatomy of Darger’s characters, who include young girls drawn with penises. Myriad hypothesis circle this strange detail. Perhaps Darger wasn’t familiar with female genitalia, or felt torn between male and female himself, as did a character in his other book, Crazy Horse. Whatever the personal motivation for Darger’s choice, it speaks to his interest in illustrating the paradoxical, the two-at-once, the eternal in-between. From the little that is known about Darger’s life, it is clear his relationship with the concept of childhood was intense and fraught. Many art historians account for his obsession with childhood because of the traumas endured in his own. At 4 years old, Darger’s mother died during childbirth and his newborn sister was immediately put up for adoption. At 8, his father, impoverished and ill, relinquished Darger to a home for boys. After lashing out in school, he was committed to the “Asylum for Feeble Minded Children,” a nightmarish, abusive institution that Darger eventually escaped at 17.  After hopping a train back to Chicago, Darger went on to live what, from the outside, resembled a modest, solitary life. His free time, however, was spent furiously transcribing fears and fantasies into wild and sprawling narratives, formed both from images and words.  Because he never went to art school or received technical training, Darger drew heavily from source materials in rendering his picture-perfect girls. He hoarded scraps of imagery that he would trace, copy and collage onto this burgeoning canvases. The resulting works combine the immediately recognizable innocence of sweet storybook illustrations with the fermenting horror of Darger’s carefully inflicted suffering, yielding some of the most difficult-to-digest depictions of all time.  “Source Materials” provides a tour through the unwitting accomplices in Darger’s twisted fantasies. Horns from a ram in a coloring book emerge in dragon-like beasts he called called Blengins. And innocent children, pictured stirring cereal and riding swings, end up splayed and bloodied on Darger’s page.  Perhaps some of the cult fixation on his sources is correlated to the dearth of available information regarding most aspects of his life. The black-and-white coloring book pages serve in place of the family albums, report cards, artist notes and other primary documents we are not privy to. The sugary sweet scraps show the Vivian Girls and their fantastical cohorts in better days, before they got wrapped up in the brilliant nightmares of one lonely janitor.  ""Henry Darger: Source Materials,"" curated by Alison Amick, runs until May 29 at Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art in Chicago. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Negative space, in art, is defined as the area that surrounds the subject of an image. Think the black blanket of night cast against the jagged edges of a skyscraper, or the misty blue ocean punctuated by a lone figure in the middle. Cutting out the excess, eliminating the drama, negative space allows our eyes to focus on the subject of an image, no matter how subtle it may be. It also allows us to revel in the beauty of simplicity, the artistic equivalent of staring at a cloudless sky.      By Thomas Lim Today we're honoring a group of photographers who know the power of negative space. The following images were contributions to Eyeem's Negative Space Challenge, which dared artists to utilize empty space in radical and inviting ways. Below you'll see the power of negative space as realized by painted walls, blue skies, concrete streets and shadowy interiors.

BUSINESS,"The ability to manage your emotions and remain calm under pressure has a direct link to your performance. TalentSmart has conducted research with more than a million people, and we’ve found that 90% of top performers are skilled at managing their emotions in times of stress in order to remain calm and in control. If you follow our newsletter, you’ve read some startling research summaries that explore the havoc stress can wreak on one’s physical and mental health (such as the Yale study, which found that prolonged stress causes degeneration in the area of the brain responsible for self-control). The tricky thing about stress (and the anxiety that comes with it) is that it’s an absolutely necessary emotion. Our brains are wired such that it’s difficult to take action until we feel at least some level of this emotional state. In fact, performance peaks under the heightened activation that comes with moderate levels of stress. As long as the stress isn’t prolonged, it’s harmless. Research from the University of California, Berkeley, reveals an upside to experiencing moderate levels of stress. But it also reinforces how important it is to keep stress under control. The study, led by post-doctoral fellow Elizabeth Kirby, found that the onset of stress entices the brain into growing new cells responsible for improved memory. However, this effect is only seen when stress is intermittent. As soon as the stress continues beyond a few moments into a prolonged state, it suppresses the brain’s ability to develop new cells. “I think intermittent stressful events are probably what keeps the brain more alert, and you perform better when you are alert,” Kirby says. For animals, intermittent stress is the bulk of what they experience, in the form of physical threats in their immediate environment. Long ago, this was also the case for humans. As the human brain evolved and increased in complexity, we’ve developed the ability to worry and perseverate on events, which creates frequent experiences of prolonged stress. Besides increasing your risk of heart disease, depression, and obesity, stress decreases your cognitive performance. Fortunately, though, unless a lion is chasing you, the bulk of your stress is subjective and under your control. Top performers have well-honed coping strategies that they employ under stressful circumstances. This lowers their stress levels regardless of what’s happening in their environment, ensuring that the stress they experience is intermittent and not prolonged. While I’ve run across numerous effective strategies that successful people employ when faced with stress, what follows are ten of the best. Some of these strategies may seem obvious, but the real challenge lies in recognizing when you need to use them and having the wherewithal to actually do so in spite of your stress. 1. They Appreciate What They Have Taking time to contemplate what you’re grateful for isn’t merely the “right” thing to do. It also improves your mood, because it reduces the stress hormone cortisol by 23%. Research conducted at the University of California, Davis found that people who worked daily to cultivate an attitude of gratitude experienced improved mood, energy, and physical well-being. It’s likely that lower levels of cortisol played a major role in this. 2. They Avoid Asking “What If?”  “What if?” statements throw fuel on the fire of stress and worry. Things can go in a million different directions, and the more time you spend worrying about the possibilities, the less time you’ll spend focusing on taking action that will calm you down and keep your stress under control. Calm people know that asking “what if? will only take them to a place they don’t want—or need—to go. 3. They Stay Positive Positive thoughts help make stress intermittent by focusing your brain’s attention onto something that is completely stress-free. You have to give your wandering brain a little help by consciously selecting something positive to think about. Any positive thought will do to refocus your attention. When things are going well, and your mood is good, this is relatively easy. When things are going poorly, and your mind is flooded with negative thoughts, this can be a challenge. In these moments, think about your day and identify one positive thing that happened, no matter how small. If you can’t think of something from the current day, reflect on the previous day or even the previous week. Or perhaps you’re looking forward to an exciting event that you can focus your attention on. The point here is that you must have something positive that you’re ready to shift your attention to when your thoughts turn negative. 4. They Disconnect Given the importance of keeping stress intermittent, it’s easy to see how taking regular time off the grid can help keep your stress under control. When you make yourself available to your work 24/7, you expose yourself to a constant barrage of stressors. Forcing yourself offline and even—gulp!—turning off your phone gives your body a break from a constant source of stress. Studies have shown that something as simple as an email break can lower stress levels. Technology enables constant communication and the expectation that you should be available 24/7. It is extremely difficult to enjoy a stress-free moment outside of work when an email that will change your train of thought and get you thinking (read: stressing) about work can drop onto your phone at any moment. If detaching yourself from work-related communication on weekday evenings is too big a challenge, then how about the weekend? Choose blocks of time where you cut the cord and go offline. You’ll be amazed at how refreshing these breaks are and how they reduce stress by putting a mental recharge into your weekly schedule. If you’re worried about the negative repercussions of taking this step, first try doing it at times when you’re unlikely to be contacted—maybe Sunday morning. As you grow more comfortable with it, and as your coworkers begin to accept the time you spend offline, gradually expand the amount of time you spend away from technology. 5. They Limit Their Caffeine Intake Drinking caffeine triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline is the source of the “fight-or-flight” response, a survival mechanism that forces you to stand up and fight or run for the hills when faced with a threat. The fight-or-flight mechanism sidesteps rational thinking in favor of a faster response. This is great when a bear is chasing you, but not so great when you’re responding to a curt email. When caffeine puts your brain and body into this hyperaroused state of stress, your emotions overrun your behavior. The stress that caffeine creates is far from intermittent, as its long half-life ensures that it takes its sweet time working its way out of your body. 6. They Sleep I’ve beaten this one to death over the years and can’t say enough about the importance of sleep to increasing your emotional intelligence and managing your stress levels. When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, shuffling through the day’s memories and storing or discarding them (which causes dreams), so that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your self-control, attention, and memory are all reduced when you don’t get enough—or the right kind—of sleep. Sleep deprivation raises stress hormone levels on its own, even without a stressor present. Stressful projects often make you feel as if you have no time to sleep, but taking the time to get a decent night’s sleep is often the one thing keeping you from getting things under control. 7. They Squash Negative Self-Talk A big step in managing stress involves stopping negative self-talk in its tracks. The more you ruminate on negative thoughts, the more power you give them. Most of our negative thoughts are just that—thoughts, not facts. When you find yourself believing the negative and pessimistic things your inner voice says, it’s time to stop and write them down. Literally stop what you’re doing and write down what you’re thinking. Once you’ve taken a moment to slow down the negative momentum of your thoughts, you will be more rational and clear-headed in evaluating their veracity. You can bet that your statements aren’t true any time you use words like “never,” “worst,” “ever,” etc. If your statements still look like facts once they’re on paper, take them to a friend or colleague you trust and see if he or she agrees with you. Then the truth will surely come out. When it feels like something always or never happens, this is just your brain’s natural threat tendency inflating the perceived frequency or severity of an event. Identifying and labeling your thoughts as thoughts by separating them from the facts will help you escape the cycle of negativity and move toward a positive new outlook. 8. They Reframe Their Perspective Stress and worry are fueled by our own skewed perception of events. It’s easy to think that unrealistic deadlines, unforgiving bosses, and out-of-control traffic are the reasons we’re so stressed all the time. You can’t control your circumstances, but you can control how you respond to them. So before you spend too much time dwelling on something, take a minute to put the situation in perspective. If you aren’t sure when you need to do this, try looking for clues that your anxiety may not be proportional to the stressor. If you’re thinking in broad, sweeping statements such as “Everything is going wrong” or “Nothing will work out,” then you need to reframe the situation. A great way to correct this unproductive thought pattern is to list the specific things that actually are going wrong or not working out. Most likely you will come up with just some things—not everything—and the scope of these stressors will look much more limited than it initially appeared. 9. They Breathe The easiest way to make stress intermittent lies in something that you have to do everyday anyway: breathing. The practice of being in the moment with your breathing will begin to train your brain to focus solely on the task at hand and get the stress monkey off your back. When you’re feeling stressed, take a couple of minutes to focus on your breathing. Close the door, put away all other distractions, and just sit in a chair and breathe. The goal is to spend the entire time focused only on your breathing, which will prevent your mind from wandering. Think about how it feels to breathe in and out. This sounds simple, but it’s hard to do for more than a minute or two. It’s all right if you get sidetracked by another thought; this is sure to happen at the beginning, and you just need to bring your focus back to your breathing. If staying focused on your breathing proves to be a real struggle, try counting each breath in and out until you get to 20, and then start again from 1. Don’t worry if you lose count; you can always just start over. This task may seem too easy or even a little silly, but you’ll be surprised by how calm you feel afterward and how much easier it is to let go of distracting thoughts that otherwise seem to have lodged permanently inside your brain. 10. They Use Their Support System It’s tempting, yet entirely ineffective, to attempt tackling everything by yourself. To be calm and productive, you need to recognize your weaknesses and ask for help when you need it. This means tapping into your support system when a situation is challenging enough for you to feel overwhelmed. Everyone has someone at work and/or outside work who is on their team, rooting for them, and ready to help them get the best from a difficult situation. Identify these individuals in your life and make an effort to seek their insight and assistance when you need it. Something as simple as talking about your worries will provide an outlet for your anxiety and stress and supply you with a new perspective on the situation. Most of the time, other people can see a solution that you can’t because they are not as emotionally invested in the situation. Asking for help will mitigate your stress and strengthen your relationships with those you rely upon.   Want to learn more from me? Check out my book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0."
ARTS & CULTURE,"On Thursday, a hashtag swept the “Star Wars” Twittersphere alerting fans that an announcement was on the horizon. That announcement, per the Del Rey Star Wars Twitter account, was to have something to do with a much-anticipated book code-named #OperationBlueMilk. On Friday, Del Ray spilled the denta beans, revealing that the book in question, Star Wars: From a Certain Point of View, is due out October 2017. The book involves more than 40 authors telling 40 stories that center around the background characters of “A New Hope.” (Think “X-wing pilots who helped Luke destroy the Death Star,” according to the Star Wars website, and “stormtroopers who never quite could find the droids they were looking for.” And most definitely everyone in the that cantina.) From a Certain Point of View will celebrate the 40th anniversary of “Star Wars: A New Hope,” which was released in 1977. But instead of honoring those staple characters ― you know, like Princess Leia and C3PO ― the book will pay tribute to those “really weird background characters” that help make the “Star Wars” universe so rich. So far, the public lineup of authors includes 28 men and women, some of whom have written “Star Wars”-related books and stories before, and others who’ve yet to dabble in the galaxy, but have demonstrated writing chops as mainstream authors elsewhere. Most notably, none of the authors will receive compensation for their work on the book, as their earnings are being donated to First Book, a nonprofit social enterprise that provides books and learning materials to children in need. Publisher Penguin Random House has also pledged $100,000 to the charity, while Disney/Lucasfilm reportedly donated approximately $1 million in books. From a Certain Point of View ― which you can preorder here, using this clandestine listing ― is not the first “Star Wars” book (you can check out several here), but it is the latest. And if we’re finally going to figure out what “Fiery” Figrin D’an is all about, we’re there for it."
ARTS & CULTURE," Before Stalin-era Soviet restrictions on artistic expression turned Aleksandr Rodchenko's work into a paean to Communism, the legendary Russian artist revolutionized photography. ""We have a duty to experiment"" was his motto, turning away from a century of ""introspective"" photography. With his Leica in hand, Rodchenko spent the 1920s creating daring experiments with perspective; he photographed with an outward focus and unusual points of view, framing the images with bold, oblique cuts. He lived through radical changes in his home country and ended up sparking radical change in his chosen art form. Born in St. Petersburg in 1891, Rodchenko saw the end of the Tsarist empire, greeted the coming of Lenin, and witnessed the Stalinist purges. As the son of a turbulent generation, he could not be anything but turbulent himself. While his initial work during the 1910s and 1920s was part of the thriving Russian artistic avant-garde, Rodchenko was one of many artists whose instincts were curbed by strict guidelines for artistic expression under the Soviet regime. His later work, from the 1930s until his death in 1956, focused on sporting events, parades and other traditional subjects for propaganda. Through June 28, the Palazzo Manin Codroipo in northern Italy is presenting one hundred works from the artist showcasing his subjects, techniques, and inventions. The collection covers his work for magazines, cinema and advertising, as well as an evocative self-caricature from 1922 and many beautiful compositions created with Varvara Stepanova, his partner and companion.  Rodchenko’s early work shows a gifted and daring visual artist, infusing seemingly mundane tableaux with new life. This exhibition strips away the dictates of Socialist Realism to reveal the vivid, thoughtful, unforgettable images for which Rodchenko is known. This post was originally published on HuffPost Italy and was translated into English."
BUSINESS,"WASHINGTON — “Action now is seen as the only safe insurance.”  That was among the many clear warnings that oil giant Shell issued in a film it produced about climate change more than 25 years ago. Many environmentalists, however, argue that the company has largely ignored its own alarm bells. The 1991 film, “Climate of Concern,” resurfaced Tuesday on the Dutch online news outlet The Correspondent. It’s the latest in an ever-growing body of evidence that suggests the oil industry has long known about the climate risks associated with carbon dioxide emissions — and has actively worked to cover them up. “The need to understand the interplay of atmosphere and oceans has been given a new sense of urgency by the realization that our energy-consuming way of life may be causing climatic changes with adverse consequences to us all,” the nearly 30-minute video notes.  The film is eerily prophetic, warning of spiraling global temperatures, a sea level rise that could prove “disastrous,” wetland habitats inundated by salt water and ferocious storm surges brought on by warming ocean temperatures.  “What is now considered abnormal weather could become a new norm,” the film’s narrator says.   “In a crowded world subject to such adverse shifts of climate, who would take care of such greenhouse refugees?” According to The Correspondent, which shared the video with The Guardian, the film was produced for the public eye, particularly for viewing in schools and universities, but has gone largely unseen for many years. In a separate 1986 document reviewed by both publications, Shell reportedly wrote of the uncertainties regarding climate science but noted that “changes may be the greatest in recorded history.” In an interview with The Correspondent, professor Tom Wigley, the former head of the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, which assisted Shell in creating the film, spoke about the accuracy of its predictions.  “It’s amazing it’s 25 years ago,” Wigley said. “It was quite comprehensive on what might happen, what the consequences are, and what we can do about it. I mean, there’s not much more.” Along with linking fossil fuel consumption and rising carbon dioxide emissions to warming global temperatures, the film celebrates renewable energy technologies, including solar and wind. Although Shell does recognize climate change and made investments in wind energy, it is also a key player in the destructive and dirty Canadian tar sands. In an email Tuesday to The Huffington Post, a Shell spokesman said, “Our position on climate change is well known; recognizing the climate challenge and the role energy has in enabling a decent quality of life. Shell continues to call for effective policy to support lower carbon business and consumer choices and opportunities such as government lead carbon pricing/trading schemes.” But environmental groups aren’t convinced that the company has walked the walk when it comes to acting to combat climate change. “The fact that Shell understood all this in 1991, and that a quarter-century later it was trying to open up the Arctic to oil-drilling, tells you all you’ll ever need to know about the corporate ethic of the fossil fuel industry,” Bill McKibben, the co-founder of 350.org, said in a statement. “Shell made a big difference in the world ― a difference for the worse.” In the film (which can be seen in full here), Shell warned that while global warming was not fully understood, “many think that to wait for final proof would be irresponsible.”  “Whether or not the threat of global warming proves as grave as the scientists predict, is it too much to hope that it might act as the stimulus, the catalyst, to a new era of technical and economic cooperation?” the narrator asks. “Our numbers are many and infinitely diverse, but the problems and dilemmas of climatic change concern us all.”"
ENTERTAINMENT,"Kathryn Newton has become especially good at playing the Teen Girl. Even in Masterpiece Theatre’s new “Little Women” miniseries, she portrays Amy, the youngest March sister in the century-old Louisa May Alcott story who burns her sister’s book in a stereotypically claws-out tantrum only teenagers on silver screens can actually get away with. “I said I’d make you pay for being so hateful, and I have,” Amy tells her distraught sister Jo, played by the 19-year-old daughter of actors Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman, Maya Hawke. When Jo subsequently slaps Amy across the face, Newton delivers a high-pitched, pubescent screech like only a veteran actor could. It’s the kind of scene that makes you run to IMDB with several questions: Who is she? How old is she? The answers unfurl: She’s a 21-year-old currently on a Hollywood streak ― “Big Little Lies,” “Halt and Catch Fire,” “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” “Lady Bird,” “Mad Men.” Newton, born and raised in California, is pretty established at this point. She entered the business at the age of 4, appearing on the soap opera “All My Children” until 2003. Five years later, she landed the part of Jay Mohr’s daughter on the CBS sitcom “Gary Unmarried.” “The show was directed by Jim Burrows, so I was working, already, with the greats,” Newton explained over the phone last week. “I learned that I liked that — I liked being surrounded by really smart, interesting [artists].” “I don’t know how I did it,” she added, thinking about how she went from “Gary Unmarried” to acting alongside Reese Witherspoon in 2017. “I just kept doing it. And now, I haven’t really given up.” Over the past two years alone, Newton’s appeared in TV and film as Amy-esque characters who are stuck in the age between carefree and habitually burdened. Joanie in “Halt and Catch Fire,” Claire in “Supernatural,” Abigail in “Big Little Lies,” and Julie in the outrageous Kay Cannon comedy “Blockers.” Playing Leslie Mann’s empowered teenage daughter, she managed to make novel a movie about a pact between girlfriends hellbent on losing their virginities on prom night. “That was one of the best jobs ever because it was three girls, each full-blown characters, who did what they needed to do to stay true to themselves,” she said.  There’s no denying Newton has been typecast as the angsty, intelligent girl who can hold her own alongside adults with careers as long as hers. With a resume as formidable as her much older colleagues, it’s no wonder she emits a self-assurance on- and off-screen. “You don’t have to depend on a director,” Newton told me when we began discussing her acting strategy. “You have so much freedom as an actor in your character’s choices and I really learned to take advantage of that. Jean-Marc [Vallée] was kind of the first director I worked with to introduce that to me. He doesn’t tell you where a camera is going to be; he just shoots, rolls and finds stuff, and you do it over and over again. It was a different kind of filmmaking where I had to learn to be in character for a really long time. Now, I never want to do anything else.” This was the case playing Amy too, a literary character Newton is well aware some fans find less than likable. But she was excited to jump from one female-led cast ― one that annihilated the ratings race and spawned discussions about inclusion and domestic violence ― to a similarly women-dominated set with the Vanessa Caswill-helmed “Little Women.” “I was really excited to share my version of Amy and tell it my way,” she said. “Just as someone who’s read the book, I always saw her as a character who dreams really big, doesn’t like the word no and is going to get what she wanted. And, she does. But as an actor, I learned that she kind of is the unlikable character. So, I had to let my love for her go and let her be misunderstood to then hopefully see that she grows and learns in the end.”  The fact that Amy ages from 12 to 21 in the miniseries ― allowing Newton to leave teenagehood behind toward the end of the show ― was icing on the cake.  “In previous ‘Little Womens,’ they’d hire another actor to play Amy at another age, so [Caswill] took a chance and asked the audience to go with us to that place. That way I got to live in it,” Newton said. “I got to feel how Amy felt; I got to understand why she made that choice to burn Jo’s book; I got to really give it depth, and I think my performance is better.” Newton’s next big-screen role will be Lucy in 2019′s live-action Pokémon movie, “Detective Pikachu,” co-starring Ryan Reynolds, Ken Watanabe and Bill Nighy. Even though it’s family programming, she is eager to be moving on from portraying so-and-so’s teenage daughter.  “It’s probably the most fun I’ve ever had on a job,” she said of “Detective Pikachu.” “I read my character and it just took me over the edge ― like a leading role for someone my age that’s the best one ever. She’s just a character that’s very unforgivably herself and passionate. And I got to grow because we don’t even know who Lucy’s parents are. I’m not just a daughter anymore. She’s her own character, which is really exciting to me, because I’ve never really done that before.” “I always play the daughter,” she continued. “I love those roles because they’re universal stories that everyone can relate to, but it’s a different approach now.” Of course, she’s currently back in California to film “Big Little Lies” Season 2, resuming her most lauded daughter role yet: the progeny of Witherspoon. “Reese Witherspoon made me better. Just working with her, being with her, I learned so much. I want to be like her,” Newton said. “I also feel kind of cool that I was on something that was bigger than just a show. It really sparked a movement for women in all industries, not just film.”  In terms of Abigail’s upcoming storyline, Newton held plot details close to the chest, teasing, “I can’t really say anything except Abigail is staying true to herself and I think that’s really hard to do when you’re in high school and getting older and growing up — it’s really hard to believe in yourself.”  Newton, like Witherspoon, would love to be a producer, eager to write and direct and otherwise wedge herself behind the camera instead of in front of it. “My generation is so motivated to tell their own stories because we have so many that need to be heard,” she said. “I think Hollywood is a really good place to be for women right now ― it’s a big influence and a big reflection of our time. If you have something to say, a movie is a really great medium to say it. It doesn’t matter what the message is.” She enthusiastically added, “I cannot wait for the day when I can call up my friends like Maya [Hawke] or Willa [Fitzgerald] from ‘Little Women’ or Gideon [Adlon] from ‘Blockers’ and be like, ‘Hey, I have this really cool script. Let’s do this.’ Then I get to work with my friends again. That’s my dream.”  The final installment of “Little Women” airs Sunday at 8 p.m. on Masterpiece. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Sara Zielinski recently visited painter Max Ginsburg in his studio to talk about his his politically and emotionally charged paintings. For more than sixty years, Ginsburg has painted from life. In addition to his extensive collection of paintings about the struggle of people in the real world, he has illustrated the covers of hundreds of novels, including A Separate Peace by John Knowles and Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry by Mildred Taylor. Ginsburg's paintings belong to the unique category of Social Realism; they are traditionally painted with exceptional skill and reflect strong social and political views.
Unemployed On Line, Oil on canvas, 40 x 80"", 2013  Your work is classified as social realism. Can you talk a bit about the form?  Social refers to the concepts or subjects of my paintings, which are about life in the real world.   It is about the human conditions that I see and experience on the streets of New York and it is about issues of war and peace, justice and injustice, and, in general, the tragedies as well as the joys in our lives.   The realism of the content is the truthfulness of the social situation.  John Keats said ""Truth is beauty..."" which for me means that it is beautiful to face reality, not to falsify or glamorize or avoid it like so many Germans did in Nazi Germany when they saw Jews disappearing from their neighborhoods or like we do when we fail to speak up or ""blow the whistle"" about injustice fearing for our own insecurity.  The realism of the form is the realistic or natural appearance of the images, especially the human forms. For me, there is an aesthetic beauty of the human form.  As a humanist I cannot accept the mangled abstraction of the human form as seen in much of modern art.

I believe that the realism of form can communicate ideas most effectively.  You paint in a traditional manner, taking cues from masters like Goya and Sorolla, while depicting scenes that speak directly to topical issues, like your recent paintings about foreclosure, Abu Ghraib, and long unemployment lines. Are there artists whom you admire both for their artistic skill and for rebelling through their subject matter?  There are artists whose work I think is beautiful and well-painted.  For example, John Singer Sargent is a masterful painter, but he was painting a different reality, that of an aristocratic world. I identify much more with painters like Dagnan-Bouveret and Jean-Francois Millet  who painted French peasants naturalistically and Joaquin Sorolla y Bastida who expressed in his paintings a strong earthy feeling for ordinary Spanish people.  The Russian painter Ilya Repin and the American painter Winslow Homer also expressed the reality of life of ordinary people in a realistic and skillful manner. On the other hand I admire Francisco De Goya for his anti-war expressions, Disasters of War.  But in my painting Torture Abu Ghraib, I am only partially inspired by Disasters of War. In terms of skillfully painted form, it was the Crucifixion paintings of the Old Masters, especially Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, that inspired me.
Torture Abu Ghraib, Oil on canvas, 48 x 32"", 2009  Your work and my work are very different in many ways, but we both use people as our primary subjects. Where does your interest in the human form and human expression come from?  My interest in ""human expression"" comes from my high regard for humanity or the people.  As a student, I learned about democratic values and justice for all.  These values have entered into my art.  So when I see injustice and hypocrisy I express my outrage and conversely I express joy when I see positive human experiences.  I have been influenced by many of the Old Masters regarding their expressions about life.  Kaethe Kollwitz's etching of a man holding a child and the mother proudly observing the relationship is a beautiful and positive portrayal of life.  On the other hand she expressed tragedy in her lithograph of a woman searching a battlefield for her dead son. As for the ""human form,"" there is a beauty in the human form.  I find it aesthetically beautiful as an art form.  When this form is abstracted or even badly drawn, it is dehumanized.  Observing the uniqueness of the human form every time I paint the model is my artistic goal.  Painting this form naturalistically most truly reflects its reality.
War Pieta, Oil on canvas, 50 x 60"", 2007  Let's talk about War Pieta. This image is so powerful. Can you talk about your motivations behind making this painting? Why a pieta?  The Iraq War was an unjust, devastating inhuman horror.  My painting, War Pieta, of a mother in anguish over the loss of her son singularly symbolized the horror of war.  I felt the Pieta image of the Madonna mourning the death of her son Jesus would resonate with the predominantly Christian American public.  So I used this imagery in the contemporary setting of the Iraq War.  I also wanted to address the hypocrisy of our former President George Bush who claimed to be devoutly religious and then lied to the American people about the reasons for starting the war.   The symbolism of the burning oil fields was to address the real reason for the war, which was ""blood for oil.""

BUSINESS,"Through six months of Donald Trump the progressive resistance has been united by opposition to his policies.  The good news is that we have stopped his legislative program.  The bad news is that most Americans don't understand what progressives stand for, other than opposing Trump.  Now's the time to bring forward an  agenda that emphasizes safety. During the next six months, Trump won't change.  He'll continue to lie, bloviate, and feather his own nest.  His racism and resentment will become more obvious.   And congressional Republicans will careen from issue to issue without challenging Trump or accomplishing anything of significance. This six-month period provides a golden opportunity for progressives and Democrats, in general, to tell voters what they stand for.  So far, the results have been underwhelming. Democrats have responded with ""A Better Deal."" (https://democrats.senate.gov/abetterdeal/#.WZGuAHeGOE0)  Washington Progressives have their own ""Progressive Agenda."" (http://www.21stcenturydems.org/index/the-progressive-agenda-in-13-steps/#.WZGiCHeGOE3)  Both documents are too complicated.  They follow the losing HRC prescription: ""when in doubt hand the voter a policy paper."" An affective progressive agenda should contain only a handful of objectives. And, hopefully, one or two memorable phrases. Affordable Healthcare:  The obvious place for progressives to begin is with healthcare.  The resistance has beaten back Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  Progressives believe in strengthening Obamacare and expanding Medicaid into the 19 states that do not have it. We should aim higher.  Progressives should advocate Medicare for All; a concept easy to remember.  We stand for safety through the democratization of healthcare. Economic Equality: Most Americans believe the system is rigged.  61 percent feel ""the country is headed in the wrong direction.""  Voters continue to rank ""the economy"" as the number one problem. While the stock market is booming and total employment is at record levels, most Americans do not believe capitalism is working for them.  Consumer-credit is at near-record levels; Americans carry more than $1 trillion in credit-card debt. The Progressive Agenda offers a thirteen-point proposal ""to restore an economy that works for working Americans.”  While they are all good important, progressives need to identify one or two memorable ideas that differentiate them from Republicans.  Two suggestions: Feature the slogan: Give America a raise.  The Progressive Agenda suggests: ""Raise the federal minimum wage, so that it reaches $15/hour, while indexing it to inflation.""  Republicans have shown no interest in this measure but it's one that resonates with most voters.  (A recent poll [http://thehill.com/homenews/335837-poll-bipartisan-majority-supports-raising-minimum-wage ] found that 74 percent of respondents favored raising the minimum wage.) Safety through better wages. The second suggestion is adopt the slogan: Make Capitalism work for everyone.  One of the unnoticed sections of ""A Better Deal"" is the section on ""Cracking Down on Corporate Monopolies"" (https://democrats.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/A-Better-Deal-on-Competition-and-Costs-1.pdf) which states: This break up monopolies stance represents a dramatic change from previous Democratic platforms.  It differentiates progressives from Republicans and is an issue that resonates with voters in general -- for example, a 2015 poll found that a majority of Americans favored breaking up the largest financial institutions. Of course there are many other issues that could be featured in a progressive agenda; among these are climate change, immigration, reproductive rights, and criminal justice to mention only a few.  Rather than add another issue to the three already mentioned, it would be more productive for the progressive agenda to focus on values. The place to start is with safety.   America is a great country but American democracy is not working for everyone.  We need look no farther than the Charlottesville violence, or the number of voters that believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, to understand that Americans are not satisfied with the status quo. Donald Trump won the presidency because his slogan, ""make America great again,"" resonated with more voters than did Hillary Clinton's slogan, ""stronger together."" Trump's slogan, ""make America great again,"" was interpreted by many of his supporters as, ""let's return to the fifties when America was number one in the world and white men called all the shots.""  Clinton's tepid slogan was interpreted as ""let's keep doing what Obama has been doing,"" an endorsement of the status quo. Progressives need an effective alternative to ""make America great again.""  Make America safe again.  This reflects the reality that because of economic inequality and Donald Trump, most Americans are fearful.  They fear for the future because the economy is not working for them and they do not have adequate healthcare, education, or housing.  Many Americans fear for the future because of climate change. In addition, the Charlottesville violence reminds us that many Americans are fearful because of the color of their skin, or their gender/sexual orientation, or their religion or country of origin.  Donald Trump has brought bigotry and hate into the mainstream.  He has legitimized the politics of resentment. It's time for progressives to stand up to Trump's hate-filled conduct and proclaim to all Americans: We will make America safe again."

The reedy, plaintive cry of the mizmar undulates through the air while hands beat drums with languorous rhythms. Ahead of the musicians, four men, impeccably dressed in high street fashion, lead the funeral procession with heads held high. But they don't walk in mournful solemnity. They strut. Every so often one will open his jacket, revealing the label, calling attention to the finery of his suit. Parading through the city thus, the people of Sharjah joined in, following the procession or watching from balconies, as the men wound their way through the streets, finally congregating in Calligraphy Square.  Uriel Barthélémi, Souls' Landscapes: The great mantle of night which has enveloped us...,2015. Commissioned by Sharjah Art Foundation. Courtesy of the artist.

The performance, Fanfare funérailles (funeral brass), conceptualized and performed by the Congolese dancer and choreographer Papy Ebotani, and based on a text by young Congolese writer and choreographer Dorine Mokha, took place on March 6 as one of the opening events of the 12th Sharjah Biennial. The rituals of the funerary procession here provide a showcase for the rites of the adherents to a dandy-ish Congolese subculture known as les sapeurs, or Societe des Ambianceurs et des Personnes Elegantes (the Society of Tastemakers and Elegant People), forming a kind of resistance, however fashionable, to the pain, grief, oppression, or impoverishment of daily life. Ebotani's performance incorporated traditional North African instrumentation and Congolese pop culture (the performers included rapper Shoggy Angoy, sapeur Lesasa Jocker and comedian Gaylor Yogolelo), the rites of death with the social rites of the living, and the residents of the city with the visitors to the Biennial, all taking place on the streets of Sharjah. As one UAE-based art critic described it, ""With this brilliant performance, the Biennial came to the city and the city came to the Biennial. Visitors were suddenly part of the streets and residents were drawn for a moment into the art world.""  Eduardo Navarro, XYZ, 2015. Commissioned by Sharjah Art Foundation. Courtesy of the artist.

Eungie Joo, curator of the ""Sharjah Biennial 12: The past, the present, the possible,"" set out to bring the Biennial into the city, with performances occupying the streets and site-specific installations inhabiting interstitial, iconic and derelict spaces of Sharjah. Henri Lefebvre's 1967 essay ""The Right to the City"" inspired the exhibition's title and curatorial premise, which looks to Sharjah as a city full of potential and possibility, ""a city and emirate still in the process of imagining itself through education, culture, religion, heritage and science."" Joo's Biennial spreads throughout Sharjah, investing new meanings and possibilities into an old city, where humans have been living for 125,000 years. ""It is a city imagining a new city,"" said Joo.  Nikhil Chopra, Use Like Water, 2015. Commissioned by Sharjah Art Foundation. Courtesy of the artist. Image courtesy of Sharjah Art Foundation.

The human presence is strongly felt in this biennial, particularly during its opening days with a great number of performances taking place throughout the city incorporating music, singing, dance, and play. Argentinian artist Eduardo Navarro developed a game with local children, involving the manipulation of a massive blue ball, which was performed in a courtyard in Al Hamdan Bin Mousa Square. French composer and musician Uriel Barthélémi presented a striking three-part performance with a troupe of dancers, actors, and visual artists. And Faustin Linyekula, Congolese singer, dancer and leader of the Kisangani-based contemporary dance company Studios Kabako (of which Papy Ebotani is also a member), delivered Le Cargo, a highly personal solo performance comprising dance mixed with storytelling.

Many of the artists invited to participate in the Biennial took up residence in Sharjah for extended periods of time, letting the environment prompt new commissions and site-specific interventions. Rirkrit Tiravanija constructed an elaborate rose garden within the courtyard of the Calligraphers' Studios, outfitting it with a rosewater distillery and kitchen, where visitors are invited to eat fragrant rosewater delicacies while relaxing atop ottomans in the lounge. Nikhil Chopra undertook a nine-day performance, entitled Use Like Water, beginning with one of his large-scale drawings at the Bait Obaid Al Shamsi, and ending with a transcendent performance as the artist, dressed in silver slippers and a white gauze-like garb illuminated from beneath by LED lights, glided from the interior of the studio and along the waterfront promenade at sunset to a rapt audience.

The sharp and arid landscape of Sharjah, between desert and sea, sun and shadow, provides impetus for two of the Biennial's most striking site-specific installations. In a courtyard of the Sharjah Art Foundation, Taro Shinoda has constructed a meditative karesansui, or Japanese rock garden, composed of white and black gravel framing an expanse of perfectly smooth, flat white sand. Two precisely carved depressions punctuate the plane of sand and a wooden platform offers viewers a sheltered space from which to contemplate the landscape. Nearby, Brazilian artist Cinthia Marcelle's installation, At the Risk of the Real, also hinges upon the element of desert sand, but here it is a dynamic material, rather than a silent object of meditation. Sand comes tumbling down over the heads of visitors, shaken through the mesh screens that make up an incomplete roof by the footsteps of workers on the simple wooden framework overhead.

The derelict roof is somewhat of a common sight in the spaces of the Sharjah Biennial: some of the interventions by Biennial artists are serving to christen once abandoned ruins to serve as new art spaces in the city and beyond. Hassan Khan has taken over the iconic yet vacant ""Flying Saucer"" building in Sharjah with a colorful installation inaugurating what will become a permanent exhibition space of the Sharjah Art Foundation. And Adrián Villar Rojas's installation, evoking the cycles of death, decomposition, and rebirth, takes place in the immense abandoned Kalba Ice Factory, located about a two-hour drive from Sharjah on the opposite end of the peninsula, another space acquired by the Foundation, designated for restoration, and destined for the production and presentation of further art works.

POLITICS,"Democrats are planning to make Washington corruption a central focus of their midterm messaging, reviving a successful theme from when they took control of Congress in 2006.  The anti-corruption push is the second part of Democrats’ “A Better Deal” platform. The first part, released last summer, focused on an economic agenda. The newest part is “A Better Deal for Our Democracy,” which puts forward proposals to increase access to the ballot box, fight special interests and combat big money through campaign finance reform.  The new initiative will center on both President Donald Trump’s administration and the culture in Congress that gives access to lobbyists and corporations. Trump’s Cabinet officials, including Environmental Protection Agency leader Scott Pruitt and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, have drawn a torrent of negative headlines over allegations of unethical behavior, travel practices and ties to special interests. The president’s hotel in downtown D.C., in particular, has been the subject of several lawsuits. Congress has to rein in the excesses of the executive branch, Democrats argue, and the current crop of Republican leaders aren’t going to do it.  Democrats unveiled their agenda Monday during a press conference on Capitol Hill. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) were joined by other lawmakers who have been working on these issues, including Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). “President Trump has become the swamp and Americans are paying the price. The American people deserve better,” Pelosi said at the press conference, citing the Trump administration’s failure to reduce the price of prescription drugs and its repeal of numerous Obama-era regulations concerning air and water. Schumer similarly lamented that Trump had failed to take on the powerful pharmaceutical industry, which is something he promised to do while on the campaign trail. The Senate minority leader also pointed to the president’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, as an example of how influence peddling and special interests had consumed the Trump administration. Following the 2016 election, Cohen leveraged his relationship with Trump to receive millions of dollars from companies eager for insight into his administration. “The swamp has never been more foul than under this president,” Schumer said. Democrats said they would bring accountability and transparency back to Washington by providing aggressive oversight of the Trump administration and by toughening the nation’s campaign finance laws in order to stem the flow of anonymous political spending known as dark money. This focus on corruption is a revival of the party’s successful messaging from the 2006 elections, when Democrats took control of the House and Senate from Republicans. They hammered away at the GOP’s “culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence.” In that election cycle, the GOP was besieged by scandals amongst House members. The most famous was the Mark Foley scandal, which involved Republican congressman from Florida sending sexually explicit text messages to teenage boys. When that news broke in September 2006, Republicans knew they were doomed. But other scandals had been dripping out bit by bit in the prior months.  “Choking your mistress. Touching little boys. Taking money from the Russians. Questionable business dealings,” said a GOP strategist who worked at the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2006 and requested anonymity to speak candidly. “You name it, we had it. On and on, never ended.” Pelosi has been testing out the anti-corruption message since at least April; for example, she went after Pruitt for being “a part of the Trump Administration’s culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence.”  But it remains to be seen how much of this push will actually trickle down to the districts. While Democratic candidates have been talking about the tax law and its benefits for big corporations and lobbyists, they so far have not been focusing on Trump and the problems in his administration. It’s rare to hear candidates talk about Trump in swing districts, with much more of the focus there resting on policy issues such as health care and gun control. This article has been updated with comment from Monday’s press conference. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Dressed in his signature black tee-shirt, jeans, leather belt with silver grommets, black boots, and matching discrete hoop earrings, Marvin J. Taylor, Director of the Fales Library and Special Collections at New York University looks very much like the quintessential downtown dweller. Someone who is at home walking the streets south of 14th Street, the cobblestones of Greenwich Village and SoHo and the black-top of the Lower East Side.  A native of Indiana, who first studied music (organ) at Indiana University in Bloomington and then switched to Comparative Literature and a Masters in Library Science, Taylor fell in with the punk band kids (many of them studio artists), long before he arrived in New York City. The first piece of downtown literature he read, given to him by his partner was Words in Reverse (1979) by Laurie Anderson, which presented texts from her performance pieces, where words, graphics, and minimal music merge in provocative non-linear ways.  By the time Taylor arrived at Fales in 1993, the library already had an Avant-Garde Collection of Beat and New York School poetry and a modest fiction collection of about 500 linear feet. Taylor's timing was perfect.  It was a heady moment for the university which was in the process of remaking itself as new disciplines began to proliferate: area studies, and gender studies. It was also the heady days of queer theory. Taylor thought about what he could do to make Fales and NYU unique and, spurred on by his ties to the activist community, one year later, in 1994, founded the Downtown Collection, which has now grown to 12,000 linear feet of archives, all but 3,000 of them already processed. The collection, which now includes vinyl,  is so extensive that half of it is currently off-site, in a temperature and humidity controlled building in Putnam Country. A retrieval system is already in place.  Featured currently in the Fales Gallery space is Martha Wilson: Downtown, an exhibit drawn from Wilson's personal papers, one of 435 collections housed in the Downtown's comprehensive, controversial, and some might say, cantankerous archive. The gift of 80 boxes of material in 2007, Martha Wilson, said came quite naturally: ""I felt like my experience as a downtown person should be preserved by Downtown.""  Beyond their downtown identification, Wilson, an American feminist performance artist and the founding director of Franklin Furnace, said that she and Taylor shared the need, the urge to break out of the constraint of categories. In a journal entry by Wilson from the fall of 1998, she speaks of meeting Taylor: ""Marvin and I come from the same point of view,"" Wilson wrote, adding that ""Marvin is breaking down the divisions between libraries and museums. They both collect and catalog objects."" Given their strong sense of history and community, both Wilson and Taylor were natural archivists.  For Wilson, who founded Franklin Furnace, a not-for-profit arts organization whose mission was to ""present, preserve, interpret, proselytize and advocate on behalf of avant-garde art"" in Tribeca in 1976, the breaking down of divisions resonated deeply. Wilson's artists were ""doing pieces,"" not making art. The medium was to be appropriate to the idea. ""If Christy Rupp wanted to make posters of rats and post them on a curb that was OK. The next project could have been made out of chicken bones,"" Wilson quipped.   Official categories were for the convenience of the funders and the art historians who were looking at the downtown scene in a formal way. Wilson and Taylor both knew that the real situation was more fluid. Taylor once said that, ""Everybody was in three bands."" Wilson, however, was only in one, Disband, a group that made everything up as it went along and used strange props such as radios and rocking chairs.  To Wilson, the Downtown Collection was a ""poifect fit!"" Marvin Taylor not only shared her love and appreciation for the creative life of downtown New York City but he also came from a Quaker background, much like her own. ""The Quakers never threw anything out,"" Wilson said. ""The idea was to save a chair from generation to generation; to preserve something because it will mean different things to different people over time."" This appealed strongly to Wilson who said that she was once criticized for saving ticket stubs.  To Taylor, his Quaker heritage added another dimension beyond thriftiness:  living a life of self- reflection. It was a quality that Taylor saw immediately when he read Wilson's journal entries. ""She was trying to figure out the way she was supposed to be as a woman in the 70s. It was difficult being a strong woman in the arts,"" he said.  Taylor first saw Martha Wilson's work at a small gallery in Chelsea where he fell in love with her early, gender-bending work. ""Way before Cindy Sherman,"" he said, ""Wilson realized that gender is performance identity is conceptual art."" Taylor followed Wilson's career and, in the intervening years, they worked together on various boards and on the Artists Space Archives project now housed at Bard.  Always introspective, Wilson began to question things as they were. For one thing, there was the wisdom of having the largest collection in the United States of artist books made of paper housed in a loft constructed of wood. The decision was made in 1993 to sell the books to MoMA who asked for three copies of each work. MoMA kept the first copy (now stored in their Queens warehouse), sold the second copy to a book dealer, and returned the third copy (if any) to Franklin Furnace. Although the third set is incomplete, it is now housed in their Brooklyn office, leaving them with a ""pretty respectable research collection."" For another, when Wilson turned 65, there was the question she asked herself: What will happen in 100 years? ""It was lucky for me,"" Wilson said, ""that so many Franklin Furnace alumni were on the Pratt Faculty. When Jennifer Miller went to speak to her dean, he loved the idea of our nesting at Pratt; he loved the idea of having a living and breathing arts institution inside the school.""  Two years of negotiations ensued, with Franklin Furnace becoming an organization-in-residence at Pratt Institute in September 2014, with their moving their office and collections to Pratt in December, and with their official opening set for April 1st  2015. After so many moves, from its original home on Franklin Street in Tribeca, to John Street, to 80 Hanson Place (in the BAM arts cultural center), Wilson is relieved that Franklin Furnace has a new, permanent home at Pratt on Willoughby Avenue.  Wilson is clear about the future. ""We remain independent organizations. The idea is that the students will have access to our artists and programs, and we will have access to their students and infrastructure."" Although Pratt and Franklin Furnace recently applied jointly for funding to integrate their artist book collections electronically and physically--the ownership would not change.  Beyond their shift across the East River, however, Franklin Furnace has accomplished an even greater transformation in the virtual realm. With substantial grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities, they have succeeded in publishing their events and records (slides, black and white photos, press releases, announcement cards and posters) online up through 1996. A third grant, for which they have already applied, will cover the decade 1996-2006. ""Now people can see the Karen Finley presentation in their pajamas!"" Wilson said.  Taylor is particularly pleased that, although Franklin Furnace's archive has found an institutional home at Pratt, both Wilson's personal papers (2007) and the Franklin Furnace Ephemera Collection (2008) are now in the Downtown Collection. The Ephemera Collection serves as an index, as a way of looking at the downtown scene internationally. Founded by Wilson's archivist Matthew Hogan, it consists of all of the flyers, press releases, and announcement cards sent to Franklin Furnace over the years from 149 institutions worldwide. Although Taylor was always interested in the Franklin Furnace archive coming to Fales, he fully understands the decision to house it at Pratt. ""Wilson wants it to live on,"" he said, ""As an art school, Pratt has more flexibility. It is harder to be an on-going thing here."" Taylor and Wilson collaborated on the Martha Wilson: Downtown show at Fales, which together with the Performing Franklin Furnace exhibit, featuring 30 projects from the Franklin Furnace archive currently at the Pratt Manhattan Gallery, was organized by the Independent Curators International (ICI) and initiated by curator Peter Dykhuis. ""The idea was to exhibit me as a complete person,"" Wilson said, ""with half the show focused on Martha Wilson as an artist brain and the other half on Martha Wilson as an administrator."" Martha performed at many of the venues, appearing in Los Angeles in her Barbara Bush persona.  At Fales, Wilson and Taylor installed images from her early performing art in the long corridor. There is A Portfolio of Models from 1974 with Martha as Housewife, Working Girl, Professional, Earth-Mother, and Lesbian: Martha in a curly wig with a can of soda, short skirt, and high heels; Martha in a plain dress, simple cardigan and sensible shoes; and Martha in a satin jumpsuit.  ""At one time or another, I have tried them all on for size and none has fit,"" the wall text announces. ""All that's left to do is be an artist and point the finger at my own predicament. The artist operates out of the vacuum left when all other values are rejected."" At the end of the hall, there is a full size image of Martha Wilson as Tipper Gore. Why Tipper? During the Clinton years, Wilson watched the MTV inaugural ball video where Bill Clinton came out playing the sax, then Hillary, followed by Al Gore and Tipper. ""The mood in the room changed when Tipper arrived. ""They booed her off the stage,"" Wilson said, explaining that Tipper advocated placing a parental advising label on video. ""Tipper's advice for the 1990s was just let me decide what is obscene and your work will sell like hot cakes."" Wilson said.  Inside the larger space at Fales, there are vitrines with Wilson's daily diaries and a video by Britta Wheeler of ""A Day in the Life of Martha Wilson,"" a series of photographs taken by Wheeler and accompanied by Martha reading excerpts from her journals. The journal entries chosen for the exhibit are bold and uncensored. ""I was trying to be as honest as possible,"" Wilson said, admitting that this is the first time that these journal entries have ever been on view. ""But so far no one is mad at me.""  Certainly not Marvin Taylor who is thrilled that Wilson's journals are on display in his space and who transformed the gallery from one that housed a permanent installation to one that showcases materials drawn from the collection in 1995. From the start, Taylor understood artists' papers as being very different and he shrewdly built upon the foundation of NYU's collection of beat writers by networking extensively. By 1994, he had found his niche: downtown archival material from the 1970s and 1980s, especially important because the AIDS crisis had decimated the arts scene.  A friend directed him to Ron Kolm who had worked at various bookstores including the Spring Street Bookstore and who had lots of signed copies by writers. An admirer of Between C & D, an experimental and graphic publication, he added their papers to the archive.   Most archives consisted of printed materials although the C& D cache arrived with the Downtown Collection's first digital remnants, floppy disks.  Donated to Fales by individuals and estates, the Downtown Collection grew in size and reputation, often by word-of-mouth but also often by dint of Taylor's extensive networking.  One such example is the David Wojnarowicz's papers, which came to Fales in 1997. Taylor knew Robert Sember, a graduate student, who provided him with an introduction to Tom Rauffenbart, Wojnarowicz's partner. ""When I first visited the collection in storage on 17th Street,"" Taylor said, ""I saw ""The Magic Box"" and immediately understood that it was important for understanding David's practice.  So, I accepted it along with other objects David had collected."" It was a major breakthrough for Taylor because it changed his thinking about what archives can be, especially artists' papers. Heavily used by researchers, the Downtown Collection today offers graduate students, in search of unique doctoral dissertation topics, and curators, impassioned by the growing trend to include original archival material in their exhibits, a treasure trove of printed matter and objects. The list is extraordinary, some might even say eclectic and exotic: there are papers from such downtown luminaries as Richard Foreman, E.L. Doctorow, Jack Gelber, Pete Hamill, Richard Hell, Frank Moore, Gary Indiana, and David Wojnarowicz; and archives from such in-your-face innovators as Gay and Lesbian Pulp Fiction, the A.I.R. Gallery, the Guerrilla Girls, Go Nightclubbing, Inc, Outpunk, and Creative Time.  Steeped in reading Foucault and Eve Sedgwick, a modernist who criticized the way libraries handled Queer material, Taylor and Evelyn Ehrlich, to whom he reported, understood that librarians had to become more allied with archivists.   The Downtown Show: The New York Art Scene 1974-1984 held in 2006 was a turning point for Taylor. In collaboration with the Grey Gallery at NYU and its director Lynn Gumbert, the exhibit recognized that archival objects had enough agency to stand on their own. The collaboration was synergistic, especially given Grey's history. Two years before the opening of MoMA in 1929, NYU was home to the A.E. Gallatin Museum of Living Art (1927-1943), a space developed to showing living artists. When NYU administrators decided to convert the gallery space into a library processing facility, the Gallatin Collection was sold to the Philadelphia Museum. Subsequently, Howard Conant and a group of artists and dealers began the NYU collection in 1958.  Currently housed in Grey, it consists of about 6,000 pieces and is especially strong in the NY School from the 1950s and 1960s. The collaboration between Grey and Fales was fortuitous and it cemented their mutual interest. ""Marvin Taylor and I realized that ""we shared a similar interest in looking at a broader overview of the arts -at a dissolution of boundaries,"" Gumbert said. ""Marvin is so visionary,"" she said.  ""I always have enjoyed the notion of supporting materials. We foreground them.""  Although Gumbert admitted to a minor curatorial disagreement with Taylor, who likes to line things up straight in the vitrines while she often prefers to fan materials out, she said that they agree on basics. Both are passionate about revealing the interior voyages of artists. ""It is a way,"" Gumbert said,  ""of getting a broader understanding of art and its context and how it circulates."" In a sequel, Downtown Pix: Mining the Archives, (2010) another collaboration between Fales and Grey, they hired Philip Gefter, a photo curator, to go through the Fales photo archives to create a show. On the lower level of the Grey Gallery, they added snapshots by Andy Warhol, from the NYU collection. Subsequent collaborations have included Fluxus at NYU: Before and Beyond, which was conceived of as a companion to Fluxus and the Essential Questions of Life, a traveling show from Dartmouth, and Toxic Beauty: The Art of Frank Moore (2012. Scheduled for January, 2017 is a future collaboration, Inventing Downtown: Artist Run Galleries in New York City, 1952-1963, which will be curated by Melissa Rachleff. Today the competition to obtain archives has heated up and Fales goes up against the well-endowed Getty Foundation and Yale for archival material. Still, Taylor was there first and Gumbert believes that Taylor and Fales have ""not yet received the recognition that they deserve."" That's only partially true, though. When Alexander Campos, Director of the Center for Book Arts, introduced Taylor recently at a panel that Taylor was moderating there on archives, he noted Taylor's impressive official bio.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Yuni Kim Lang doesn't just make sculpture, she makes live sculpture.  The Korean-American artist's signature artwork, ""Comfort Hair,"" doesn't come with a tiny beating heart, if that's what you're thinking. The ""live"" modifier refers to the fact that the sculpture is more performance that stationary object. The piece requires a person -- a wearer -- to make the work whole. And when wearer meets sculpture, meaning pours forth. The massive pile of dark, woven hair becomes a totem of cultural identity, and a visual reminder of history's obsession with long flowing locks.  ""Comfort Hair"" was inspired by the Korean practice of wearing a gache, a large, heavy wig typically found on the heads of wealthy, high society women. Like these raven-hued fixtures that epitomized the ""bigger is better"" mantra, Lang's sculpture appears like a massive pile of hair made from polypropylene rope that sits atop a model's head for one hour at a time.  The gache is just one historical example that illuminates humanity's greater obsession with manes, mops, curls and tresses. Over the centuries, ""hair has symbolized so many different things,"" Lang told The Huffington Post, despite the fact that the only ""living"" portion of hair remains hidden inside the follicle. ""The obsession we have with our dead hair that we imagine to be full of life is fascinating. It is the part of the body that has no nerves or muscles but has movements and rhythm that feel alive. When you cut it off there is no pain and it does not bleed. Yet, we perceive it as a sacred entity.""  While history at large has undoubtedly obsessed over hair -- from yesterday's Victorian wigs to today's Instagrammable cuts -- hair is, of course, as much a personal experience as it is a shared one. ""'Comfort Hair' was conceived because of the way I was brought up, as a third culture kid,"" Lang explained. Third culture kid (TCK), she elaborated, is a term used to refer to people who have spent a significant amount of their developmental years in cultures other than the ones they were born into. ""Being a Korean growing up in China, going to an American International school, I was sorting through three different cultures to makes sense out of my own. The amalgamation of these three cultures has become my personal cultural identity."" According to Lang, the thing that makes the TCK experience so unique is that it involves tough questions regarding personal cultural identity -- even confusion -- at a very early stage in your life. For Lang, this first happened when she was three years old. ""It is truly unique in the sense that these individuals are moving between cultures before they even have the opportunity to fully develop their personal and cultural identity,"" she said.   After each ""Comfort Hair"" performance, Lang tells us, the wearer ceremoniously sheds the gache-esque work. ""The action of shedding the hair piece is like shedding a layer of skin,"" she added. It’s the same idea behind a reptile shedding its skin regularly to allow room for growth. ""The main reason for shedding is that their older skin does not grow with them, so in order to grow they need to shed the old, allowing the new skin to form below the old one. This is the idea behind the performance. Our identities are ever evolving and growing and it is a crucial part of the growth that we also shed a layer of us behind."" ""I fantasize about my hair,"" Lang concluded. ""It stands in for my cultural identity which is becoming an organism that continues to grow and prosper. Hair is always personal and my work is definitely very personal."" Photographs of ""Comfort Hair"" will be on view at John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, as part of the ""Towards Textiles"" exhibition, until Oct. 11, 2015."
BUSINESS,"New CEO, same old problem. Uber lost $4.5 billion in 2017 and posted sales of just under $7.5 billion, the ride-hailing company told investors Tuesday. The loss was 61 percent more than the year before, according to data obtained by CNBC. Despite the eye-popping figures, Uber is making headway on slowing the bleeding. Uber, a private company, doesn’t have to publicly disclose earnings. But The Wall Street Journal, which reviewed the company’s figures, reported Uber increased sales by at least 10 percent every quarter in 2017. In the fourth quarter ― the first three-month period under new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi ― the company increased the total value of all its fares 60 percent from the prior year, to $11.06 billion. Bloomberg notes Uber ended 2017 with about $6 billion in cash on hand, 13 percent less than the year earlier.  Last month, Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. acquired a roughly 15-percent stake in the company, giving it a fresh infusion of cash and becoming Uber’s largest shareholder. Khosrowshahi said previously he wants to take the company public by 2019, which means Uber eventually will have to pull back the curtain on details of its financial performance. Complicating matters, the company has been without a chief financial officer since 2015. Uber’s tumultuous 2017 included the exit of former CEO Travis Kalanick, whose tenure was marked by controversies that included sexual harassment and discrimination, and questionable business practices."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Everbody Knows . . . Elizabeth Murray premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival's closing weekend. Even as the artist Elizabeth Murray was making news, installing the major retrospective of her extraordinary sculptural paintings at MoMA in 2005, one of 4 women so respectfully displayed, room after room on MoMA's 6th floor galleries, she was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. Film production designer Kristi Zea was already making a documentary about her and her prolific career. Unlike writer Nora Ephron, say, who made the decision to keep her illness under wraps, Murray was open about the disease that she would fight valiantly working at her studio. And now Zea had a theme for her documentary: ""The tone of the movie changed. Suddenly we had a story we did not know we had. What I found out,"" said Kristi Zea just before the film's premiere screening at the Whitney Museum, part of the Tribeca Film Festival, ""was how much people loved her. She was ambitious, didn't take no for an answer. 'Everybody knows' was the name of her last painting. That has so many connotations: everybody knows that I am sick, everybody knows me but they don't."" In fact, Elizabeth Murray is not as well known as many of her contemporaries: Eric Fishl, David Salle, Julian Schnabel, a point that is perplexing to Zea, and a feminist issue, begging the question, ""how does a woman have a household and passion for creative artistic expression that she needs to do while she is juggling all these things. Murray did not stop up until the end."" She met Murray about 25 years ago when Zea was planning a Mormon opera with JoAnne Akalaitis. They went to Utah for research and tacked on a hiking trip. Akalaitis invited Elizabeth Murray to join them. Zea said, ""We would dish and download,"" of their excursions into Bryce Canyon and other locations. ""We were working at art, and had kids and husbands."" Inspired by Jonathan Demme's Neil Young documentary, Heart of Gold, and Martin Scorsese's documentary, No Direction Home: Bob Dylan, Zea asked Murray if she could do a piece on her, and was initially funded by The Warhol Foundation giving her $75,000. Murray's husband, poet Bob Holman contributed archival material. Joel Shapiro, Chuck Close, and Richard Serra gave art for an auction to help fund this film. James L. Brooks sent money. Still, Zea juggled: ""I have a very good career as a production designer and I would go off and do a movie and then come back to do this. The movie became a labor of love."" The sold-out Whitney Museum opening would be a big deal, with art world luminaries expected, including the Guerilla Girls, incognito. But says Zea, I want everyone to see this movie: ""Women have to try to get over hurdles. Women have to persevere. I dedicated this film to my daughter. The message of the film: You are on the planet for a good reason."" A version of this post also appears on Gossip Central."
ARTS & CULTURE,"London--Comparisons might be odious, but Kenneth Branagh invites them.  Over several decades he's assumed classic roles associated with Laurence Olivier.  His Henry V and Hamlet were unquestionably Olivier-worthy.  Now, however, he's playing Archie Rice (for another two weeks) in John Osborne's The Entertainer, at the Garrick and as the conclusion to his Kenneth Branagh Theatre Company year. It could be argued that Archie Rice was the great performance of Olivier's later career.  I'd certainly make that argument vigorously.  As the aging music hall performer, Olivier--frequently at his best when playing a ham (watch him in Sleuth, for instance--pulled out every last stop.  His Archie Rice was someone far past his prime, a prime that probably was not much of a prime anyway.  His on-setting desperation was visible in the song-and-dance routine that began the play. Branagh starts with a deft tap routine executed in Neil Austin's hazy lighting and augmented by four dancing cuties.  Immediately, Archie Rice's cheap turn, as Osborne plants it, is fudged.  That's the start of director Rob Ashford's undercutting the playwright's music-hall metaphor--of the fading post-World War II music hall as a metaphor for the United Kingdom's post-war fade. Yes, it looks as if Ashford, who started his career as a choreographer, is the explanation for this misguided look at The Entertainer, although since Branagh and he have been a team for a while now, Branagh can surely be assumed to be in agreement with all decisions made.  (Chris Bailey and Pip Jordan are credited as, respectively choreographer and associate choreographer of the numbers.)  Osborne alternates the song-and-dance turns (Branagh has a strong voice, though he's not always pitch-perfect, perhaps deliberately) with Archie at home alongside his accommodating wife Phoebe (Greta Scacchi, very effective), father Billy Rice (Gawn Grainger, still an on-stage powerhouse), son Frank (Jonah Hauer-King) and nubile Jean Rice (Sophie McShera) for whom Archie makes a baleful play. Somehow, these sequences seem diluted as well, the view of a troubled England surprisingly pallid.  Perhaps 60 years on, Osborne's script is partially responsible for the lack of urgency.  Nevertheless, the overall result is disappointing. What's no letdown is Christopher Oram's set which melds the music hall with the Rice home so that at no time is Archie's squalid professional life absent from the mundane family activity.

Kemp Powers's One Night in Miami... has already played Baltimore, Denver and Los Angeles, but it may be the sold-out Donmar Warehouse entry, directed by Baltimore Center Stage artistic director Kwame Kwei-Armeh, that guarantees Manhattan and across-the-land sightings. It's 1963 and Cassius Clay (Sope Dirisu) has just defeated Sonny Liston for the world heavyweight title.  He's returned to his hotel room to celebrate with good pals Sam Cooke (Arinzé Kene), Jim Brown (David Ajala) and Malcolm X (Francois Battiste), while Nation of Islam guards Kareem (Dwane Walcott) and Jamaal (Josh Williams) keep watch in the corridor. Don't look here for confirmation of the personnel present on that historic evening.  Just know that Kemp has assembled four men important to the black community. They're men whose disparate attitudes have the capacity to influence a wide population. Malcolm X is among them because the following morning Clay will announce he's becoming a Muslim and henceforth will be known at Muhammad Ali.  How that goes down with the others is the thrust of Powers's powerful 90-minute drama.  For instance, Brown, who's just made his first movie, won't convert, since that would mean giving up his grandmother's pork chops. While the men wrangle over their different positions, perhaps the crucial entanglement is between Malcolm X and Sam Cooke.  The former, who just then happens to be out of favor with the Nation of Islam, believes the latter could be doing more for his people than writing benign love songs, and in the heated discussion that follows Cooke singing ""You Send Me"" and ""A Change is Going to Come"" earns whopping audience approval. Before the 90-minute play ends, Powers has delivered a subtle lecture on racial intolerance that existed then and still does today--as, at a crucial moment, a projected image of Donald J. Trump attests.
******************
At first it might seem as if director Michael Longhurst has decided to deconstruct Peter Shaffer's Amadeus, at the National's Olivier, where it started in 1979.  To play the Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart music mentioned throughout the script, he dispatches 20 members of the Southbank Sinfonia all over the expansive stage. The idea is that whenever Antonio Salieri (Lucian Msamati) hears Mozart in his head as he reads the scores, the audience gets to hear it played right there in front of them.  Poor Salieri.  Even while he remains the acknowledged musical genius of the world ruled by Joseph II (Tom Edden), very imperious), he has to admit to himself that it's younger cut-up Mozart (Adam Gillen) who will live in perpetuity. Up to the point where Salieri hears his first Mozart serenade, Longhurst's approach seems big but not overblown. Salieri's response to what he experiences as exquisite physical pain does capture something rarely articulated about the effect of great music. But later Longhurst feels the need to build on Salieri's reactions to the scores as he peruses them, and that's where the production goes wildly wrong.  To end the first act Shaffer provides a scene in which Salieri, already considering himself the apex of mediocrity, scans several sheets of music and realizes that, though he's conscientiously devoted himself to his writing, he's woefully deficient when compared to the young whippersnapper, and his attempts to ruin Mozart's life ultimately disastrous.. The carrying-on that Longhurst has Msamati go through is unconscionable--such breast-beating and flailing and sobbing and collapsing.  Surely, this is not what Shaffer, who died this year at 90, had in mind.  These tortured shenanigans are hardly a tribute to him.  Nor is Gillan's outlandish performance, contorting himself as he constantly does, at one point hanging upside down from the piano frequently rolled on and off Chloe Lamford's striking, hulking steel-grey set. The result is that what initially looks to be a deconstruction is more a con and a destruction.  Where what the subtle Amadeus requires in direction is a Mozart counterpart, what it receives is a Salieri treatment.

If you're in town with young children, you might enjoy tripping to Wimbledon and the 40-year-old Polka Theatre where director-adapter Peter Glanville, composer Barb Jungr and puppet designer Samuel Wyer have turned Helen Stephens's How to Hide a Lion into a charming, slyly instructive 40-minute musical."
ARTS & CULTURE,"By Clint Randles, University of South Florida Some 150 years ago, if you wanted to listen to music, you would have to perform it yourself or be in the presence of musicians. With Thomas Edison's phonograph in 1877 came the ability to record music. At that point, the ways that people could be musical changed forever. Humans could artfully organize their musical worlds around recorded music that they did not necessarily create themselves. Since then people have engaged in an endless array of musical endeavors that have been recorded. In fact, the ability to record music has shifted our musical experience - from both a maker and a consumer perspective. The question is: has students' learning kept pace with these changes that started happening more than a century ago? Or, is it way past time for music education to undergo a metamorphosis of sorts, as some scholars have suggested? I teach music and conduct research in the area of music curriculum development. What is currently offered in music classes is almost exclusively large instrumental and vocal ensembles that perform under the direction of one person. However, there has been a fundamental shift in how people experience music in the world. I believe music classes today should teach students to create, record and share their music that comes from their personal interests.  The average American adolescent listens to music for approximately 4.5 hours per day. So, 18 percent of all of the time in their lives is spent bathing themselves in the sounds that inspire them. Much of the music that adolescents listen to is created digitally and produced through software, keyboards, touch pads, guitars and drums kits. However, music in the schools is based on conservatory models of musical transmission with roots in Western European art music.


Almost all school offerings are classical music-based.

 Furthermore, classical music accounts for merely 1.4 percent of music sales in the world. Yet, nearly all school music offerings are classical music-based. So, we have a supply-and-demand crisis in school-supported music teaching and learning. Music classes do not offer what most students want to learn. As a music teacher in the state of Michigan for nine years (before becoming a music professor), I saw many students who loved music, but just didn't love the school music options.  Only 10 percent of students at the  secondary level nationally end up enrolling in music classes.  What kind of music teacher would it take to make a 21st-century music classroom come to life? I would like to suggest here that perhaps the perfect example of the skill set required of a reenvisioned music teacher can be seen in the life of a music producer. These professionals are part musician, part technician, part guidance counselor and part magician for the artists that they work with. The following music producers could be inspiring examples for music teachers.



Sir George Martin could work with the Beatles at multiple levels.
CC BY-ND

 Sir George Martin, music producer of The Beatles, the most popular musical group of all time, assisted the group on a number of levels. Martin met the Beatles in 1962, a time when the music band was still in its early years. Martin was a product of both classical and vernacular training, having studied piano and oboe at the collegiate level. He was perfectly positioned to assist the aspiring young musicians, as he had learned the ropes of recording as an assistant in a studio recording primarily classical musicians.  He could orchestrate, position mics, discuss compositional strategies, and employ recording techniques to capture the best sounds the artists made. He sometimes played parts for them, like the harpsichord part of ""In My Life."" A second example is Phil Ramone, both an engineer and a music producer who worked with singers and musicians to develop their ideas and use the latest technology to share with the world. His professional demeanor and knowledge of how to get the most out of studio musicians helped Paul Simon record his song ""Kodachrome"" in the legendary Muscle Shoals recording studio, with the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section (MSRS). Knowing how to work with people is essential in the studio and studio as classroom. A third teacher role model is Phil Spector, known for his ""Wall of Sound"" production technique - using large, somewhat unconventional ensembles including multiple acoustic and electric guitars being doubled and tripled for emphasis. Spector was an expert at where to place a microphone to capture the best sound of an instrument, amplifier or voice. He had a command of the mixing console, latest sound-enhancement technology and methods to capture audio.  Music teachers could learn from the above examples on how to be a music producer, along with helping students in multiple other ways. Our world now has digital ways - via computers and the internet - to do most of the things that music producers have done in studios in the past. This has made what was once a very expensive unattainable task quite economically manageable.


What if students learned to record their own music?
CC BY-NC-ND

 Functioning as music producers, music teachers could guide students through challenges such as: How can multiple bands perform in the same room without bothering other bands via headphone hubs? How can students learn to mix tracks to their liking? How can students build an online artist profile to connect with the greater musical world? Recorded music along with live performance are the primary ways that people experience music, so I would like to suggest that more than half of the time spent in 21st-century school music education should be about students learning how to make their own music - with an emphasis on recording and sharing it. And music teachers should be equipped to help students realize their creative vision.

ARTS & CULTURE,"BEIJING, June 26 (Reuters) - Chinese Nobel Peace Prize winning rights activist Liu Xiaobo has been released from prison on medical parole and is being treated in hospital for late-stage liver cancer, his lawyer said on Monday in messages seen by Reuters. Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for “inciting subversion of state power” after he helped write a petition known as “Charter 08″ calling for sweeping political reforms in China. In December 2010, Liu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his activism promoting human rights in China, causing China to freeze diplomatic ties with Norway. China and Norway normalized ties in December last year. Shang Baojun, Liu’s lawyer, confirmed the news of Liu’s treatment in the city of Shenyang, and said the medical parole had been approved, in messages seen by Reuters. When asked about Liu, China’s foreign ministry, the only government body that will regularly answer questions from the foreign media, said it was not aware of the situation. The public security ministry and justice ministry did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment. Liu Xia, Liu’s wife who has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize, is suffering from depression but has been allowed to visit him in prison about once a month, a source close to the dissident told Reuters. Liu was not allowed to attend his father-in-law’s funeral last year and his mother-in-law’s funeral this year, said the source who asked not to be identified. Liu had been incarcerated at Jinzhou Penitentiary in Liaoning, his home province in northeast China, before being moved to the hospital for treatment. A man who answered the telephone at the Shenyang hospital where Liu is being treated said he could not check information on individual cases as there were too many patients in the hospital. Rights group Amnesty International also confirmed the news of Liu’s illness in a tweet. Amnesty International’s China Researcher, William Nee, said authorities should ensure Liu was receiving adequate medical care and he called for the immediate and unconditional release of Liu and his wife. “Obviously, it’s a shameful situation and it’s incredibly sad to see one of China’s most prominent intellectuals suffer from such a terrible illness when he never should’ve been detained in the first place,” Nee said. He also called for the Nobel Committee and the international community to speak up “forcefully” for Liu now. Tibetan writer and family friend Tsering Woeser said she had been in tears after reading reports of Liu’s illness online. “I’m shocked and deeply saddened,” she told Reuters. “All we can do now is pray for him.” In Oslo, the Norwegian Nobel Institute, which oversees the Nobel Peace Prize, declined to comment on reports of Liu’s hospitalization. “Our policy is that we do not comment on individual laureates,” an official said."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Donald Glover and Alden Ehrenreich dropped by “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” Monday to chat about all things pertaining to “Solo: A Star Wars Story.”  The new movie, which debuted at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, follows a young Han Solo (Ehrenreich) and his associates Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and Lando Calrissian (Glover). On a more personal note, it gave Glover what he describes as a “full circle” moment with his young son, Legend. The actor reveals that his very first toy was the original action figure version of Lando. Now, Legend is the proud owner of a Lando action figure in his father’s likeness.  “It’s super weird to me, because I gave it to my son,” Glover said. “His mom is always being like, ‘Who’s that?’ And he’s like, ‘Oh, this is Daddy.’ Daddy’s, like, riding a horse made out of Play-Doh.”  Witnessing his son play with an action figure of Dad, Glover said, was “weird, but beautiful.”  Ellen DeGeneres’ interview with Donald Glover and Alden Ehrenreich airs Monday. "
POLITICS,"A Koch brothers-backed nonprofit is targeting one of President Donald Trump’s favorite members of Congress as part of a new ad buy slamming House members who supported a $1.3 trillion spending package earlier this year. The six-figure effort from Americans for Prosperity is set to begin over Memorial Day weekend and includes direct mail, digital, radio and print ads aimed at 10 Republicans and seven Democrats. Among the GOP members is Pennsylvania’s Rep. Lou Barletta, the Republican nominee challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in November. Barletta became famous for leading a crackdown on illegal immigration while mayor of Hazleton more than a decade ago and was personally encouraged by Trump to run for the Senate.  “It’s time to take a hard look at what lawmakers say and what they actually do when it comes to reining in overspending,” said Americans for Prosperity spokesman Bill Riggs. “The $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill passed by Congress in March showed a complete disregard for fiscal responsibility. Both parties are responsible for putting the country on an unsustainable fiscal path, which is why AFP is committed to holding both parties accountable.” The expansive spending package narrowly passed the House and survived a brief veto threat from the president. The goal of the new campaign is to ensure that the next spending deal includes significant cuts to government spending.  The Koch brothers’ expansive political network spent heavily to help the GOP win and retain control of the Senate in 2014 and 2016, and it’s highly unusual for them to attack a GOP Senate candidate in a swing state, even if most handicappers consider Barletta an underdog in November.  Former Koch network operatives are also ubiquitous throughout the Trump administration and the group pushed aggressively for the GOP’s tax reform plan. But the network’s leaders have become more open about their frustrations that the president and his party aren’t following the network’s libertarian-influenced policy preferences on immigration, trade and government spending. Earlier this month, the group’s Hispanic outreach arm, LIBRE, sent out mailers thanking four Democratic lawmakers for their work to protect Dreamers.  “We will be looking for allies wherever we can find them ― on the left, the right, or in the middle,” James Davis, the executive director of the Koch-backed Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a CNN op-ed last month. “We welcome all comers. And we will hold those accountable who stand in the way of progress, regardless of their party.” This isn’t to say that the network, which has spent billions to advance conservative policies and elect Republicans over the past decade, is suddenly turning bipartisan. While they’re attacking Republicans like Barletta and vulnerable Michigan Rep. Mike Bishop, for example, they’re also slamming Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, who is challenging GOP Sen. Ted Cruz this fall, and hitting Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chair of the Democratic National Committee. And they’re also spending money on ads and direct mail thanking a large group of vulnerable Republicans who voted against the spending package, including Reps. Marsha Blackburn and Jim Renacci, the GOP nominees for Senate in Tennessee and Ohio; and Reps. Mike Coffman of Colorado and Rod Blum of Iowa, who are both top targets for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Other members targeted by the campaign are GOP Reps. Hal Rogers of Kentucky, Mike Simpson of Idaho, John Carter of Texas, Robert Aderholt of Alabama, Mark Amodei of Nevada, Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska, Tom Rooney of Florida and Ken Calvert of California, as well as Democratic Reps. Stephanie Murphy of Florida, Pete Visclosky of Indiana, Tom O’Halleran of Arizona, Henry Cuellar of Texas and Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania.  The ads are also thanking Republican Reps. Dave Brat and Tom Garrett of Virginia, Steve Pearce of New Mexico, Chris Stewart of Utah, Jason Lewis and Tom Emmer of Minnesota, Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin, Andy Harris of Maryland and Ted Budd of North Carolina."
ARTS & CULTURE,"“It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah” – Leonard Cohen I had never seen the actual painting, just poor, darkened reproductions. But I felt and understood the picture my grandfather painted in 1950 even before I laid eyes on it; it was painted as the family crisis escalated and my grandmother Mary’s impending breakdown loomed like an invisible wraith inside the home, something you could sense more than see. Shuffleton’s Barbershop is arguably Norman Rockwell’s masterpiece. It is chiaroscuro at its best – a noirscape of an after-hours moment in a small town barbershop. It appeared on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post in the spring of 1950. I felt apprehension, a well of emotion coming to the surface, as I sat in anticipation of seeing the painting in person for the first time. Would it live up to my expectations or disappoint me? I knew I was going to encounter my grandfather in a very different, more personal way this time. After researching their lives I now know what he and my grandmother were struggling through when he painted it; how they tried to shelter their three boys from the extent of my grandmother’s growing inner disturbances and the reliance on alcohol she hoped would soothe her inner wounds that were a mystery even to her. Her illness was their secret. Yet everyone knew. A bank of darkness had descended on what was supposed to be the perfect American family. The prevailing instinct is to protect that loved one who is emotionally and mentally ailing. And then to protect your children and yourself. Mary had dedicated herself to my grandfather and his work for over 15 years before she began to collapse. She had never individuated – she went from being an overly protected, isolated child to the wife of an already famous and successful American illustrator, 15 years her senior. And when the buried trauma and attending internal scavengers began to surface within her, she tried everything to find a solution – went to doctor after doctor, becoming attached to each one – until she snapped one day at a coffee counter in a service station in Arlington, Vermont in the dead of winter in early 1951. She broke down into uncontrollable tears as she sat with the younger family doctor who had been trying to analyze and help her. Perhaps in that moment she realized he couldn’t save her, he didn’t have the answers either, and once again, she was left with her overwhelming existential pain. She had improvised an infatuation for this doctor that was just an illusion. It is hard to separate Pop and Mary because in many ways they had always operated as a team. While some other couples slept in monastic side-by-side twin beds, my grandparents pushed their two mattresses together to make one bed. Each Saturday Evening Post cover was a labor of agony and love for both of them. Mary would often drive the models back and forth to the studio, cook lunch for them, scour the countryside for the specific props that Pop needed for each painting. My grandfather also used Mary as a model repeatedly. They had help – Pop always had an assistant in the studio and she had housekeepers in the home.  But when she began to seek out psychiatrists in the late ’40s, two of these male doctors unwittingly pulled her and her marriage apart in destructive ways. They questioned how she responded to her husband intimately without guiding her toward a real solution. They challenged her very concept of womanhood; one California doctor provided strange rules and edicts of wifely/female conduct. They began to open her up, yet failed to get to the root of her fragmentation, and then abandoned her. All of this swirled around me as I was led into a small side room at Sotheby’s in NYC – suddenly there was my grandfather’s painting on the wall, waiting for me. I felt shock that I had been granted such immediate access in this private viewing. This is the painting that had haunted me from afar. What struck me first was how much more light there is in the original than the reproductions – there is so much more to see. The influence of Rembrandt – his view of the “deep mysterious” – is unmistakably echoed in Rockwell’s ambitious use of glowing light and stark shadows. In the midst of the darkened room lit by secondary light, the radiant gold of the window sign letters and the bright orange of the fiery hearth call out contrast and almost beckon you inside. Hints and pops of color sneak in through the carefully displayed magazines and comics in front and the patriotic poster on the back wall. The observer is not just the black cat in the darkness with its right ear pulled back in uncertainty or annoyance; it is Norman Rockwell standing outside the cracked window – where his uncentered, diminished signature lingers – an isolated viewer, kept apart from the light of creativity and festive music in the illuminated back room. The older men play with calm joy, yet he remains an imprisoned outsider in the cold looking in. He is not completely alone, he knows his audience looks in with him from the same vantage point. He is quietly asking us for empathy – see, he silently nudges you, this is how I’m feeling, perhaps I’m not so alone after all. The symmetry of the two chairs with chipped paint like two guardians at the gate. The poorly painted window pane with layers of unscraped paint over the years, leaving paint marks on the window. The old broom leans against the wall as another character, its bristles peaking out from overuse. The startling clarity of the hot stovetop and the back light hitting the stovepipe where it enters the wall. A pair of shoes and a pair of beat up boots warm by the fire. The comforting softness of the worn ivory barber cloth draped over the arm of the chair; the channel of light from the other room exposes the intricate detail of the foot rest. Stray cigarettes from the day scattered on the floor. The revelation of the painting is the impressionist reflections in the back window – a play of gradations of gray. Pop always finds a way to surprise me. There is a tender dance between chaos and order, community and isolation. Pop had a number of reference photos of the cat taken. He enlisted his young son Peter and together they cajoled the cat into the correct pose; Pop sitting on his legs right by the cat, Peter on all fours, gesturing out in front. The first model, a round black and white tuxedo cat, wasn’t in the mood to cooperate. Pop replaced him with an all black cat with a leaner back who was more amenable. Did he really need the cat there? And why did he slightly cartoon its figure? Was it a form of slight sabotage to add that “Norman Rockwell” stamp of sentiment or did he feel he needed the ominous presence of a black cat looking on from the shadows – as he was feeling at that time? A grim harbinger of what was to come – perhaps Pop attempted to undercut the gloomy specter with a touch of humor.  When I stood back from all the details and silently took the painting in from the other side of the room a strange thing happened – the painting seemed to come to life dimensionally and allow me to enter into it. I was now the observer standing right outside the barbershop longing to be a part of the music in the back room – the barbershop opened up to me and I was transported inside – I knew that I could enter the lit back room if I wanted to. And that is the affirmation – it is the joy of art, of music, of community that saves us in those dark moments. It always saved Pop. Sotheby’s is planning to auction Shuffleton’s Barbershop and Shaftsbury Blacksmith Shop on November 13. Once again controversy circles around Norman Rockwell – people have always parasitically attached themselves to him, forged their identities by associating themselves with him and his work. He has attracted that sort of adulation and animus since his art entered into the public eye. People both revere and disparage his vision. Art is not created to stay in one place, it is created to move about and benefit the world. That is part of the magic of the artistic process – there is no true ownership. All of us are merely temporary custodians. These two paintings were painted in Vermont. Pop donated Shuffleton’s in 1958 and Blacksmith Shop in 1966 to the permanent collection of the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield, MA. The Berkshire Museum decided months ago to auction much of its art, including the two Rockwells, in an attempt to reimagine its future. What would Norman Rockwell want? He would want the two paintings to be placed where the most people would have easy access to them, to experience his work for themselves. His art is the art of the people. If this auction goes through, Mr. George Lucas, I am calling on you... to save the day, rescue the Rockwells and become the faithful custodian of them at your new museum. Hope persists, in spite of it all."
ARTS & CULTURE,"On Thursday morning, The Huffington Post received an email claiming to be from artist Dana Schutz, requesting that her painting “Open Casket” be removed from the 2017 Whitney Biennial because of the harm it inflicted upon black viewers. The email was soon revealed to be a hoax. Stephen Soba, Director of Communications at the Whitney Museum of American Art, told HuffPost that Schutz was in no way involved with the letter. For a brief period, however, it appeared to offer a long-awaited response to the outpouring of anger, pain and controversy surrounding the painting. Schutz’s painting, on view now at the Whitney, depicts the disfigured face of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old black teenager who was tortured and beaten to death in 1955 for allegedly whistling at a white women ― an allegation his accuser admitted to be false earlier this year. Emmett’s mother, Mamie Till Mobley, insisted Till’s casket be left open during his funeral, so that the racist brutality inflicted upon her son would not go unseen. Photos depicting Till’s battered body and face were published in the magazine “Jet,” becoming a catalyst in the fight for civil rights. The violence inflicted upon Till as a black American is not a thing of the past. “I made this painting in August of 2016 after a summer that felt like a state of emergency,” Schutz explained to Brian Boucher at Artnet News. “[T]here were constant mass shootings, racist rallies filled with hate speech, and an escalating number of camera-phone videos of innocent black men being shot by police. The photograph of Emmett Till felt analogous to the time: what was hidden was now revealed.” The goal of the Whitney Biennial ― the longest-running survey of American art ― has long been “to gauge the state of art in America today.” The 2017 exhibition, co-curated by Mia Locks and Christopher Y. Lew, was imagined amid the chaotic and anxiety-inducing backdrop of the 2016 presidential election. “This biennial arrives at a time rife with racial tensions, economic inequities and polarizing politics,” the curators write in the exhibition’s introductory statement, “inviting us to pause and pose questions in a tumultuous world.” The Biennial was described as “humanist” and “pro-diversity” by New York Times critic Roberta Smith, for its more-inclusive roster of artists compared to years past, as well as its consideration of themes including misogyny, immigration, racism, violence and religion. And yet the most audible conversation surrounding the show has revolved around the museum’s privileged exploitation of black suffering. It has also revolved around a white artist.  On March 17, the day of the Biennial’s opening, a group of protesters gathered around Schutz’s painting in protest, blocking it from view during the museum’s open hours. Artist Parker Bright stood in front of the painting for hours at a time, wearing a shirt that read “No lynch mob” on the front and “Black death spectacle” on the back. As he told The Guardian: “I wanted to confront people with a living, breathing black body.” Shortly thereafter, artist and writer Hannah Black circulated an open letter calling for the work to be removed from view and destroyed. “In brief,” she wrote, “the painting should not be acceptable to anyone who cares or pretends to care about Black people because it is not acceptable for a white person to transmute Black suffering into profit and fun, though the practice has been normalized for a long time.”  Black’s letter ― co-signed by 47 other artists, writers and curators of color ― was widely disseminated via social media and covered by publications including The New York Times and The Guardian. In response to Black’s letter (though without directly addressing its demands), curator Locks defended the decision to display “Open Casket” to The Guardian. “The horrific murder of Till is something we all have to confront, regardless of race,” she said.  On March 21, Rhizome assistant curator Aria Dean responded to Black’s letter (and Locks’ comments) on Facebook. To the idea that all Americans must “confront” Till’s image, she replied: I have already confronted it, and continue to confront it in its many forms ― those where the corpse is Till’s, those where another body takes his place. I already understand these images. We can argue about the power of painting, but I will confidently argue that no white person will look at this painting and feel anything close to what a black person feels when confronted with it. Likewise, I will argue that Dana Schutz’ time spent making it was time spent in the throes of a simulation of the sick, complicated eroticism of white violence against black bodies whether or not she admits it or has even given it thought. Dean, who co-signed Black’s letter, was also disturbed by the idea that, despite the artist and institution’s desire to address white supremacy through the artwork itself, both were less concerned about the pain and trauma of the many people of color speaking out against the work and pleading for its removal.  “We’re again confronted with this ongoing and tiresome problem,” Dean wrote, “where white and non-black people make symbolic gestures toward their supposed dedication to curbing antiblackness [sic] and overtly anti-black violence and refuse to do any work that has material impact on the lives of actual black people in this country.”  Poet Jenny Zhang, who participated in discussions related to the painting on Twitter, articulated her solidarity with Black’s message and echoed Dean in arguing that, whatever the original intention behind the painting, to ignore the suffering it ignited is unacceptable. “If you are a white artist and you create something that black people are telling you has caused harm, you ought to expend your energy, at the very least, on self-reflection, not self-defense,” Zhang wrote to HuffPost in an email. “It’s shameful to do anything less.” Additionally, Zhang, who is Chinese, wrote to the frequency with which black America is bombarded with images of violence and death at the hands of white supremacy. “I can’t even begin to imagine how it would feel if there was a graphic video of an Asian-American person being murdered in public showing up in my news feed every week, every month,” she added, “but that, as Hannah writes, is what black people in America are subjected to.” The Huffington Post’s Zeba Blay offered a similar message in an op-ed Wednesday, describing the painful repercussions of using black pain for white gain. “We see white artists and creators profit off of black trauma, black death, and black bodies time and time again,” she wrote. “We see it in the endless loop of shaky iPhone videos and dashcam clips that replay the deaths of black people like Alton Sterling, Philando Castille and Eric Garner over and over again on 24-hour cable news. We saw it in the photos of lynched black bodies shared as postcards all the way up to the 1960s.” Although such images are often circulated with the intention of spreading knowledge and compassion, they also yield a profit. As Blay put it: “Black trauma drives views and clicks. Black pain translates to dollars, even as we’re told that the spreading of images of black bodies equals awareness, empathy.” In a Facebook post written March 22, writer and curator Legacy Russell continued the conversation, arguing that the painting ― through abstracting and stylizing an image with such a specific political purpose ― is itself an act of erasure, as she put it, of “the equivalent of closing the coffin.” Furthermore, in directing the conversation toward Schutz and her work, Russell argues the entire ordeal erases the voices of Emmett Till, Mamie Till, and the many artists of color whose works in the Whitney are overshadowed.  “We need to be focusing less on Schutz here, and more on Mamie Till, and what her intentions were,” Russell wrote. “This was her baby boy, and seeing him ― and remembering what this violent America did to a 14-year-old boy ― is the thing that we all should be aiming for, not allowing that body to be made lyrical or poetic via the process of being formally abstracted, blurred, erased, forgotten.” A string of comments quickly erupted beneath Russell’s initial message. One dissenter, who, in an email to The Huffington Post, called the painting “a work of genius,” was Art F City editorial director Paddy Johnson. “I think it’s quite legitimate for artists like Hannah Black to be angered over the use of black pain as raw material, though I don’t personally agree with it,” she wrote. “Owning suffering is a very dangerous proposition, because it precludes the possibility not just of empathy but sympathy. Without that, there’s no way to bridge these gaps.” In the conversation that unfolded on Facebook, commenters questioned whether or not Johnson, who is white, has a stake in the Schutz controversy and should be positing her opinion at all. In a similar vein, Black, in her open letter, requested only people of color co-sign her message. The conflict raises questions about whether white individuals’ convictions are welcome or productive in conversations surrounding racial politics their experiences do not reflect.  Artist Kara Walker, a former professor of Schutz’s and the creator of 2014’s hit exhibition “A Subtlety,” offered a veiled yet passionate defense of Schutz’ work in an Instagram posted on Thursday. “Painting ― [sic] and a lot of art often lasts longer than the controversies that greet it,” she wrote. “I say this as a shout to every artist and artwork that gives rise to vocal outrage. Perhaps it too gives rise to deeper inquiries and better art. It can only do this when it is seen.” On March 27, The New York Times’ Roberta Smith penned a piece adding additional historical precedent to the current conflict, citing Walker’s early work as a somewhat similar circumstance. In 1997, she wrote, black artists began a letter-writing campaign against “what they considered the negative stereotypes of blacks” in Walker’s early works, described as “mercilessly Swiftian portrayals of antebellum plantation life.” Of course, Walker is black and Schutz is white, though both were criticized for eroticizing black suffering for aesthetic purposes.  The debate over Schutz’s painting even made its way to “The View.” On March 22, the show’s hosts argued that neither art nor empathy are specific to race, and the painting carries a painful yet important message regardless of who created it. They then discussed white artist Norman Rockwell and writer Mark Twain, whose depictions of black America helped to galvanize the forward progress for civil rights. Host Sara Haines added: “Now you have someone lifting up a story. Does it matter who lifted the story or that the story is being told?” The problem, for many, remains whether the story of Emmett Till needs to be visualized by a white artist to be salient and horrifying. To imply it does, as Dean put it, “stinks of a white savior mentality.” A piece published on March 27 on Hyperallergic by artist, writer and curator Coco Fusco, titled “Censorship, Not the Painting, Must Go: On Dana Schutz’s Image of Emmett Till,” renounced calls to remove and destroy the painting on the grounds that there is a “deeply puritanical and anti-intellectual strain in American culture that expresses itself by putting moral judgment before aesthetic understanding.” We may understand artworks to be indicators of racial, gender, and class privilege — I do, often. But presuming that calls for censorship and destruction constitute a legitimate response to perceived injustice leads us down a very dark path. Hannah Black and company are placing themselves on the wrong side of history, together with Phalangists who burned books, authoritarian regimes that censor culture and imprison artists, and religious fundamentalists who ban artworks in the name of their god. So what should be done? Black and her co-signers demand Schutz’s work be taken down and destroyed, as to never be publicly shown or sold in the future. Zubeida Agha, a pseudonymous member of the art activist group Guerrilla Girls, who goes by the name of a late Pakistani artist, suggested in an email to HuffPost that the Whitney replace Schutz’s work with Black’s open letter. Aletheia Wittman of The Incluseum, a project dedicated to increasing inclusion in museums, shared her thoughts with HuffPost as well. Specifically, Wittman highlighted the difference between freedom of expression ― the ability to create the artwork itself ― and giving it a platform at one of the most prestigious exhibitions in the U.S. Defenders of Schutz’s work have expressed, both on personal blogs and on Twitter, that threatening “Open Casket” is an act of censorship and a limitation of free expression, arguing that even if the subject matter is offensive or wounding, censorship is never the answer. But for Wittman, the central question is not whether the piece was made, but whether and where it was shown. “No one wants to censor art,” she said, “but as with opinions, when we are in the position of picking and choosing which to give space to, not all opinions should be aired and amplified. Space and power has been given to this work as a result of its inclusion in the Biennial and now we hope that trust can be rebuilt.” The fake letter that circulated Wednesday, purported to have been written by Schutz and directed to Locks and Lew, also called for the removal of the work in lieu of the pain it’s caused. Multiple outlets, including The Huffington Post, reported on the letter’s contents, treating the sentiments expressed within as Schutz’s. Hoax aside, the most recent, authenticated information we have regarding Schutz’s feelings about the controversy comes from her interview with Boucher. “The anger surrounding this painting is real and I understand that,” she said. ‘It’s a problematic painting and I knew that getting into it. I do think that it is better to try to engage something extremely uncomfortable, maybe impossible, and fail, than to not respond at all.” As of now, Schutz’s painting still hangs at the Whitney, and Black’s call for its destruction still stands. The artwork, along with the protests and conversations it ignited, certainly raised a variety of “polarizing” issues, as Locks called them, including but not limited to white privilege, the limits of freedom of expression, art world inequality, the exploitation of black bodies, the limits of empathy, and the very purpose of art.  With no closure in sight, perhaps one constructive, though hardly sufficient, course of action, is to take a step away from “Open Casket” and lift up some of the other 62 artworks included in The Biennial, specifically those that illustrate the black experience from the perspectives of artists of color, artists for whom the issue of racism in America is not a horrific revelation to be explored or a creative well to be mined, but a lived reality, day in, day out.  We have repeatedly reached out to the Whitney for an opportunity to speak with Schutz, but our requests have not yet been met.  Aria Dean and Legacy Russell granted permission to have their words, originally written on Facebook, featured in this piece. We have updated this piece to included excerpts from Roberta Smith and Coco Fusco.  Katherine Brooks contributed additional reporting to this piece."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Even the most dedicated “Game of Thrones” fan probably isn’t fluent in Dothraki or High Valyrian, the two fictional languages spoken in George R. R. Martin’s epic series. But that’s about to change. The University of California at Berkeley is offering a summer class in the Dothraki’s native tongue. And it’s led by Berkeley alum, linguist David J. Peterson, who created both languages for the critically acclaimed HBO show. Titled “The Linguistics of Game of Thrones and the Art of Language Invention,” Peterson’s class will meet for four days a week during the May 22 - June 30 summer term, according to Berkeley News.  The show’s seventh season is scheduled to return on July 16. And actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays Jaime Lannister on the show, confirmed this week that many of the leaks about the show’s upcoming season are real.  “Every year, there are huge spoilers online where people find out real stuff and they will post it, and you go, ‘Oh my God, they just spoiled the whole season online!’ But then, because there’s 10,000 other spoilers out there, they’re not real. It just gets lost in the shuffle,” he told HuffPost. “So, it’s all out there by the way ... if you can find it.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,"
 Illustration by Priscilla Frank   It's a crucial moment in the primary campaign, and a New Hampshire reporter has just published a brutal article describing a recording he found of Selina Meyer and her campaign staff mocking her donors. Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) rounds on her staff, eyes wild, poised to attack. ""You know what V.P. stands for? It stands for 'victory permafucked.' I don't deserve it. You know? Goddammit. I don't, but you do, because you are all losers!"" she hisses. She points at her loyal, masochistic aide, Gary. ""Loser!"" She jabs a finger at her campaign manager, Amy. ""Loser!!""  Meyer, the protagonist of HBO's biting political comedy ""Veep,"" now in its fourth season, isn't warm and cuddly, or cute and charming. She's foul-mouthed, selfish, nakedly ambitious, opportunistic, and sometimes cruel. She's no Lucille Ball -- she's not even Elaine Benes. Comediennes today are plunging into far more transgressive roles than the female sitcom leads of previous eras, and as Louis-Dreyfus' Meyer exemplifies, it's working.  Audiences have flocked to female-led sitcoms like ""30 Rock,"" ""New Girl,"" ""Parks and Recreation"" and ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"" leading to an apparent boom in complex, flawed comedy heroines on TV -- but also an unsettling degree of pushback from fans and critics.  The bountiful variety of women leading sitcoms today seems like cause for unmitigated celebration, but not everyone is convinced.  Taboo-busting female characters in comedy make many critics feel unsettled, and it’s not just the traditionalists. A surprising level of finger-wagging has been coming from feminist and pro-woman sources, the very viewers who might be expected to back this blossoming of complex female leads.  ""Mazel Tov, Dummies!"": Women in Sitcoms Are Ascendant Hoping to get a firmer grip on the current foregrounding of women in the sitcom realm, and why it’s sparking backlash, I sat down with my coworkers to examine major female leads in sitcoms past and present, and the evolution quickly became apparent. We broke the characters down first by whether they exemplified 20 commonly depicted personality traits (a process that involved extensive debate, and admittedly a bit of subjectivity), and noticed that in the past decade, they’ve come to be defined by a more diverse set of personality traits. They're actually becoming, well, three-dimensional.   Breaking these characteristics into four categories -- traits generally perceived as stereotypically masculine, positive and negative, and stereotypically feminine, positive and negative -- we also noticed that earlier female characters typically presented traits from only two of those categories.  Initially, characters such as Lucy Ricardo might have been positive feminine (kind and quirky) but also negative feminine (shallow and incompetent). Women in sitcoms weren't just characters, they were caricatures of their gender.  After a while, there seemed to be a reaction to this one-note depiction -- there followed a wave of funny women given qualities usually bestowed upon male characters. ""For a long time, there was pressure to seem like... you were cool,"" says comedy journalist Elise Czajkowski. ""You were one of the guys."" For example, Roseanne played a schlubby, gruff working woman just trying to take care of her clan -- a classic man's leading archetype.   Elaine Benes, part of a male-dominated ensemble on ""Seinfeld,"" embodied one of the guys, but also vamped her way into a string of relationships, which she generally torpedoed through her neurotic or self-involved behavior. Elaine spanned the spectrum.  Selina Meyer doesn't have traditional feminine virtues, but she has flaws associated with men and with women, as well as attributes prized in men. Plus, Selina is a fantastic character, a mass of insecurity and narcissism and charm and nastiness, brilliantly portrayed by Louis-Dreyfus. Her performance on the show has met with seemingly universal plaudits. Not every female sitcom character can be Selina, however. Actually, if the TV landscape were populated with gaffe-prone, cutthroat careerists like the veep, she probably wouldn't seem quite so hilarious.  ""Kaboom"": What Makes Things Funny? ""The evolution of comedy is toward being more and more specific,"" says Czajkowsi. ""75 years ago... everybody just did each other’s jokes."" With shows ranging from the dark, gross-out comedy of ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"" to the aggressively sunny ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"" sitcoms today are diversifying, refusing to settle into a single, sad rut.  It's still a matter of debate whether clichés and stereotypes make for successful comedy. Though some viewers enjoy the comfort of familiar, trite jokes, the root of humor lies in a moment of surprise, argues cognitive neuroscientist Scott Weems, the author of Ha!: The Science of When We Laugh and Why. Weems studies the cognition behind laughter, and has come to believe that humor is ""what the brain does when it's confronted with something that doesn't immediately make sense.""   In a recent episode of ""Broad City,"" for example, Ilana's mother tells the girls that the nail salon where they're about to get mani-pedis has been really cheap since someone got a staph infection there. ""Staph is not the real bad one, right?"" says Abbi hopefully. ""Yeah,"" replies Ilana's mom in a reassuring, maternal tone. ""It is."" Not only is this a shocking answer, but it's delivered in a downbeat moment, not with the broad wink that cues us to expect a joke.  Peter McGraw, co-author of The Humor Code: A Global Search for What Makes Things Funny, has a slightly different take: Laughter comes from a moment of violation that we recognize as ultimately benign. This theory also explains the above example -- at least given that the girls don't get staph infections. The benign violation theory also, McGraw argues, accounts for the range of possibility in the humor arena. ""The world of violations, the world of things that can go wrong is quite vast,"" he points out, and at the same time, ""There are many ways that you can make things okay."" ""Retreat To Move Forward"": How Feminist Nitpicking Targets Women Comedians Given the free-wheeling structure of comedy, a laser focus on social equality can be as limiting to female comics as dated stereotypes. A medium that capitalizes on shock and broken taboos can't thrive when performers are expected to hew to a narrow script. Yet many in the audience do expect female characters to maintain certain standards. Characters from Liz Lemon to Mindy Lahiri have been critiqued not for failing as comic figures, but for presenting a negative image of their sex -- for proving to be too weak, selfish or obsessed with men to embody the ideal modern woman.  It's natural that empowered, modern women feel it's time to leave husband-hunting ladies and ditzy chicks in the past. ""It's 2015,"" we think, outraged. ""Don't scriptwriters know women can be CEOs and stay single by choice until they die, happily alone?"" Perhaps that's why Selina Meyer has mostly escaped gendered criticism -- she may not be good at her job, but she's still the freaking vice president, and while she's cruel and abrasive, those qualities aren't exactly feminine stereotypes. Selina feels like sociopolitical progress.  What doesn't feel like sociopolitical progress: The gendered critique directed at female stars and showrunners whose characters don't strike us as inspirational.  Mindy Lahiri, of ""The Mindy Project,"" was deemed too ""crazy,"" especially boy-crazy, for the big time. ""This is a show about a single woman trying to get -- nay, keep -- a boyfriend,"" wrote Flavorwire's Jillian Mapes. ""I thought Mindy was better than that."" And Jessica Day, the titular ""New Girl,"" is too quirky for Seyward Darby, who wrote for The New Republic that Jess's trademark eccentricity is a ""painfully shallow presentation."" Liz Lemon quickly became a beloved icon of grouchy career women, but toward the end of ""30 Rock""'s run, critics became less forgiving of her personal flaws. ""Liz has been fully transformed into a needy little girl,"" wrote Linda Holmes at NPR during Season 6. ""Now, she's just dumb, incapable of making her own decisions."" The ""New Girl"" team directly addressed the relentless critique of Jess Day as too adorkably feminine in the Season 1 episode ""Jess and Julia.” ""I brake for birds. I rock a lot of polka dots,"" Jess snaps at a disdainful, hard-edged lawyer. ""I'm sorry I don't talk like Murphy Brown ... that doesn't mean I'm not smart and tough and strong."" Meanwhile, Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker, as she so often has, stepped up to bat for the beleaguered Liz, arguing, ""From the beginning Liz Lemon was pathetic. That was what was enthralling, and even revolutionary, about the character [...] The show let her be the George Costanza, not the Mary Richards.""   Not every female character, in short, should have to be standard-bearers for her sex's worthiness. Male characters have never been saddled with that -- just ask George Costanza. ""Everything Sunny All the Time Always"": The Burden of the Admirable Woman Comic Even the lovable stoners of ""Broad City"" have run afoul of expectations. They may not be prissy enough to draw the ire of feminist critics, but their post-grad malaise doesn't ideally represent the female sex either. Ilana wears crop-tops to an office job, where she specializes in taking naps sitting up. Abbi just hopes to make it to trainer at the cultish gym where she picks up sweaty towels. The girls explore masturbation, pegging, and drug use. Murphy Brown, though considered controversial in her own time, wouldn't recognize them. When Jimmy Kimmel hosted Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer on January 19, he took a paternal tack: ""I would be worried... if you were my daughters, I'd be like, uh, is this real life or did you cook this up, I hope, in the comedy room?"" Kimmel's concern-troll-cum-question hints at his discomfort with women, rather than men, writing and performing comedy about sex, drugs, and misbehavior. When has a late-night host seriously suggested he would be concerned by the comedic antics of a male star, ""if you were my son""?  One of the age-old obstacles for women comedians has been this darker side of the benign violation theory of humor: The source of the violation can matter as much to our perception of its benignity as the success of the joke itself. When women break certain taboos, it's not a benign violation anymore. It's just a violation.  But humor by its nature asks performers to break social codes of conduct; successful sitcom protagonists tend to be inconsiderate, intrusive, clumsy, rude or downright dumb. Think Michael Scott, Frasier Crane, Jerry Seinfeld.  By closing certain avenues of comedy to women, critics may feel they're shielding the so-called gentler sex. More often than not, however, they're helping to corral female comics into heavily circumscribed roles, then wondering why people don't think women are funny. They are, of course, but they're also more funny the more diverse and adventurous the roles they take on.  In a recent, aptly named piece on xoJane, ""UNPOPULAR OPINION: Hey Broad City, A Woman Doesn't Have To Be A Hot Mess To Be Funny,"" Emily Gaudette took on Abbi and Ilana directly. Gaudette admits to disappointment that the on-screen BFFs aren't a bit more together. ""'Broad City' chooses to exaggerate the misconception that women my age are, essentially, a mess,"" she complains. As Gaudette's article demonstrates, Abbi and Ilana may seem, to some viewers, to be reinforcing a frustrating stereotype about slacker millennial women. She regretfully compares ""Broad City"" to a host of other shows, asking why Abbi and Ilana lack the bouncy resourcefulness of Mindy Lahiri in ""The Mindy Project,"" or the professional drive of Selina Meyer in ""Veep,"" or the big heart and proficiency of Leslie Knope in ""Parks and Recreation."" Why can't they be admirable in addition to being funny? “Women in Garbage”: Why Women Comedians Aren't Keeping Their Hands Clean
 The strength of ""Broad City"" lies in its refusal to kowtow to this expectation, or to the expectation that they keep their clothes on and behave. They betray no anxiety about their decidedly un-model behavior in the show; they appear to feel no pressure to represent women in an admirable light.   Even more importantly, ""Broad City"" doesn't attempt to follow a template laid out by previous ladies of the sitcom world. The show isn't ""The Mindy Project"" or ""Veep."" It's specific. It's risk-taking. It can't be mistaken for any other show on TV. To demand more homogeneity, to ask that Ilana Wexler be more like Mindy Lahiri and that Mindy be more like Leslie Knope, disregards the nature of comedy. Liz Meriwether, the creator and showrunner of ""New Girl,"" has played this game long enough to know she's expected to write a female role model, and to know her response to that expectation: ""It doesn't lead you into good work."" Instead, Meriwether told me, she strives for honesty and humor. Despite public debates about female characters' relatability, she says, ""I think women respond to honesty. I think women respond to all the things that men respond to in characters, and I don’t think men only like to see men portrayed in a positive light."" If you want to watch a sitcom featuring a female lead today, you have an abundance of solid options -- and that's not even accounting for the dramedic ""Girls"" and ""Jane the Virgin,"" or the transcendent, lacerating sketch comedy of ""Inside Amy Schumer."" Determined women who brushed aside the traditional restrictions on their comedy have won at least a few major skirmishes, and they've staked out a newly broad territory for women in sitcoms.  What's more, a variety of funny ladies on TV helps make future comic expression for women even more free-ranging. Female-focused humor might feel foreign to audiences accustomed to bro comedy, and until they get used to it, the jokes can be lost in translation. ""Menzies"": Why We Don't Laugh About Lady Stuff Comedy draws from a set of shared experiences, and as long as men in the crowd know little about women outside of the manicured, sanitized version so often presented to them, they have little basis for grasping their humor. ""For you and I to be laughing at the same thing,"" McGraw says, ""it really helps if we see the world in the same way."" If half the audience knows next to nothing about periods, birth control, or having boobs, jokes about the nuances of such experiences will fall flat -- and when the comedy powers-that-be mostly have penises, that gap in understanding can be particularly damaging.  ""Ugh, women comics, they just talk about their period,"" says Czajkowski, voicing an omnipresent trope that haunts female performers. ""I never hear anybody do that, because it’s come to be seen as taboo."" The woman comedian who does routines about being on the rag is a despised figure in the comedy scene. But as Chelsea Peretti joked in her special ""One of the Greats,"" ""If guys got their period, there's no way a male comedian would be up here, bleeding out of his dick, just like 'I'm not gonna talk about it. It would be declassé.' [...] If guys got their period, 90 percent of standup comedy would just be people running around being like 'I was bleeding out of my diiiiickkkk!'""  Meriwether, who created a whole episode about menstruation and men's discomfort with it during Season 2 of ""New Girl,"" points to another possible consequence of this marginalization of female experiences. ""Sometimes it's men who are nervous,"" she says of the pressure to sanitize female characters in comedies. ""Because they don’t understand a woman’s experience, the default is to try to make the character really 'likable.'""  This blind spot isn't irreparable. Much as women have long consumed entertainment featuring male voices and learned to relate to them, men now have a bounty of female-driven comedy -- and other media -- giving them a crash course on how the other half lives. The more women play non-stereotypical, complex comic characters on TV, the more the general audience will relate to and enjoy their comedy.   This suggests there may be an uncomfortable acceptance curve for underrepresented groups in comedy. For example, the benign violation theory makes room for hackneyed jokes exploiting stereotypes, says McGraw. ""Because comedy arises from things that aren't quite right, it's often the negative stereotypes that play in comedy,"" he points out. ""Stereotypes are really useful in the sense that they reflect a shared if perhaps flawed understanding of groups.""  Still, the most successful humor may buck those stereotypes, he suggests: ""What’s considered 'good' comedy, not with regard to the 'haha,' but with regard to the 'aha,'... is the stuff that’s not obvious."" Audiences may laugh at a joke poking fun at Asians' driving skills, but a joke skewering the widespread stereotype about Asian people being poor drivers would be fresher and more effective, he says.  It may even make us reexamine our impolitic assumptions. ""Primarily, comedy reflects changes in people's belief...  In that way we talk about comedy as a thermometer,"" McGraw says. ""But it can work as a thermostat, I believe. If you get people laughing by pointing out the inconsistencies in what people say ... these kinds of social pressures really do work."" He cautions that little evidence exists to demonstrate the efficacy of satirical humor in changing minds, but, as Czajkowski points out, ""If you're laughing at something then you don't find it scary."" That's a powerful shift. ""What to Expect When You're Expanding"": The Rocky Road to Comic Representation on TV Minority groups, including Asian-Americans, face a similar, if perhaps more daunting, tightrope act as women do: Lean into the stereotype, or push against it? Remaining safely in the middle, even pretending the stereotype doesn’t exist, may seem safest, but as long as the stereotypes persist, ignoring them tends to feel bland.  Mindy Kaling, the star and creator of “The Mindy Project,"" walks a particularly landmine-strewn path; her identity as both a woman and an Indian-American intrudes constantly upon evaluations of her comedy. In the show, her Indian heritage doesn’t take center stage. Surrounded by white coworkers and boyfriends played by Caucasian dreamboats like Chris Messina and Glenn Howerton, Dr. Mindy Lahiri's racial identity is rarely treated as more than an opportunity to throw in glib one-liners (""I'm Indian, I can't be racist!"").   Yet the show has been a target for both feminist and race-conscious tsk-tsking. On the one hand, Lahiri's been labeled too vain and melodramatic, a feminine caricature. On the other, Kaling's been slammed for a lack of diversity in the show’s casting. ""I'm a fucking Indian woman who has her own fucking network television show, OK?"" Kaling responded at SXSW last year. ""No one asks any of the shows I adore ... why no leads on their shows are women or of color.""  The loveable but problematic “Fresh Off the Boat” distills this liminal position held by Asian-American comics. The first network sitcom to feature an Asian-American family since the 1995 cancellation of Margaret Cho’s “All-American Girl,” it constantly balances cheap stereotypes with insightful humor, with mixed success. It’s now 2015, and we're still laughing at jokes about an Asian mom complaining that school is too easy when her son brings home straight As. It's no coincidence that, as Fusion recently uncovered, Asians make up a disproportionately low percentage of main TV cast members.  Kaling's comedy, which mingles middle-school slumber party perkiness with the acerbic exasperation of that middle-schooler's mother, brings something different and complex to TV (not to mention a starring role in a network show for an Indian comedian and actress, no small feat). Her character may be shallow, selfish, and confrontational, but she's also endearing, idealistic, and a great doctor. Those things may sound contradictory, but real people are complicated like that. Her race, like her gender, also makes things complicated. Her race, like her gender, makes her audience respond to her with a heightened scrutiny, a ready sense of disappointment. This week, FOX canceled ""The Mindy Project"" after just three seasons; the show had been struggling in the ratings against NBC's stereotype-fueled snorefest ""One Big Happy."" Though fans remain hopeful for a second chance (a multi-season deal with Hulu has been rumored), the cancellation is another disappointing setback. ""Bro Club for Dudes"": Getting Chicks in the Comedy Club For women, or at least white women, the evolution past screwball punchline has been in the works for decades, and the proliferation of unlikable, uninspiring, and even unrelatable heroines suggests we've reached a tipping point. It's no longer glass-ceiling-exploding news when a Tina Fey or Amy Poehler gets her own show; it's expected. Once comediennes played into or against stereotypes. Now, the most recognizable female characters in sitcoms combine traits from across the spectrum. They're magnetic role models mixed with black sheep, with a soupçon of terrible judgment.   Maybe Jess, Mindy, or Abbi and Ilana enact certain characteristics viewers don't care to see women associated with or find retrogressive. But they're real. ""I'm a woman, Zooey's a woman, we're both talking about our experiences,"" says Meriwether. ""Why are our experiences not deemed worth talking about?""  Pretending those aspects of our humanity don't exist only holds back comediennes from gaining parity in their field; they'll never reach their full potential if it remains taboo for one sex to make humor out of shameful or absurd behavior.  Women can't be funny if audiences can't stand to see them be the butt of the joke sometimes. Paragons are rarely hilarious.  If the entertainment world has finally evolved past stereotype-driven female comedy, the inclusion of impolitic characters -- a lazy millennial girl, a desperate single woman -- will be part of the deal. To get girls fully accepted into the boys' club of comedy at last, it might just be worth it."
ARTS & CULTURE,"The old theater saying that goes ""If you have a great finish, you don't have to worry about anything else"" comes close to working for the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Glenn Slater-Julian Fellowes musical adaptation of School of Rock, screenwriter Mike White's 2003 movie starring Jack Black. And like just about every other of the not abundant high points in this Lloyd Webber-ized School of Rock,, it involves the terrific young actors -- several of them young actor-musicians -- working like cheerful demons in the story about offensive wannabe rock star Dewey Finn (Alex Brightman, apparently no relation to Sarah), who deviously takes a temporary teaching job at exclusive Horace Green. (Think Horace Mann.)  The high-paying position had been offered to best pal Ned Schneebly (Spencer Moses) with whom Dewey had been squatting rent-free, a freeload not much to the liking of working housewife Patti Schneebly (Mamie Parris). The raise-the-Winter-Garden-roof conclusion takes place -- as these sorts of competition-plotted properties do (see, for instance Glee and Pitch Perfect) -- at a battle. Here it's The Battle of the Bands, where the polite, school-uniformed young-uns whom Dewey has turned into rockers are vying against Metallica copycats. To the delight of the previously skeptical parents paying $50,000 annually to educate their progeny, Dewey's kids deliver a rousing version of ""In the End of Time,"" supposedly written by pint-sized guitarist Zach (Brandon Niederauer).  And make special note that the rest of Dewey's wow-inducing competitive band includes keyboardist Lawrence (Jared Parker), bassist Katie (Evie Dolan), drummer Freddie (Dante Melucci) and lead singer Tomika (Bobbie MacKenzie). MacKenzie as the shy and for quite a while silent Tomika provides for another of the production's crowd-pleasing moments, although how and why won't be revealed here.  The other peak, which is actually the first and arrives after School of Rock's initial numbing 20 minutes or so, has Dewey transforming his docile charges into enthusiastic heavy-metal would-bes by means of a clanging ditty called ""You're in the Band."" Oh, yes, musical comedy aficionados, it's the non-voting-age players, including the adorably proficient Isabella Russo as the band manager, who steal this undertaking while the bigger names above and below the title hit wonky notes on their figurative Fender guitars.  (Notice that the above-the-title producers include at the pinnacle Lloyd Webber, of course, and then both The Shubert Organization and The Nederlander Organization.  Consult Michael Riedel's Razzle Dazzle for background on this not common occurrence.) Since this wide-eyed commentator hasn't seen the instigating hit movie, he can only imagine that something crucial was lost in the transition from screen to stage.  Even the set-up where a substitute teacher refers to his well-behaved students as ""douchebags"" and blathers about being ""pissed"" without anyone calling him out hits this viewer as unusually far-fetched.  But breathe easy: no four-, seven- or 12-letter words infect Fellowes's dialog or Slater's lyrics. When Dewey posing as Ned shows up late on his first day, he encounters school head Rosalie Mullins (Lloyd Webber favorite Sierra Boggess), who's painted as something of a martinet.  She isn't, however, so extremely martinet-ish that it crosses her mind to drop in on temp teacher Schneebly's class in his first few days to see how he's faring.  Nor does she or any of the other faculty members, all of whom are presented as dullards, appear to take exception to the high-decibel blasts from Dewey's classroom, where all other subjects have been jettisoned. But, okay, your reporter pleads guilty to being a stickler where suspension of disbelief may be called for.  Sure, there's nothing way wrong, to slip into the vernacular, with the script device that has Rosalie turn out to be a closet fan of Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks and warble bits of the beloved Nicks-Mike Campbell ""Freedom.""  It's more than a bit of a contrivance, but let that go. What about other rankling School of Rock aspects?  What about the Lloyd Webber-Slater score, when, that is, Slater's words are intelligible?  You could ask, ""When are rock lyrics ever intelligible?  They're not meant to be intelligible.""   Needless to say, that's a cop-out--certainly in a musical. Over the five decades of Lloyd Webber's phenomenal career, he's so often been accused of cribbing from Giacomo Puccini that no one cares to hear about it any more.  He won't get that this time around.  Now, he's more likely to be called out for trying to prove he's as contemporary as can be, though his newest melodies and riffs, which he orchestrated, conjure only Broadway-rock of the '70s.  If just about all the numbers swiftly begin to sound alike, that's because they are--as is JoAnn M. Hunter's choreography. A big surprise -- possibly the biggest surprise -- isn't the more than adequate Anna Louizos sets and costumes, the Natasha Katz lighting or the Mick Potter sound.  It's the Fellowes book.  For those who aren't aware, he's the bloke responsible for the fathomlessly witty Downton Abbey.  Yet, here he has the young lad tapped to be the band costumer declare that his favorite singer is Barbra Streisand.  At one point, he has Dewey inform the kids that rock icons aren't necessarily well educated and mentions Mick Jagger, who did attend the London School of Economics.  He had Dewey off-handedly call an Asian student ""Lucy Liu."" Perhaps Fellowes can't be blamed for having loose-mouthed Dewey resort to the over-used adjective ""awesome"" three times (or was it four?), which brings up Brightman's performance.  There's no question that he attacks the role like a furious pit bull, but Dewey is such an unpleasant guy, as well as spineless, that all the expended energy in the first two-thirds of the two-act tuner does little to mitigate the charmless freeloader he is. Incidentally, everything the incensed Patti Schneebly says about Dewey is true, and earned.  Still, Fellowes eventually turns her into a villain of the piece.  The ploy is just another indication of the twists needed to keep the audience on Dewey's side.  Only late in the proceedings -- when he's gotten round Stevie Nicks-lover Rosalie and has realized how much he owes the children -- does Dewey prove a winning presence.  At last, Brightman's high-voltage activity pays off. Laurence Connor, who revivified the current Les Miserables revival so adroitly, directs School of Rock.  He's obviously a whiz with the youngsters and gets sufficient life from the supporting cast, Boggess chief among them -- not that anyone would champion many of the one-dimensional characterizations. As for Lloyd Webber: The Phantom of the Opera undoubtedly stands as his crowning achievement to date, but few will underrate Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Evita, Jesus Christ Superstar or Cats.  He's put a lock on his reputation.  But few this side of the Atlantic reaiize that his The Beautiful Game, Love Never Dies and the truly dreadful Stephen Ward -- not one of these crash-and-burns mentioned in his lengthy program bio--have never been exported, and for good reason. It may even be that he premiered School of Rock here so that he could say he finally got a new show on in Manhattan.  Nonetheless, were it not for Russo, MacKenzie, Niederauer, Dolan, Parker, Melucci and their knee-high-to-grasshopper compatriots, musical lovers wanting to watch Broadway school teachers interact with pupils might be better off right now at either Matilda or The King and I. But Russo, MacKenzie, Niederauer, Dolan, Parker, Melucci and thesbian classmates are present and accounted for.  More power to them."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Lloyd and Harry are finally back together again! Kinda. Jim Carrey crashed “Dumb and Dumber” costar Jeff Daniels’ interview with Conan O’Brien on Tuesday night, and it made for some entertaining viewing. Daniels was ostensibly on the show to promote his new Hulu miniseries, “The Looming Tower.” But he appeared visibly stunned when Carrey sauntered onto the stage. The duo warmly embraced before performing a dance.  “Jeff had no idea you were coming out,” said O’Brien. See how the impromptu encounter played out in the clip above."
ARTS & CULTURE," ""I am not afraid of dying. I am afraid of no longer living."" ""No Comment"" is the title for the opening of the exhibition of Chinese artist, Yan Pei Ming, at the Center for Contemporary Art in Málaga (CAC, Centro de Arte Contemporáneo). Yan Pei Ming (b. 1960, Shanghai) grew up during the Maoist Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and worked as an artist to support the regime. Later on, he was part of the first group of artists to flee China in 1980. With great expectations, he arrived in France to study Fine Arts and earned a degree in that subject in Dijon, Paris and Rome. This geographical, cultural and artistic shift has had a substantial impact on his work. The work of Yan Pei Ming stands out because of its decisively simple palette of red, white and black, and its forceful yet precise brushstroke line that sends us into his private world. His work primarily focuses on the portrait, an artistic genre that he depicts by emphasizing the psychological burden displayed by his iconic subjects. When you enter into the Parisian studio of this French-Chinese artist, you get the immediate sensation that you've not only traveled through the history of Western painting, but also that you've seen traces of the time period when he was working to support the Mao regime.  All in all, Yan Pei Ming is, perhaps, one of the best examples of what it means today to be an artist in a global world -- where human beings, in a particularly dramatic way, are confronting experiences of solitude and death.  Elena Cué: You grew up in China in the midst of the Cultural Revolution and then relocated to France when you were 20 years old. You studied for five years at the National Superior School of Fine Arts in Dijon.  What was the pictorial evolutionary process like going from the limitation of propagandist art to support the regime to complete freedom? Yan Pei Ming: At that time in China, the influence on painting was from the classical tradition originating from the Soviet Union.  It was propagandist painting to support the regime at that time. Those five years that I spent at the National Superior School of Fine Arts in Dijon were years of absolute freedom for me. From that moment on, I was able to combine what I learned from propagandist painting with a very individualized view of today's world. My freedom of expression is very noticeable in my current work.  E.C: How did you survive the East to West cultural shock, going from a communist regime to Mitterrand's Socialist France? Y.P.M: In France, individuality was what stood out. In my opinion, the politics of François Mitterrand were, no doubt, socialist, but still liberal.  E.C: You graduated from the French Academy (Villa Medici) in Rome in 1993.  What was your impression of Italy? What was that experience like?

Y.P.M: It was one-of-a-kind. I had an incredible year.  It was as if I was in paradise, following the steps of all of the great painters that had come through this city. Those old masters help me to understand art from the past and they pave the way for me to make art that must be done nowadays. It was an unforgettable experience for me.   E.C: What memories do you have from childhood? Y.P.M: My childhood was blessed, but lonely. Even from my earliest years, I was in my own universe.  I always dreamed of being a painter because I could express myself without words.  That's powerful.  E.C: You have painted your father several times, even dead. Tell me about him, please. Y.P.M: I have always done portraits of my father, just as much in China as in France.  I have captured him at different times in his life, and at different ages.  My way of seeing him has evolved over the years.  Also, there are oftentimes characteristics and defects that I've been able to find in the titles of those portraits. It's true that the way in which a child sees his father is not the same way an adult sees an older parent.  I think that my portraits of him bring that to light.   E.C: You have depicted Mao on several occasions.  What does that mean and who is Mao, in your opinion? Y.P.M: He has been present in my work since I was a boy. His was the most copied and most widespread image in China. That left a mark on me.  I also remember that my first lesson at school was entitled, Long Live President Mao! He is a mythical character.  E.C: Your 2009 exhibition, ""The Funerals of Mona Lisa,"" made you the first Chinese artist to exhibit at the Louvre Museum. A huge portrait of Mona Lisa was accompanied by four paintings: two self-portraits depicting skulls from the cranium scanner, a portrait of your dead father and a self-portrait in which you pretend to be dying, which tops off the exhibition.  Why is Mona Lisa crying? Can you explain this peculiar scene? Y.P.M: It is a piece that I did in 2009 for the Louvre. It is a polyptych called, ""The Funerals of Mona Lisa."" I reinterpreted Leonardo da Vinci's portrait to be Mona Lisa crying at her own funeral and in front of spectators. My expression is similar to that of Marcel Duchamp after adding a few whiskers.   E.C: Your existential concern began at a very young age. The ongoing presence of death in your thinking is constantly represented in your work.  Does the idea of death make you reaffirm life? Y.P.M: A lot of emotional states appear in my work:  my anxiety, my pain, my uncertainty. It is important for death to be present as well -- and, of course, energy and life. I don't need to sugarcoat or make things fancy. Paintings aren't for cuddling.   E.C: What worries you most about death? Y.P.M: When I think about death, I rise up. From that point on, I work even harder to fill up on life. I'm not afraid of death.  I'm afraid of no longer living.  E.C: Iconic paintings of art history and celebrities, your self-portraits and the representation of your father. Do you think that it is a way to transcend?

Y.P.M: I'm interested in everything, just as much art history as historical figures and the anonymous. The construction of history and sociopolitical issues interest me a lot. They all form our world as well as my painting.   E.C: Much of your work involves portraits, primarily figures, politicians or celebrities with sometimes serious and solemn expressions, yet kind and friendly other times. To what extent do portraits relate to the passing of time, as it does with Rembrandt? Y.P.M: You're right. Rembrandt is a master portrait artist, especially the self-portrait. He's an important artist in my eyes. He's not the only one. There are also French, Italian and Spanish painters like Goya, El Greco, Velázquez and Picasso.  E.C: The revealing and fierce strength in your pictorial expression, combined with the huge sizes of the canvases and the drama of your simplified color palette of white and black or white and red really emphasize the emotional burden that's conveyed by those depicted.  What are you most interested in drawing out from each character?

Y.P.M: In my opinion, the individual is the essence of humanity. A portrait allows the individual and their time period to be seen.  E.C: You stated on one occasion, ""What interest me about a person are their attitudes, fears and lives, which are often tragic."" Is the goal to feel less alone when facing one's fears and one's existence? Y.P.M: I'd like the world to share my anxiety and my fears.  E.C: In your series on killers -- people that randomly snatch life away -- what is it that interests you about them? Y.P.M: Animals have always fought to survive. I think that the same thing happens with man. Conflicts, wars and injustices are characteristic of man.   E.C: As an artist, where do you see beauty? Y.P.M: To me, beauty is found in painting. 
 
E.C: Your interest in Goya shows up in your reinterpretation of The Executions of May 3 or in Picasso, whom you've depicted. Have you been to the Prado Museum? What do you think of our Spanish masters? Y.P.M: I've visited the Prado Museum several times and it has impressed me every time. When I was at art school in Dijon, one of my professors, Jaume Xifrá, made quite an impact on me.  He was Catalan and spoke to me a lot about the Spanish painters.    
E.C: Do you believe that there's a dividing line, or at least some difference between the Chinese artists that left China after the Cultural Revolution and those that stayed? Y.P.M: There are differences between the artists that departed and those that remained. Without a doubt, their environments and lifestyles are different and therefore, their work is as well.  In regards to myself, I would say that, as of today, I am a nomadic artist without borders.  I am just an artist.   E.C: Your work deals with war and peace, money and globalization, capitalism and communism, with death as the backdrop. Is this your view of the world? Y.P.M: My view of the world is pretty pessimistic.  I don't believe in peace. Since the beginning of man, war has existed and it endures. It makes me think that man will continue fighting until the world is destroyed. Versión en Español.

ENTERTAINMENT,"The soft voice and otherworldly presence that Elle Fanning brought to “Somewhere,” “Maleficent,” “20th Century Women” and “The Beguiled” are magnified in John Cameron Mitchell’s new movie, “How to Talk to Girls at Parties,” mostly because she plays an alien unfamiliar with humans, who somehow don’t eat their offspring to sustain the species. Things don’t get more otherworldly than this. That’s just one oddity in the punk-rock bacchanalia based on Neil Gaiman’s short story of the same name. In the exclusive clip above, Fanning, playing Zan, takes the stage at a nightclub frequented by the movie’s human protagonist, Enn (Alex Sharp), and run by Queen Boadicea (Nicole Kidman, doing her best impression of David Bowie in “Labyrinth”). In the scene, Zan does not want to be thought of as a tourist on the punk scene — or as one just passing through Earth. She wants to understand the culture that she and her fellow colonists are exploring. Along the way, a little romance enters her life. “How to Talk to Girls at Parties” hits theaters May 25."
ARTS & CULTURE," The dance craze known as Flex originated in 1990s Jamaica with a man named George ""Bruk Up"" Adams. Adams' nickname -- ""Bruk Up"" is Jamaican slang for broken -- pays tribute to his childhood bone infection, which gave way to the adrenalized jerks and jolts that characterized his movement.  Adams immigrated to New York in the mid '90s and brought his signature moves, like the crabwalk, the shoulder pop, and the ghost walk, along with him. He hypnotized the New York dancehall scene, blending his moves with those of New York's hip-hop-infused streets. Thus, the genre of Flex was born: part vogue battle, part contortionist spectacle, part freaky-beautiful bodily storytelling.   Photographer Deidre Schoo discovered the underground dance phenomenon by chance, after being blown away by a dancer named Storyboard Professor in Harlem. The Professor told Schoo about Battlefest, the primary destination for extreme Flex meet-ups. Soon after, a photography project came to be.  ""The process could be rocky at times,"" Schoo explained to The Huffington Post. ""These are kids, and they are sometimes hard to track down, and keep crazy hours. But I hung around for so long and just kept showing up that, eventually, I was accepted and my presence became the norm. Once that happened, it got fun. The dancers were ready to work with me and really enjoyed the attention.""  Beyond its visual magnetism, Flex provides a creative outlet for many young people who may not have access to or interest in the more conventional artistic establishments.  ""Youth having creative support and an artistic outlet is paramount to evolution,"" said Schoo. ""The Flex community comes from a hard neighborhood. They are self-organizing and mentoring, thereby creating hope and options in a place where gang violence and police brutality is commonplace. The Flex movement is progressive and a movement of supreme style, love, life, youth and exuberance.""  Along with Michael Beach Nichols, Schoo directed a documentary about the world of Flex titled ""Flex Is Kings."" Schoo's photographs and film capture moments of pure, almost impossible movement. With twisting limbs and popping bones, the dance routines look more like spiritual possessions or medical oddities than traditional choreographed movements.  Whether captured via photography or video, Flex is utterly hypnotic, almost fantastical. ""Watching Flex is like being transported to another universe,"" Schoo said to Feature Shoot, ""where the hardship and monotony of daily life fades to reveal the bare, glittering bones of what makes us human. All body types and all ages are celebrated, and the dancers’ joy is infectious; in the intensity of Battlefest, suggests the photographer, all arguments are smoothed over and hidden truths disclosed against the beat of the music."" Take a look at the action-packed dance universe.   "
BUSINESS,"Since 2010, just after Thanksgiving each year, the digital publication Business Insider has convened a conference called “Ignition” in Manhattan. The event often features media luminaries discussing the future of digital businesses. Past conferences have included people like Amazon CEO and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos (who invested in Business Insider in 2013) and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. In the eight years that the conference has been held, it has featured 683 panelists. That group does not include a single black woman, according to a list of panelists published online by Business Insider and reviewed by HuffPost. It is not clear if some panelists were not listed on the website, and Business Insider spokesman Mario Ruiz did not respond to a HuffPost question on the matter. Ruiz also did not reply to multiple messages asking to confirm whether there had been a single black woman on any of the Ignition panels over the years. He told HuffPost the company aims to invite women of color every year, “including this year inviting Uber chief brand officer Bozoma Saint John, who was unable to join us.” Saint John did not respond to a request for comment. SiriusXM Radio Director of Progressive Programming Zerlina Maxwell said on Twitter that she was “not surprised” by the lack of black women among panelists. Not surprised. I've received calls for panels at the last minute when they realize they need diversity. This is the norm not the exception. https://t.co/e4iMErBlVe There is a diversity gap in media and digital industries. But there is no shortage of potential invitees for a conference like Ignition, including top executives at media companies like CNN and NBC, as well as prominent black women journalists and editors. While Asian women, Latinas and other women of color have had some representation over the years at the event, black women have been left out completely. Almost hard to do. https://t.co/l6LLvWApsn A section on the 2016 website for the conference describes it as “unscripted interviews, cutting-edge demos, and insights from industry pioneers” and says participants will learn “what key trends to be aware of and what you need to do to stay ahead.” This year’s conference, scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, is dubbed “The Future of Media” and features 80 panelists. Like past years, its lineup does not appear to include a single black woman. Panelists this year include New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet (who is black) and Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron. The conference will also feature powerful women in media, such as Janice Min, the former editor-in-chief and part-owner of The Hollywood Reporter, and Jodi Kantor, the New York Times reporter who helped break the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault accusations. “It is unfathomable that Business Insider can assert that they will be showcasing the best in media, marketing and technology yet include no Black women among its 80-person panel,” said April Reign, the activist who created #OscarsSoWhite. “One wonders whether concerted efforts were made regarding inclusion of marginalized communities or if Business Insider is simply uninterested in learning from diverse communities that drive billions of dollars of revenue in this country each year.”"

Last season's best off-Broadway musical is now this season's best Broadway musical.  Fun Home is the best Broadway musical in years.   Don't let the subject matter fool you. You might have heard that the Jeanine Tesori-Lisa Kron musical, adapted from the autobiographical ""graphic novel"" by Alison Bechdel, is about a lesbian cartoonist and her gay father who kills himself.  That might not sound like a cheery way to spend a couple of hours, but don't be misled.  Fun Home is an emotional roller-coaster ride, a grippingly heartwarming story mixed with some of the most smart and joyful musical numbers presently on Broadway.   Alison (Beth Malone) is, indeed, a 43-year-old lesbian cartoonist.  We also see her as the pre-teen Small Alison (Sydney Lucas) and the college-freshman Middle Alison (Emily Skeggs).  The nature of the narrative that Kron and Tesori have devised--and the beauty of the piece--is that we can see them all at the same time, in the same space, sometimes delivering the same sentence.  Small Alison grows up trying to communicate with her decidedly difficult father Bruce (Michael Cerveris); Middle Alison leaves home for college, where (a) she comes out, (b) learns her father is gay, and (c) watches as he commits suicide months later.  The adult Alison, meanwhile, struggles to make sense of it all.  While the three Alisons are central, Cerveris (of Assassins and Titanic) is the key to the proceedings.  As the repressed, unknowable father, he gives an excellent  performance so uncharacteristic that some viewers are likely not to even recognize him under the hairpiece.   The hidden strength of the show is Judy Kuhn (of Les Misérables and Chess), as the mother Helen.  Helen seems almost invisible in this family, her true self having dwindled over the course of the marriage.  Late in the show, she is revealed to have been very much aware of the situation all along; but what could she do other than sit at the piano, passively practicing Chopin?  ""Chaos never happens if it's never seen,"" she repeatedly notes.  Finally comes her song, which illuminates the show.  ""Days and Days"" is staggeringly good dramatic writing, and Kuhn--a three-time Tony nominee--is breathtakingly stunning.  The cast is rounded out by the two young brothers, Oscar Williams and the cute-as-a-button Zell Steele Morrow; Roberta Colindrez, as Alison's droll college girlfriend; and Joel Perez, as several young men for whom Bruce hungers.

The power of the story is enhanced by the songs, which mix passion with humor.  Tesori has previously demonstrated her abilities as musical dramatist with Violet and Caroline, or Change, as well as putting food on the table with the less challenging but more popular Thoroughly Modern Millie and Shrek.  The Fun Home score is monumental, revealing talent and sensitivity that is sustained throughout the piece.  The music blends perfectly with the lyrics of the heretofore non-lyric writer Kron (of Well), whose book and lyrics here are equally exceptional.   This is easily the finest theatre score in a decade, by my reckoning since The Light in the Piazza.  Tesori and Kron mix emotionally moving numbers with others that simply lift the roof off the theatre.  ""Come to the Fun Home"" is a comic knockout; appearing early in what thus far seems to be an overwhelmingly serious evening, the three pre-teens radiate blissful joy as they sing a pretend-TV commercial--in Jackson 5 style--for their family-run funeral home (hence, ""fun home"").  ""Changing My Major,"" delivered by Ms. Skeggs in the first throes of passion, is an irrepressible whirlwind artfully crafted with the sort of rhymes an 18-year-old might devise; and ""Ring of Keys,"" in which the Small Alison discovers the meaning of physical attraction, is so gloriously good that you can't imagine Tesori and Kron can top it until they hit you with ""Days and Days.""  Chris Fenwick leads a seven-piece band in John Clancy's sensitive orchestrations.  Fun Home originated at the Public's Newman Theater--home of the original productions of A Chorus Line, Elaine Stritch at Liberty and Hamilton--where it was wonderfully staged by Sam Gold (Circle Mirror Transformation).  Circle in the Square calls for a thoroughly different in-the-round staging, and in undertaking the challenge Mr. Gold has outdone himself: the show has grown stronger, and better.  The actors move and turn to face the patrons, of course; but Gold and designer David Zinn (The Last Ship) favor the in-the-round audience by also having the scenery move, rotate, and reappear in different places like cartoon panels.  The result is a greater immediacy that enhances the impact of the material.  As an added bonus, we can't help but see the thrilled reactions of audience members sitting opposite.

The transfer, eighteen-months after the Public opening, brings cast changes in the roles of Middle Alison and the two brothers.  The original girl, Alexandra Socha, was excellent but so is Ms. Skeggs, who replaced Socha midway through the Public run.  Skeggs appears to be younger, more awkward and unsure of her path, which plays very well.  The other Alisons reprise their excellent performances, although the 11-year-old Ms. Lucas appears noticeably older and taller than she was in 2013.  The boys, too, are just as charming as the earlier pair; the 8-year-old Morrow, dancing and whooping on a fun(eral) home casket while using a spray can of furniture polish as a microphone, is quite a sight.    The authors and director have seen fit to cut a favorite song from downtown, ""Al for Short.""  Which on reflection is the right choice; we learn the essential information from ""Ring of Keys,"" which has more emotional heft, and there is no room in a brisk 100 minutes to restate yourself.  It's highly uncommon, though, for present-day Broadway songwriters to cut an excellent song because they don't need it.   Seekers of provocative, invigorating and entertaining theatre--musical or dramatic--will find it at Circle in the Square.  To those who think that Fun Home doesn't sound like their sort of entertainment: this is musical theatre at its best, so go anyway.  You're likely to be surprised, and thrilled, and enthralled.

Jeanine Tesori and Lisa Kron's Fun Home opened April 19, 2015 at Circle in the Square "
POLITICS,"Honoring the Yale University tradition of wearing funky hats on graduation day, this year’s commencement speaker Hillary Clinton took the stage with a hat of her own ― a Russian fur hat, undoubtedly a swipe at President Donald Trump and the accusations that his campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election.  “I brought a hat too ... a Russian hat,” she told the students on Sunday as they whooped and cheered. “If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.” Clinton, a graduate of Yale Law School, offered a poignant address that encouraged graduates to channel their resilience and contribute meaningfully to the future of democracy.  She jokingly made references to the scandals that engulfed her campaign, noting that she made sure to bury a tape of her singing acapella during her Yale days so deeply, she quipped, that not even WikiLeaks would be able to find it.  “If you thought my emails were scandalous you should hear my singing voice,” she said.  She congratulated all of the students in the room, saying, “Even the three of you who live in Michigan and didn’t request your absentee ballots in time.” Clinton also made several mentions of her searing election loss. “No, I’m still not over it,” she said. “I still think about the 2016 election, I still regret the mistakes I made.” As a human being, she added, she is coping with what happened. But as an American, she’s concerned. “We’re living through a time when fundamental rights, civic virtue, freedom of the press, even facts and reason are under assault like never before.” Yet she did highlight the unprecedented levels of political and civic mobilization that have been kicked into gear since Trump’s victory, efforts she believes will help to defend democracy. “We are also witnessing an era of new moral conviction, civic engagement, and a sense of devotion to our democracy and country.” She urged students to demonstrate resilience even in simple ways, like in calling out fake news or subscribing to a newspaper to support quality journalism. And “as obvious as it seems, it means voting,” she added. “At this moment in our history, our country depends on every citizen believing in the power of their actions even when that power is invisible and their efforts feel like an uphill battle.”"
ARTS & CULTURE," Last year I had the pleasure and honor to become acquainted with Somi, an amazing jazz singer who was then about to release her album, The Lagos Music Salon. I found her to be thoughtful, sincere, and an awesome talent. I reviewed that album and a previous show on this page. Since then, I've watched her career continue to blossom, receiving accolades world wide, picking up many new fans and providing an example for empowerment and women's rights everywhere she goes. It has been a joy to behold. Last night she performed at The Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia -- my hometown. It was another stunning performance, this time with her excellent band using more spare arrangements, allowing her voice to soar with the most firm yet gentle support.  I welcomed the chance to catch up with her and see where her career has gone since last we'd spoken, and she was again gracious with her time. The following responses have been edited for length and clarity. When last we spoke, your album, The Lagos Music Salon, had just been released and you were in the crowd at another musician's performance. That was about 8 months ago. How has your life changed since then? With this being your second album, how has the experience been different?  Ever since the album's release, I've been given so many wonderful opportunities to share my music with both new audiences and long-time supporters.  I'm so very grateful for all of that, but not sure that I would say that my life has ""changed"" per se; only that I've been able to reach more and do more through my creative practice. I would like to believe every artist is interested in more expansive 'dreaming and doing' - it's a beautiful thing when there are clear markers of that along the journey.  This is actually my fourth album, but my first on a major label.  Obviously there is a certain type of social and cultural capital that accompanies that and which can open doors to even more visibility and career growth.  More than anything, I feel fortunate to be counted among a long list of artists I respect deeply on the label's catalogue.  As we'd discussed before, much of that album was inspired by the time that you'd spent 		in Nigeria, and you've also had travels in Africa recently. Can you explain your continuing 	connection with the continent, and how it affects your artistry? How were you received 		abroad this time? The majority of my very large extended family live in East Africa, so my connection to the continent is deeply personal.  Since I grew up mostly in Illinois, however, I became curious about my definition of ""home"" at a very young age.  My work, therefore, seems to always be in pursuit of the cultural space between both here and there; as I really do feel equally African and American.  I will say, though, that I feel more inspired on the African continent than anywhere else on this planet.  I think that has something to do with the knowing that we have so many stories that have yet to be told - stories that give a more balanced and whole picture of who Africans are and can be in today's world.  It's such an exciting time on the continent, no matter what industry you are in, and I love when I have the chance to plug into that energy and inspiration.  Hopefully 'The Lagos Music Salon' album has helped audiences reimagine the humanity of Lagos or any other modern African city. My recent trip was wonderful.  I spent 6 weeks traveling through South Africa, Uganda and Rwanda.  My time in East Africa was purely recreational and all about catching up with family.  In Johannesburg and Cape Town, however, I was working: performing, doing lots of press, and shooting a new music video.  South Africa has a deep musical history and love of jazz.  I love how passionate and open-minded their audiences are.  After performing there a few times, I've been able to connect with a really loving and growing fanbase there who really support what I'm trying to do.  It's definitely a country where, as an artist, I feel most at home.  I'll be heading back this spring and can't wait!  One of the things that stands out in your music is the way that you weave topical 			messages in with, for lack of a better descriptor, adult contemporary sensibilities. To what degree is that a part of your process? Ha! I can't help but laugh a bit at ""adult contemporary sensibilities.""  Whatever the sensibilities or aesthetic one hears in my music, it's not something I necessarily set out to do.  My music making is an organic process.  No matter what the subject matter of the song, I try to honor all of my musical influences - whether they be jazz, hip-hop, afrobeat, soul, or (dare I say it to) something that sounds both adult and contemporary. At the end of the day, I'm really just trying to tell stories and frame them as best I can.  You're at a point in your career now where you are starting to repeat appearances in 		certain cities. How does it feel, for instance, returning to Philadelphia, albeit in a new 		venue? It always feels great to come back to a city and have the chance to reconnect with and hopefully grow your audience in each place.  As a New Yorker, Philly feels like the next door neighbor that I never get to spend much time with or get to know very well, so I am really excited to spend more time there and in other East Coast cities on this tour.   Having witnessed your performances a few times now, I know how well you 			communicate specific and regional ideas into a common experience. The song, ""Ginger Me Slowly"" is one such example, which means to make one feel spicy and sweet. This is also your newest video release. Can you explain some of the ideas behind that production? How do you like making videos in comparison to making music? Well, I haven't made a lot of music videos, but it's an entirely different process than making music.  Mostly, I just love having the chance to think about and create a new performance of a song through a different medium and new creative dimension. I wanted the video for ""Ginger Me Slowly"" to have feel both intimate and artful.  I also wanted to do it in a way that made one think about how nuance hides in minimalism.  The song ""Ginger Me Slowly"" is about dreaming of a big and expressive kind of love, but it's also about learning to appreciate the simple yet meaningful declarations of that love.  When choosing a treatment, I decided to go with South African director Kyle Lewis because it seemed to evoke all of those things.  Hopefully audiences see that too! What was most surprising about your tour thus far? I love the surprises that sit inside of my band's improvisation every time we get on stage.  Even though we've performed the music countless times, they continue to inspire and push me in ways that make the songs feel like a nightly chance to rediscover something new in my own voice and the very stories I'm trying to tell. It's probably too early for fans to be expecting a new album, but have you made any 		plans yet for how you may approach your next project? Well, I recently collaborated with Lebanese-French trumpeter Ibrahim Maalouf on a song cycle about the role of women during the Arab Spring Movement.  We premiered the music at the Kennedy Center last May and really love the music so we're hoping to record it in the not-so-distant future. I've also just begun working on a jazz opera about the late South African singer and political activist Miriam Makeba. I'm not sure if and when that will become an album, but I'm looking forward to sharing more about that as it unfolds. Somi continues to tour, with upcoming dates in New York, Boston, Vancouver and returning to the continent of Africa to perform at the Harare International Festival of the Arts. Her latest music video, ""Ginger Me Slowly"" makes it's debut here."
POLITICS,"Nevada GOP Sen. Dean Heller’s campaign has paid his son, a social media influencer, more than $50,000 since July 2016, according to Federal Election Commission records. The payments to Harris Heller and his company, Heller Enterprises, were mostly for social media consulting, but they also include small reimbursements for travel and lodging. The Heller campaign said Harris Heller’s work for the campaign includes running their Instagram page – which has 1,337 followers – and making videos for Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The Nevada senator is considered the most vulnerable Republican running for re-election in 2018. A first-term Republican running in a state narrowly won by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, he is expected to face Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen in November. Paying family members with campaign funds is legal, as long as they aren’t paid more than market rate for the work and the work is for bona fide campaign services. But ethics experts have flagged the practice as problematic. It’s ensnared members of Congress from both parties, including GOP Reps. Kevin Cramer (N.D.) and Stephen King (Iowa) and Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush (Ill.). “A candidate or office-holder contracting with a family member raises questions about personal use of campaign money,” said Brendan Fischer, the director of federal and FEC reform at the Campaign Legal Center. “If a candidate can use donor money to fund the lifestyle of themselves or their family members, the risk of corruption goes up.”  Harris Heller isn’t a social media neophyte. He describes himself as “Musician/social media influencer” on his LinkedIn page, declaring: “If I’m not playing guitar, snapchatting or streaming on Twitch you should probably call the police.” He and his wife, the singer Kenzie Nimmo, have hundreds of thousands of followers on their YouTube accounts and were popular on Vine before Twitter shut down the latter service. They’ve appeared on The View and in ads for Gap, Coca-Cola and HP.   The Heller campaign defended the hire, saying the younger Heller produced most of the video content for the campaign’s social media accounts, shooting hundreds of hours of video. He has also started the campaign’s Instagram account and provides story-telling expertise that traditional campaign digital consultants lack. “Harris Heller produces quality content at a cheap discount to the campaign. He creates social and digital media for Fortune 500 companies,” spokesman Keith Schipper said. “He is an important part of our team, and we are lucky to have him.” The spokesperson said Harris Heller has produced 28 videos, including spots pushing the campaign’s tax reform message and showing his father’s extensive travels around the state.  The younger Heller has a YouTube page that went inactive in June 2017. Most of the videos on the page have between 1,000 and 3,000 views, although some have substantially more. One video, titled “I’m Doing a Nude Scene in Grey’s Anatomy,” has 16,000 views. Other popular videos include “Recording in Justin Bieber’s Studio” and “TOP 8 HIDDEN TRICKS IN POKEMON GO.” The payments to Harris Heller began in July 2016 and have continued into 2018. On its most recent FEC report, the campaign said Harris Heller earned two payments totaling $10,000 in February and a $2,500 payment in March. (The campaign said Harris Heller is paid $2,500 a month, although those payments are sometimes delayed.)  In the past, campaign finance reform advocates and ethics groups have called the practice “legally alright but morally kind of sticky.” Before his retirement, former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) introduced legislation seeking to ban the practice. It attracted no co-sponsors, and never saw the Senate floor."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Deadpool continues to surprise us with some terrific content. He painted some amazing landscapes as Bob Ross, and the “Merc with a Mouth” even suited up in pink to say a big f**k you to cancer. This time, he’s teamed up with the legendary Céline Dion for the music video “Ashes,” a song written exclusively for the upcoming “Deadpool 2” soundtrack. By the end, Deadpool is completely blown away by Dion’s performance, and that’s a problem. This is for a movie sequel, and that means she’s got bring her game way, way down. But Céline doesn’t phone it in for anyone.  “Deadpool 2” seductively dances into theaters May 18."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Alden Ehrenreich, the actor playing young Han Solo in “Solo: A Star Wars Story,” got pranked by none other than original Han Solo himself. Actor Harrison Ford recently snuck up on Ehrenreich during an interview with “Entertainment Tonight.” “You’re shitting me,” Ehrenreich said as Ford appeared next to him. “Oh my God.” “Get out of my chair,” Ford deadpanned. “Get out of my life!” Ford then gushed about Ehrenreich’s performance in the role he originated, calling it “spectacular.”  Even “Solo” director Ron Howard was surprised by the extent of the praise.  “I have to say, I’ve known Harrison a long time,” Howard told ET. “He can be great, he can be supportive. He’s never effusive.”  See the full meeting in the clip above.  “Solo: A Star Wars Story” opens on May 25."
BUSINESS," Fear is one of those things we’ve all experienced at some point. In times of physical danger, fear can literally save our lives. It triggers the most primitive part of our brain, the part responsible for alerting and protecting us from danger. Fear helps to keep us safe and alive. However, there are times where fear isn’t real, but something we create ourselves. The mind is powerful and what we tell ourselves influences our actions and reactions. For entrepreneurs or anyone brave enough to take a risk we create fear when we do not know the outcome of a certain situation. Why is that? Because we are afraid of the unknown and when we go outside of our comfort zone we feel scared. Understanding where that fear stems from is critical to overcoming it. Sometimes our fears are not even our own. Sometimes we allow others to project their own fears and insecurities onto us. We allow them to plant doubt in us and cause us to believe that what we want and what we’re capable of isn’t possible simply because they don’t believe it’s possible for them.  When that happens it’s important to be able to recognize it. You have to be willing to look within yourself and ask, “Am I really afraid of this and if so, why? Or have I allowed someone else’s limiting beliefs of themselves infiltrate my mind?” Until we unpack the root of the fear we will continue to allow the fear to paralyze us. Sometimes the only way to move forward is to be retrospective and look inward. Once we are able to recognize the source of our fear we can begin to work through it. Many of our previous experiences influence how we react in certain situations. So if our past experiences have been rooted in fear, chances are, so will our future experiences. Without taking the necessary steps to identify the source of fear you will always remain on the diving board and never take the dive. Jumping off that board and taking that leap can be scary, but it can also be exhilarating. Don’t allow yourself to be so overcome with fear that you never allow yourself the blessing of new experiences. Not everything of value in life comes from books. Take chances and experience the world. Be open to new experiences & challenges and know that even if you take the risk and fail it is only through experience that we ever really learn. The fear of failure prevents many from taking chances or starting something new. For some, the thought of failing can be paralyzing so instead of venturing forward and taking a chance, many choose to do nothing all in an effort to avoid failing. For others, it isn’t failing that frightens them it’s the thought of actually succeeding that they’re afraid of. When we succeed we now have set the bar to always perform at the level. The pressure that comes with being and remaining successful can be overwhelming and scary. We see it all the time with celebrities, singers, actors, or anyone in the limelight. One day they’re loved by everyone, selling out stadiums and platinum records and the next they end up on some reality show about has beens. Being able to manage failure is key to developing a success mindset. In my weekly podcast I talk about finding lessons in failure. Failure isn’t final. Failure is the Universe’s way of pushing us in the right direction. Failure is the Universe preparing us for the victory. Never get discouraged if you fail. Learn from it. Keep trying. Once we begin to understand that failure is a part of success the way we respond to failure changes. In life and in business perspective is everything. How you view yourself and what you believe yourself to be will influence your choices, actions, and eventually outcomes. If you believe you are a failure you will fail, but if you believe that you will win, eventually you will. Believing is half the battle, executing is the other half. The number of times you fail becomes irrelevant once you win. The only people who never win are the ones who quit and the ones who never try. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time. The ones who fail keep trying knowing that if they try enough times eventually they will get it right. Success is inevitable for the person who believes and never gives up. Don’t give up on your dreams just because it gets hard. It’s supposed to be hard and it will break you and it will make you question everything. It will make you doubt yourself and you will wonder if it’s worth it. In the end, it will be. Trust the process."
BUSINESS,"In another tense incident on a U.S. plane, an American Airlines employee was captured on video challenging a passenger to “c’mon, hit me” during a showdown on a flight from San Francisco. American Airlines issued a statement soon after flight 591 landed at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport Friday, confirming that it was investigating the incident that allegedly happened after a stroller struck a mother in the face. American said it was “deeply sorry” and that the worker has been “removed from duty.” Passenger Surain Adyanthaya filmed the below video, which begins with a woman seen in the front of the plane, crying while holding a baby. Adyanthaya said on Facebook that the stroller had struck the woman as a flight attendant roughly yanked it away from her while people were boarding. Another traveler can be heard saying in the video, “He smacked her in the face with the stroller.” “OMG! AA flight attendant violently took a stroller from a lady with her baby on my flight, hitting her and just missing the baby,” Adyanthaya said in the Facebook post. “Then he tried to fight a passenger who stood up for her.” ABC reported that the mother, who is reportedly Argentinian, may not have understood why her stroller was taken from her. In the video, which comes less than two weeks after a passenger was dragged off a United Airlines flight, a man and a woman can be seen speaking out on the mom’s behalf as she continues crying and asking for her stroller back.  At one point, a man with an identity badge around his neck, apparently the flight attendant who had taken the stroller, reenters the plane and speaks to the pilot standing by. Then the male passenger jumps up from his seat and points angrily at the airline employee, saying, “Hey, bud, you do that to me and I’ll knock you flat.” “Try it,” the worker aggressively says on the video. “Hit me. C’mon, hit me. C’mon, bring it on. You don’t know what the story is.” The pilot and the flight attendant are both touching the man, holding him back. “I don’t care what the story is,” the passenger responds. “You almost hurt a baby!” The woman and her children were escorted off the plane, according to Adyanthaya. American Airlines said in its statement that officials had launched the investigation after seeing the video, which “does not reflect our values or how we care for our customers.” Officials offered no other details about what happened, but the airline apologized to the passenger and her family. American placed them on another flight in first class and the company was “taking special care of her and her family,” the statement said. You can read American’s full statement below: “We have seen the video and have already started an investigation to obtain the facts. What we see on this video does not reflect our values or how we care for our customers. We are deeply sorry for the pain we have caused this passenger and her family and to any other customers affected by the incident. We are making sure all of her family’s needs are being met while she is in our care.  After electing to take another flight, we are taking special care of her and her family and upgrading them to first class for the remainder of their international trip.The actions of our team member captured here do not appear to reflect patience or empathy, two values necessary for customer care. In short, we are disappointed by these actions. The American team member has been removed from duty while we immediately investigate this incident.” On April 9 Dr. David Dao was violently dragged from a United flight in Chicago because the airline needed seats for traveling crew members. His lawyer said he suffered a concussion and broken nose, and lost two teeth in the shocking confrontation. United was roundly criticized for its handling of the incident. On April 11, CEO Oscar Munoz initially insisted in a statement that Dao was “disruptive and belligerent”  before later apologizing for the doctor’s treatment. @united @FoxNews @CNN not a good way to treat a Doctor trying to get to work because they overbooked pic.twitter.com/sj9oHk94Ik CORRECTION: Due to an editing error, this article initially misidentified a male passenger as Argentinian.

BUSINESS,"Exxon Mobil Corp. deliberately deceived the public about the dangers of climate change for four decades, a new Harvard University study finds. For the peer-reviewed study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters Wednesday, two Harvard researchers analyzed nearly 200 documents related to Exxon Mobil’s climate change communications. The researchers found that America’s largest oil producer had repeatedly made “explicit factual misrepresentations” about global warming in advertisements aimed at the general public, while simultaneously acknowledging its risks behind closed doors.  “Our findings are clear: Exxon Mobil misled the public about the state of climate science and its implications,” study authors Naomi Oreskes and Geoffrey Supran wrote in a New York Times op-ed this week. “Available documents show a systematic, quantifiable discrepancy between what Exxon Mobil’s scientists and executives discussed about climate change in private and in academic circles, and what it presented to the general public.” The discrepancy, the researchers said, was staggering. About 80 percent of Exxon Mobil’s research and internal memos acknowledged that climate change was real and caused by humans. However, 80 percent of the company’s newspaper ads regarding climate change questioned this fact, the study found. An internal Exxon Mobil memo penned in 1979, for instance, acknowledged a possible link between fossil fuel combustion and an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Another memo from 1982 described “potentially catastrophic events” that could arise from climate change, such as the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet. A peer-reviewed study conducted by Exxon Mobil scientists in the 1990s concluded  “the body of evidence ... now points towards a discernible human influence on global climate.” Another one from 2002 found that limiting atmospheric carbon dioxide levels could be needed to “forestall coral reef bleaching, thermohaline circulation shutdown, and sea level rise.” But in 1997, the same year that the Kyoto Protocol was adopted, Exxon Mobil released an ad that called the science of climate change “too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.” A 2000 Exxon Mobil advertorial in The New York Times described climate change as an “unsettled science.” The oil giant has previously defended itself by saying that it has never “suppressed climate change research.” But Oreskes and Supran said in their study that “the question is not whether Exxon Mobil ‘suppressed climate change research,’ but rather how they communicated about it.” Exxon Mobil’s peer-reviewed studies about climate change weren’t widely distributed or readily available to the general public, while their ads were meant to reach millions, the researchers noted. The company had “really good scientists,” Oreskes, a history of science professor, told the Times. “That finding then makes the contrast with the advertorials that much more notable.” The study comes as Exxon Mobil faces several lawsuits and investigations related to its transparency, or lack thereof, regarding climate science. Reacting to the Harvard study, Exxon Mobil called the research “inaccurate and preposterous.”   “Our statements have been consistent with our understanding of climate science,” said spokesman Scott Silvestri in a statement, according to Agence France-Presse news agency. Silvestri added that the researchers had “cherry-picked” data to “attack” Exxon Mobil’s reputation. Speaking to the Times, he highlighted two Exxon Mobil ads that had suggested that climate change “may pose” long-term risks. The scientists, however, rejected Silvestri’s claim. Supran told AFP that they’d “looked at the whole cherry tree” in their research, including the ads that the spokesman had mentioned. While Exxon Mobil did publish some ads that suggested potential risks associated with global warming, the “predominant stance taken [in the company’s climate change] advertorials is ‘Doubt,’” said the study, which was funded by the Rockefeller Family Fund.  Following the publication of the Harvard paper on Wednesday and the related op-ed, the hashtag #ExxonKnew began appearing on social media. The hashtag first gained popularity in 2015 after InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times published reports alleging that the oil had purposefully covered up what it knew about climate change. BREAKING: A new peer-reviewed study conclusively finds that Exxon misled public about climate science. https://t.co/hh1mK4uCM1 #ExxonKnew pic.twitter.com/LbpVC8jLuB Since then, numerous investigations at the state and federal level have been launched and lawsuits have been filed related to whether Exxon Mobil deceived the public or its investors about the risks posed by climate change, both to the environment and to its business.  Last month, three communities in California sued 37 oil, gas and coal companies including Exxon Mobil, Shell and Chevron for their alleged contributions to sea level rise and for concealing the hazards posed by global warming. The companies “have known for nearly a half century that unrestricted production and use of their fossil fuel products create greenhouse gas pollution that warms the planet and changes our climate,” the complaint reads. ″They have nevertheless engaged in a coordinated, multi-front effort to conceal and deny their own knowledge of those threats, discredit the growing body of publicly available scientific evidence, and persistently create doubt in the minds of customers, consumers, regulators, the media, journalists, teachers, and the public about the reality and consequences of the impacts of their fossil fuel pollution.” "
POLITICS,"Sarah Huckabee Sanders tried to guilt feminist Democrats into backing CIA deputy director Gina Haspel to head the agency — despite accusations of past support for waterboarding — because she’s a woman. “I’m sorry, my eyes cannot roll back enough in my head,” New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg quipped on an MSNBC panel Sunday. Goldberg was responding to a tweet by Sanders, which called “any Democrat who claims to support women’s empowerment but opposes” Haspel’s nomination a “total hypocrite.” There is no one more qualified to be the first woman to lead the CIA than 30+ year CIA veteran Gina Haspel. Any Democrat who claims to support women’s empowerment and our national security but opposes her nomination is a total hypocrite Goldberg slammed Sanders for “playing the woman card” despite Donald Trump and his administration’s record on women. Goldberg was affronted by the twisted outrage “that there is no kind of feminist in America who is rooting for the first female waterboarder to take power.”  She was taken aback that the “most sexist administration in modern history” was “going to play the woman card.” Goldberg added: “They’re not supportive of women.” Check out the comments in the video above. Goldberg responds at 1:40. Haspel has come under fire from both parties — and men and women — for a history at the CIA that includes links to waterboarding.  The Washington Post reported Sunday that Haspel offered to withdraw her name from consideration to head the CIA to spare the agency’s reputation — and her own — and to dodge possible confirmation defeat. As the head of a clandestine base in Thailand in 2002, Haspel oversaw the interrogation of a terror suspect that reportedly included waterboarding. Haspel also allegedly played a part in destroying tapes of the session.  Several Twitter responses to Sanders’ comments about backing Haspel took the same perspective as Goldberg did: That’s a joke right? No, Democrats are entirely legitimately asking about her running a Thai black site allegedly to torture people. Her gender is completely irrelevant to that particular question. https://t.co/uCG0fEjF8X I don’t think people who believe in women’s empowerment believe that any woman will do for any job and I don’t think you think they believe that. No one’s objecting to her because she’s a woman -women’s “empowerment” doesn’t mean ignoring her disqualifications . Women’s empowerment means judging women on their merit the way we judge men on theirs. It’s abt having a say in decisions that affect our lives. But since u say it’s abt supporting ALL women ALL the time, when can we expect your meeting w/ Stormy, Hillary & Michelle? #hypocrite    "
POLITICS,"Anyone? Anyone know that Donald Trump’s protectionist tariffs will increase costs for American consumers? That’s the message from U.S. retailers who launched an ad on Monday inspired by a scene from the cult classic “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.”  Economist and actor Ben Stein ― “Ferris Bueller’s” memorably impassive teacher ― stars in the new ad, explaining that tariffs are “B-A-D economics.” A “student” in the ad, which you can watch above, suggests that Trump’s tariffs will “raise prices on everything from clothes to cars. I guess it’s pretty serious.”  The ad by the National Retail Federation ends: “Tell Washington: tariffs are B-A-D economics.”  The ad began airing Monday on “Fox & Friends,” and will air this weekend on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” and ABC’s “Roseanne.” The Trump administration has already imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum and newsprint that have raised costs for newspapers and a variety of manufacturers. Experts predict that higher prices will affect all consumers. Matthew Shay, CEO of the retail federation, warned that a trade war will erase the benefits of tax cuts “and result in higher prices for a wide range of consumer products.” As for jobs, “the new tariffs are likely to lead to a net loss in U.S. employment,” the Federal Reserve Bank of New York concluded in a blog post last month. The post cited an earlier report citing a similar effort in 2002 that cost some 200,000 American jobs.  The steel industry — which the tariffs are expected to help — employs some 140,000 workers. Steel-intensive manufacturers that employ some 2 million workers are expected to be hurt by the tariffs. Public hearings on the tariffs are planned this week before the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Trump, meanwhile, appears to be stepping up to save jobs in China by hinting he’ll remove sanctions against the Chinese phone company ZTE. The issue is likely a bargaining chip in hammering out a new trade understanding with China, The Washington Post notes."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Last week, people of color mobilized on social media to spread awareness of the alarming number of black and brown young women currently considered “critically missing” in Washington, D.C.  The viral effort, along with sharing facts regarding the missing teens, encouraged others to question why cases about missing black women often go uncovered by the nightly news and other mainstream media sources. “As a society, we only pay attention when a particular type of woman goes missing,” artist Kenyatta A.C. Hinkle told The Huffington Post.  For years, Hinkle has used her artistic practice to explore black female bodies ― how they navigate multiple geographies simultaneously and how they react to the narratives and perceptions thrust upon them. Her current exhibition, titled “The Evanesced,” features 100 drawings, which Hinkle describes as “un-portraits,” evoking black women who have gone missing, whose bodies and lives have been erased.  The show has been on view at the California African American Museum since early March, before the recently heightened scrutiny over D.C.’s missing girls. But for Hinkle, the work’s timeliness is far from surprising. “It’s not a strange coincidence because this erasure happens every day, all over the nation,” she said. “It has been a state of emergency for a long time. It just depends on who is looking at it and who is talking about it.” Before “The Evanesced,” Hinkle created a series called “The Uninvited,” based upon 19th-century photographs of West African women taken by French colonialists. The images depicted their subjects monolithically and aggressively, propelling myths of black women as hypersexual and primitive, coercing their bodies into poses that fit the fantasy.  Using intricate lines and watery clouds of color, Hinkle disrupted the colonialist narratives, transforming the photographed women into goddesses, monsters and hybrid creatures in between. The images simultaneously alluded to the violence being enacted within the photos while eclipsing it with power, beauty and wrath. “I could feel things from those photographs,” Hinkle said. “I’m an empath.” The colonialist photos, which were printed on postcards and widely distributed throughout Europe, plainly communicate the degree to which men assumed ownership of and agency over black women’s bodies. Not much has changed, Hinkle believes, between the 19th century and today. “I have this mantra of looking at the historical present,” Hinkle said. “I’m always between these two places, where our past and present collide. If we don’t recognize our history, we’re constantly going to be in the residue of it.” Hinkle began formulating her concept for “The Evanesced” after learning about the case of Lonnie Franklin Jr., also known as the “Grim Sleeper,” a serial killer convicted of killing at least 10 black women in the Los Angeles area between 1985 and 2007. “He amassed a private archive of almost 1,000 photos of women,” Hinkle said. “Police are still trying to identify what happened to them.”  Franklin’s photo trove triggered memories of the unnamed, unidentifiable black women depicted in the colonial postcards. “I started thinking about what it means to be erased in a contemporary context,” Hinkle said. “What does it mean to emerge from this kind of erasure?” The deeper the artist dug into her research, the more horrific the findings were. Hinkle claimed that in 2010, 64,000 missing black women remained unfound, citing a number that made its rounds on the internet in the years since; she described the number as “unfathomable, sublime.” When her peers learned she was researching missing black women, they shared stories of other cases and names. The black female bodies kept piling up.  For Hinkle, “The Evanesced” is about more than the Grim Sleeper, or the missing D.C. girls, or any one person or case. As she put it: “If I draw these women, then what about the others?”  Additionally, the artist didn’t want to portray a real person, a real life ripped away, without doing the proper legwork. “I would want to spend time with the families and get to know them,” Hinkle said. “I am very critical of someone who comes into a community and makes work about it. I wouldn’t want someone to say, ‘That doesn’t look like Rachel.’ Then you are further erasing her.” The sentiment rings especially true following the controversy surrounding Dana Schutz’s painting of Emmett Till’s open casket, currently on view at the Whitney Biennial. Schutz, who is white, has been accused by some artists and critics of erasing Till’s image by rendering it in paint, and exploiting black suffering by painting a story that is not her own. And even if Hinkle wanted to render portraits that were grounded in real life, the numbers are just too high. “Sixty-four thousand missing women,” she said, “there is no way I could make a picture of that.” The drawings, then, don’t represent 100 actual missing women, but evoke what it means to be a black body erased. “It’s about this idea they are shrouded in erasure,” Hinkle said. “These cases, we don’t talk about them, or we focus on the killers. But these women, these presences, are more than that.” In her studio, Hinkle lined up pieces of blank, recycled paper. She then turned on music ― Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Kanye West’s “Life of Pablo” were favorites ― and began to dance. Using India ink and a brush she fashioned from Spanish moss, Hinkle let her intuition guide her as she put marks on paper, dancing figures ― or as she called them, presences ― into being. “I wanted to make this kind of being that is flesh and not flesh,” Hinkle said. “Becoming and unbecoming, defined and not defined. There is this push and pull between both worlds.” The gestural figures that emerged from Hinkle’s body and subconscious mind look like apparitions as much as real people, their trembling bodily outlines giving way to ink-stained abstraction. The black lines veer from fine and airy to coarse and wet, resembling rays of spirit from one angle, bodily scars from another. Some women dance, some braid hair, some curl up in a ball as if cowering in fear. “I wanted there to be this gamut of expressions — joy, pain, love,” Hinkle said. “These imagined movements that can’t be contained.” In his review for The Los Angeles Times, Christopher Knight likened Hinkle’s minimalist style to that of 20th-century Austrian artist Egon Schiele. The mythic woodcut prints of Alison Saar also come to mind, as do the ghostly drawings of Alina Szapocznikow.  Lined up in five rows of 20, the delicate drawings are devastating in their abundance, though they pale in comparison to the number of real women whose bodies have disappeared. “It’s kind of unfathomable,” Hinkle said. “The exhibition is about what I can never really grasp. For every woman there is a family, a mother and a father. For every image there is an infinity of erasure.” On opening night, Hinkle watched as viewers entered the space, stopped short and sighed, as the weight of the work hit them. In the days since, black women have reached out to Hinkle on social media to let them know how much the work affected them. “People have told me about coming to the show and crying in the space,” she said. “That gives me chills because I’ve spent so many nights crying.” “Kenyatta A.C.

ARTS & CULTURE,"To watch an Apichatpong Werasethakul film is to be lulled into a dream. His latest film, Cemetery of Splendour, which premiered at Cannes this week, immerses you in a surreal, and yet real, world on the line of wakefulness and sleep: literally a hospital (once a schoolhouse), in the Thai town of Khon Kaen, where 40 soldiers are interned for ""sleeping sickness,"" occasionally waking only to tumble into slumber, even mid-meal. Jenjira, a middle-aged woman with a damaged leg, takes care of one of  these sleeping soldiers, a comatose man named Itt. For much of the film, she is patiently kneeling by Itt's bedside, and caressing his hand.   The spectator drifts into a magic quiet state with the palm trees swaying in the windows, the cicadas chirping, the sounds of the fan. At one point, a woman comes to the hospital to teach mediation:  ""Feel the energy of the stars,"" she says soothingly. ""And bring that energy inside you."" As she spoke, I did the same in my chair. The surreal aspect is upped step-by-step. A pretty young medium comes and communicates with the unconscious of the soldiers, confiding to Jen that the soldiers' souls have been taken by a warrior emperor to fight his battles, one thousand years before. The hospital, she states, is built on the remains of a cemetery of kings. Later this winsome medium takes Jenjira through a forest, pointing to the leafy ground: The site, she says, of palace rooms, which the sleeping Itt seems to have mapped out with strange squares and circles in a notebook. In another scene, Jenjira travels to pray at a shrine, laying down figurines as offerings. Two young girls come to thank her for her offering; they are princesses of the shrine, they tell her. 1,000-year-old princesses. Indeed, they are dead.  Jenjira lifts an eyebrow.  At points, the film becomes a series of sublime installation pieces, playing with color and light to enhance the limbo of dreaminess. My favorite sequence is that of a series of shots of the lit town at night: a neon light over a bus-stop, illuminating a poster of a wedding studio advertisement, and  the night ""therapy"" lights on the sleeping soldiers (designed by the director), that look like long fluorescent loops and change from blue to green to red.   I also like the random images that don't make sense. A machine in the lake that spits up brilliant drops of water. A giant amoeba floating in the sky. The men at the side of the lake who suddenly stand up and move in various formations. A movie theater where, at the conclusion of the film, the entire audience stands up, as if in military salute. The director has noted that many of the images in the film are those of his own memories in this town: the local movie theater, the school classroom we see in ruins, the brightly lit night market where the medium and Jenjira chat and eat. A Cemetery of Splendour is a collage of his native Thailand, the layered memories of the past, both his own and that of the nation. Still, there is something unsettling about this dream. Everyone seems to be waiting. But waiting for what? Something -- beyond cemeteries -- is buried under the surface. While the images are serene and whimsical, and the film an exquisite pleasure to watch, I intuited a disturbing subtext to this hynoptic world -- especially since  Apichatpong Werasethakul introduced the premiere, on stage, by speaking about how difficult it was in Thailand now, living under a dictatorship. I met with the director to discuss.  Five years before, we met to discuss his Palme d'Or winner Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, and enjoyed a whimsical brainstorming about the images in his film.  This time Apichatpong Werasethakul was more serious and pointed.
Could you please explain the contemporary context of Thailand, for a non-Thai audience?

Thailand has a lot of coup d'etats, repeatedly. Every time it happens a lot of people die; the last one was just last year, in May, when the military took over. Now, if you say something against the government, they will convoke you to ""Attitude Adjustment"". You have to sign something that says you will not say anything again.   Why this emphasis on sleep and dreaming in your film? I have been interested for the last five years in sleeping and dreaming. For me, the act of sleeping is an act of escape, and that is what is going on now in Thailand: One wants to escape from the country. Sometimes you feel very powerless, in that all you can do is go away.  I work on many projects, art projects. Sometimes you cannot deal with reality, and you don't know if it is a dream.  Sometimes the situation in Thailand is so absurd and so violent that I feel threatened... There are a lot of random elements in the film, that don't entirely make sense. Could you please explain, for example, why everyone suddenly stands up to salute in the theater? Because we are always standing up in Thailand! We have to stand up at eight in the morning for the National Anthem.   Why the palace in the forest? Why the cemetery under the hospital?  Thailand is a young country, with many layers of civilizations: the Kingdom of Laos, the Khmer of Cambodia. I want to present those layers of history. We don't live in only one reality, but in different layers of memories. I want the film to reflect on and lament the ruins of past kingdoms.   In Thailand, we do not know the roots of who we are.  We have been taught propaganda history in school: ""We are the best,"" etc. Did you note that image in my film of the bas relief of soldiers? It was a wall created to commemorate a prime minister who died a long time ago, Sarit Thanarat. He was a total dictator. He embezzled a lot of money. Along the way, he killed people.  The town is still celebrating him!

Your film, like your previous films, has ghosts and other supernatural elements... In this region of Thailand, we are very superstitious. We are Hindu, Animistic. You believe in the invisible. People live in the fantastic. I will give you an example: A road once cracked in the village.  It became a very strange shape. People put candles on the crack and started to pray. They believe in the spirit; they need to worship the invisible.   But do you believe in the other-worldly elements in your film: The ghost princesses who come to Jenjira, for example? (AW laughs) Oh, I think it is all nonsense. For me, it is a joke. But the character is ready to believe they are phantoms. Many Thai people believe in phantoms -- it is so funny how people are ready to believe in anything. But in my film, there is no judgement. As for me, I am interested in the different parallel universes, of time and space. What is that machine spitting water bubbles in the lake, and why do you have such a lengthy close-up on it? (AW  laughs) Oh, that is a water propeller, a machine to keep oxygen in the water, for the equilibrium in the water, so it does not go bad. Why did I put it in?  Oh, I grew up with it; it was always there in the water.  And the soldiers are like the fish: They, too, need oxygen. Water is life, the cycle.

What is everyone waiting for in this film? They are waiting to wake up."
ARTS & CULTURE,"On Nov. 2, New York Times columnist and noted husband of his former research assistant David Brooks graced the American reading public with his musings on the current wave of public sexual harassment allegations. Brooks’ column was quickly mocked across social media, especially his choice to dub sex “a golden nugget” and his normcore take on arousing pop songs. But what’s really odd and befuddling about his take was this blithe lede: “The world seems full of sexual predators these days.” Brooks doesn’t explain the basis for implying that there are more sexual predators today than before (in fact, even the recent accusations against film producer Harvey Weinstein and several other high-profile men span many decades), or for later asserting that the line between men seeking sexual pleasure and men preying on unwilling women is “blurrier” now than in the past. Presumably sexual harassment was easy for Brooks to ignore before the news cycle became saturated with it. In this, Brooks fell prey to the sort of ahistoricism that certainly isn’t new, but which has felt intrusively ubiquitous during this painful, exhausting year. Everything is worse than it has ever been; we have never needed salvation more than we do now. America’s standing in the world, political divisions, race relations, treatment of women ― evidence notwithstanding, mainstream discussions often take for granted that these things have never been at a lower ebb. Perhaps the most representative phrase for a year in opposing Trump is, fittingly, “Now more than ever.” Over the past 12 months, the media, institutions and public figures have worn the phrase out, leaving “now more than ever” a brittle husk, a cliché that conjures an eye roll rather than a sense of urgency.  After the election of President Donald Trump, we needed the arts now more than ever; we needed a free press now more than ever; we needed comedy now more than ever; we needed political dialogue now more than ever. Each individual cause or pursuit that seemed distasteful or trivial in the new state of political panic had to be defended, and each time the defense was the same: The very environment that makes this seem unimportant is the reason that it’s important.  By March, The Washington Post declared that “now more than ever” had to go. Of course, since then, we’ve found that we need robust missile defense, immigrant workers and young people voting in local elections ― now, more than ever. “Now more than ever” leverages the weight of history while simultaneously turning away from it. To say that we have never been in such dire straits is a powerful statement because history is long and full of dire straits ― plagues, genocides, wars ― and yet now is somehow worse. But that assertion only holds up as long as one doesn’t actually look back on those plagues, genocides and wars. We can say that America is in the lowest place we can remember, but it likely requires us to forget or downplay events in our own lifetimes, from the Jim Crow era to the September 11 attacks. We can imagine that sexual harassment is a new problem, but that requires us to ignore the Anita Hill hearings, the accusations against Bill Clinton and, frankly, the entire history of men having power over women. This attitude is somehow both nerve-jangling and soothing. It’s like declaring bankruptcy: A painful road lies ahead, but you have permission to forget about any embarrassingly awful turns you made to arrive here. Shocked Trump was elected? Surprised about the sexual harassment faced by all your female colleagues? Blindsided by the rise of the white nationalist movement? Don’t waste time grappling with the fact that you didn’t bother to vote, or sat silently when your male coworkers made sexist jokes, or ignored the targeted aggression faced by black women online in recent years. Focus on the particularly fierce urgency of now.   Both Trump’s slogan, “Make America Great Again,” and the rallying retort from his opponents, “America Is Already Great,” traffic in this sort of convenient amnesia: Either way, America starts from a base point of greatness. Either way, its ugly roots in mass genocide, human trafficking and forced labor have been swept aside. The winners write the history books, and in America the winners have always been white men. Even when human rights for the oppressed have triumphed, powerful white men on both sides have been motivated to minimize the past injustices and to glorify their own roles. Many of the narratives now accepted as common wisdom were composed with a power-consolidating agenda. These narratives demonize or ignore people of color; they sow distrust of women’s words.   With the racist backlash to the election of President Barack Obama, followed by the election of Trump, who has used rhetoric favored by white nationalists, white Americans have been confronted with a racial divide in the country that our national mythologists had been working for centuries to paper over. It seems worse now than ever; it’s not. Before, though, the suffering of people of color, and especially black people, was submerged beneath our self-congratulatory national narratives. Men have been similarly blindsided by the recent wave of sexual assault and harassment allegations against industry leaders ― or, at least, blindsided that anyone cares. Brooks isn’t the only one to wax astonished at this new wave of sexual misconduct. But the crimes existed before this month, and the perpetrators were enabled and protected by willful ignorance and anti-feminist cultural narratives.  “This tsunami of stories doesn’t just reveal the way that men have grabbed and rubbed and punished and shamed women; it shows us that they did it all while building the very world in which we still have to live,” wrote Rebecca Traister last month. She noted, in particular, the spate of sexual harassment allegations against political reporter Mark Halperin ― a man whose book, Game Change, largely defined the narrative of the 2008 election.  “The same power that afforded Halperin the ability to allegedly rub up against younger colleagues,” wrote Traister, “also meant that he got to shape the nation’s view of a woman whose political story had already been shaped by other men who abused their power.” His take on Hillary Clinton, she pointed out, was a harsh, nuance-free portrait of “a grasping and scandal-plagued woman.” His coverage of Trump, in the 2016 election, was relatively flattering. He downplayed sexual harassment claims against Trump; now the public has learned that Halperin behaved similarly with younger female colleagues. Halperin’s power to shape political narratives has taken a severe hit. A planned book on Trump’s campaign was scuttled by Penguin following the allegations, and HBO dropped a planned movie based on the book. But, as Traister notes, we still have to live with the narratives he propagated. Consider the 2016 Democratic primary. Even as the party is undoubtedly divided and in disarray, postmortems are met with annoyance and outrage from whichever group was satisfied with existing narratives. When Bernie Sanders supporters spent the weeks after the election chorusing, “Bernie would have won,” centrist Democrats were dismissive. When Clinton came out with a book about her 2016 campaign, critics across the political spectrum sniped that she needed to go away and be quiet rather than pick at the party’s wounds. This is framed as a call to “move on” or to “look ahead,” and can be directed at anyone, on any side of the divide, who wants to re-litigate an aspect of the primary. But perpetually looking ahead, or ― still worse ― looking only at the present moment, only ensures that we will continue to live with damagingly false ideas about our past.  And, as William Faulkner wrote, the past is never past. We continue to live within societies and institutions shaped by what has happened to us. In 2014, Ta-Nehisi Coates published a powerful case for reparations in The Atlantic. “Won’t reparations divide us?” he wrote. “Not any more than we are already divided. The wealth gap merely puts a number on something we feel but cannot say ― that American prosperity was ill-gotten and selective in its distribution. What is needed is an airing of family secrets, a settling with old ghosts.” Until we fully reckon with the crimes of America’s history, and reconstruct a national identity that incorporates a full understanding of them, he argues, those crimes continue to reverberate throughout our society.  “Now more than ever” and its attendant naïf posture about the longstanding ills of American culture and politics are paper over the cracks in our foundations. They’re stories we tell ourselves to explain away the damage we’ve found as a surface flaw. But fixing our country requires more than excuses and misdirection. Now, as ever, it requires us to look fearlessly into our past and be honest about what we see there."
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — A high-ranking political appointee at the Department of the Interior told colleagues their job is ultimately to protect their boss, Secretary Ryan Zinke, internal emails reveal ― in particular from matters that could trigger an ethics probe or negative media attention.  In the March 28 email exchange, Daniel Jorjani, a former Koch brothers adviser whom Zinke appointed as his principal deputy solicitor, raised concerns over a $4,000 bill for a staffer’s six-day trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands. The staffer, Russell Roddy, was the agency’s director of scheduling and advance until he quit in January. Roddy had traveled to the Virgin Islands in preparation for a trip Zinke took in late March and early April.  The exchange, released as part of an open records request, occurred less than a month after Zinke took over the agency. It starts with a rather blunt email from Roddy explaining in detail why he needed to stay on the islands for nearly a week. “I may not be good at a lot of things,” he told Jorjani, “but one thing I know I am good at is efficiently planning and executing events and advance.” Roddy’s email paints a picture of a frustrated and overworked employee. In his note to Jorjani, Roddy said he was “in dire need of a vacation.” (Two months later, as Interior Department staff made last-minute travel arrangements to ensure Zinke’s wife could join him for a dinner in Anchorage with Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, Roddy wrote to several colleagues: “UGH! We have all kinds of planes, trains and automobiles manifests to now scramble with.”) Roddy left under unclear circumstances, Politico reported at the time. In his reply, Jorjani was understanding, writing “Rusty - Not your fault.” He cast blame on another staffer for failing to prepare the paperwork in advance of the trip. What seemed to worry Jorjani most was the possibility of an investigation by the agency’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and how such a probe could reflect on Zinke.  “$4,000 for a six day advance in the Virgin Islands is not a small sun [sic] and will draw the OIG’s attention. (OIG loves travel investigations. They are easy to document and spin in a negative way),” Jorjani wrote. Jorjani boasted that he had experience fending off such internal investigations, noting that he had “worked and successfully protected” Interior presidential appointments who had undergone investigations from the internal watchdog. Jorjani noted that approval was sought only after Roddy departed on the trip, and he stressed the importance of properly documenting travel. “Otherwise,” he wrote, “it will be easy for the OIG or the Washington Post to spin things negatively.”  “At the end of the day,” he added, “our job is to protect the Secretary.” Interior spokesperson Heather Swift said that the email “speaks for itself.” Jorjani did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.  The email provides a peek into Zinke’s inner circle, suggesting some appointees view their role as gatekeepers who must first and foremost protect the secretary against ethics scandals.  Jorjani previously held senior positions at the Charles Koch Foundation and Charles Koch Institute and most recently worked as general counsel at the Koch-supported Freedom Partners. A top legal operative at Zinke’s Interior Department, Jorjani’s calendar shows he met extensively and communicated with industry lobbyists, trade groups and corporate executives.  In December, he was involved in rolling back several Obama-era regulations, including authoring an interpretation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act that protects energy companies and other parties from being prosecuted for unintentionally killing birds. The oil and gas industry praised the decision. Jorjani also decided to renew controversial leases for the Twin Metals copper and nickel mine in Minnesota following a lobbying blitz by the leaseholder, Chilean company Antofagasta, Plc. Zinke and his team have faced mounting criticism over their spending, travel and apparent conflicts of interest. The inspector general investigated Zinke’s use of private planes at taxpayers’ expense — a controversy the secretary shrugged off as “a little BS” — and concluded that he ”generally followed relevant law, policy, rules, and regulations.”  Among the trips that have been heavily scrutinized was his 2017 visit to the U.S. Virgin Islands for the 100th anniversary of the transition of power from Denmark ― the trip Jorjani was worried about Roddy spending so much time and money planning. While there, Zinke flew on chartered planes, at a price of $3,150, and attended a Republican fundraising event ― one of several instances that have earned him accusations of mixing work with politics."

Dave Thomas Brown and Afton Williamson in The Legend of Georgia McBride.
Photo: Joan Marcus  Those roars of laughter you hear on Christopher Street, just now, emanate from Matthew Lopez's unexpectedly sharp comedy The Legend of Georgia McBride, now at the Lortel.  Lopez, whose last local offering was the thought-provoking Civil War drama The Whipping Man (from Manhattan Theatre Club, in 2011), is in a decidedly less noble mood here.  Georgia McBride is not high literature, no, nor is it especially well-made; but it offers highly delicious low comedy, as satisfying as an icy-cold brew in a redneck bar on Florida's Panhandle. Georgia McBride takes place, in fact, in a redneck bar in Panama City, along the Gulf of Mexico and not far from the Alabama and Georgia borders.  (The title character's name, it turns out, is poached from the latter state.)  Casey (Dave Thomas Brown) is a personable but not-very-good Elvis impersonator, struggling to keep himself and pregnant wife Jo (Afton Williamson) out of bankruptcy.  With few customers coming in, weathered proprietor Eddie (Wayne Duvall) invites his cousin Tracy (Matt McGrath) to provide an alternate source of entertainment, thus axing Elvis--and Casey. Tracy -- who arrives in company with Rexy, more formally named Anorexia (Keith Nobbs) -- switches over to a drag policy.  When the latter arrives one night way too drunk to perform, Casey is unwillingly pressed into action as a not-very-impressive Piaf.  The money is so impressive, though, that the soon-to-be-dad gets into the act and proves to be an expert impersonator under the moniker ""Georgia McBride.""  Trouble arrives seven months later, when the very pregnant Jo turns up at the bar to surprise her husband.   This is all punctuated by the drag scenes, which get better and better (and funnier and funnier) as Casey/Georgia masters the trade.  (The musical selections range from the usual suspects to Sondheim; a Sweeney Todd quote gets a large laugh, although that might just be on Christopher Street.)  More importantly, this is a very human comedy; Casey is sweet if not-too-bright, Jo is lovely, and the needless-to-say wisecracking Tracy has one of those hearts of gold.  Lopez ends his play on a heartwarming, family-friendly note The performances are all winning.  McGrath and Brown shine in the showiest roles, with the others offering equally fine portrayals.  Williamson is thoroughly believable as the wife who is blindsided by her husband's occupation; Duvall adds humor as the redneck barkeeper who proves as much of a ham as the others; and Nobbs effectively doubles as anorexic Rexy -- with an especially effective monologue late in the proceedings -- and as Casey's not-very-bright landlord/friend.

The laughs stream along under the direction of Mike Donahue, in what appears to be his first major New York job.  Donahue directed the play's premiere production in January 2014 at the Denver Center Theatre Company, with McGrath in the cast.  Set designer Donyale Werle, of Peter and the Starcatcher, is also a holdover from Denver.  Costume designer  Anita Yavich and choreographer Paul McGill get in on the fun in the drag sequences.

A comedy about drag queens might have a somewhat limited audience.  The Legend of Georgia McBride, though, is not so much a comedy about drag queens, but a comedy which incorporates characters who happen to be drag queens.  Mark this as another winner from MCC Theater.  Like past offerings such as Wit, reasons to be pretty, The Other Place and Hand to God, this one seems a likely prospect for extended life.   .

Courtesy of the artist and Kate MacGarry, London. Francis Upritchard's Alternate Universe at MUMA, Melbourne About 85 million years ago, New Zealand broke off and floated away from Australia and Antarctica. Isolated for millennia, the islands' plants and animals evolved in peculiar ways--giant, flightless birds, ground-walking bats, and enormous, carnivorous snails ruled the land. It's as if the island developed in an alternative history. Likewise, the lanky, multicolored figures that inhabit the world of New Zealand-born sculptor Francis Upritchard also seem to have evolved out of a different history, with their own esoteric garb, body decoration, rituals and artifacts. Upritchard's uncanny yet familiar world, however, springs forth not from a faraway, isolated land, but from the artist's interior and intuitive process.

Upritchard's work is currently the subject of a major survey exhibition at Monash University Museum of Art, in Melbourne, Australia. Despite being one of New Zealand's most successful international artists--she won New Zealand's prestigious Walters Prize in 2006, represented the country at the 2009 Venice Biennale, and has enjoyed major solo exhibitions in museums around the world, including the Vienna Secession in 2009, Nottingham Contemporary in 2012, Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Centre in 2012, MIMOCA in Kagawa, Japan, in 2013, and the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, in 2014--she has rarely exhibited in Australia, New Zealand's closest neighbor. The exhibition at MUMA, titled ""Jealous Saboteurs,"" brings together nearly twenty years of her work, with rarely seen and significant early works along with recent sculptures.

Upritchard was born in 1976 in New Plymouth, New Zealand, but has lived in London since 1998, after graduating from Christchurch's Ilam School of Fine Arts. Living in London but retaining close ties to New Zealand, Upritchard's work seems preoccupied with the notion of colonial empires and their repositories of artifacts. Early works include shrunken heads mounted on small brass or wooden pedestals, their teeth grotesquely protruding from gummy resin jaws, hair patchy, but intact. In Upritchard's world though, the shrunken heads appear to belong to the mustachioed white colonialists, rather than the natives, from whom their ceremonial preserved heads were usually pilfered for display in Western museums (there is currently an effort to repatriate the mokomokai, preserved heads of the Māori, held in private and museum collections around the world, back to New Zealand). Do Upritchard's heads appear as a kind of colonial comeuppance in her alternate history? These things are left up to the speculation of the viewer--the heads themselves say nothing.

Courtesy of the artist and Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tamaki. In Upritchard's alternative anthropological museum, the method of display is a matter of prime significance. Jealous Saboteurs, from 2005, is a collection of rummage sale hockey sticks carved into toothy crocodile talismans, and arranged like trophies or tribal curios for inspection. Her sculptures of sloths, with their preposterously elongated limbs, recline under stodgy glass vitrines, like taxidermied oddities in a natural history museum belonging to another evolutionary history. In other works, figures are arranged atop cabinets and sideboards, in the manner that a shrewd collector might casually display his cultural loot.

Courtesy of the artist and Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tamaki. The plinths on which so many of Upritchard's figures are perched, in many cases, contribute greatly to the overall dynamic of the work. In recent years, she has collaborated with her partner, Italian furniture and interior designer Martino Gamper, on the bespoke tables, plinths, and other supports for her figurative sculptures. The care taken in the aesthetic choices of furniture reveals Upritchard's interest in craft, further evidenced by her attention to textiles, lamps, jewelry, urns, and other accoutrements. In Upritchard's sculpture, it is not enough for the figure to be sculpted from clay and set upright--the drapery, adornment, and environment related to the figure are integral to the work itself.

Upritchard's recent works feature a carnivalesque cast of characters--harlequins, hippies, soldiers, seers, and gurus--some life-size, adorned with colorful fabrics, headdresses, and elaborate body paint. With their heavy-lidded eyes and aquiline noses, some look oddly familiar, as if drawn from the collective unconscious, a late night fever dream mixing up Harry Potter with a Picasso portrait come-to-life. Upritchard's references derive from historical sources vaguely recalled before her process of sculpting by intuition takes over, and renders her figures wholly idiosyncratic and unique. The knights of the Bayeux tapestry become empty-handed medieval marionettes enacting a mysterious dance.

Courtesy of the artist and Kate MacGarry, London. While Upritchard's style is indisputably her own and her works seem to originate from an alternate universe only she is privy to, her work does not exist in a complete vacuum. Other figurative sculptors preceding her surely figure strongly in the development of her work: Bruce Conner's mummified relic Child (1967), Paul Thek's vitrined, armored body parts and supine, life-size hippie entombed, to name two. In fact, one of Upritchard's works, entitled Paul (2009) a figure on his back with coin-shaped objects placed on his body, clearly pays homage to Thek's famous 1967 work The Tomb. Contemporaries of Upritchard also seem to share her interest in creating alternate worlds populated by Technicolor figures--a kinship can be seen in the sculptural works of Ryan Trecartin and Lizzie Fitch, and the mythological future world envisioned by the artist Saya Woolfalk.

Courtesy of the artist and Kate MacGarry, London. Upritchard's world resists easy categorization or explanation. Historical details are subsumed by individual, intuitive aesthetic choices. The sculptural object is complicated by the use of found objects and detritus, and by adornment and decoration. Her figures seem to belong to a wholly different culture, that may have evolved somewhere in an alternate universe, or perhaps developing some time in the distant future, creating their own relics from the cast-offs of our current material culture. Though their precise meanings remain ambiguous, Upritchard's figures, artifacts, and installations offer an attuned, critical look at how we signify, apprehend, and display culture. ""Francis Upritchard: Jealous Saboteurs"" is at MUMA, Melbourne until April 16, 2016. It opens at City Gallery Wellington, Te Whare Toi on May 28 and runs until October 16, 2016. --Natalie Hegert

ARTS & CULTURE,"Just one week after its three-episode premiere, Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” has already been renewed for a second season, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The outlet notes that the show is Hulu’s most-streamed premiere to date; and it’s been a critical success, too, racking up a 92 percent rating on Metacritic.  In an interview with HuffPost last week, showrunner Bruce Miller said that the story’s themes, though timeless, were sure to resonate with contemporary viewers. He said the show will lead fans to “appreciate the freedoms that we have, and see little ways that they’re chipped away and what that can lead to.” In addition to its at least two-season run, the show has Elisabeth Moss signed on for a five-to-seven-year contract, a commitment she made with the condition of working as a producer, with a say in casting decisions.  So, how will a multi-season adaptation of a single novel play out? On a panel at the Tribeca Film Festival, Miller noted that while one of the book’s merits is its close focus on Offred’s personal story, that also means there’s room to explore the world beyond her perspective.  “I wanted to know what happens next,” he said of the novel’s abrupt ending. “The end of the book is quite a mystery, so I get to make it up.” It bodes well for future seasons that Atwood has been involved with Hulu’s take on her story, even appearing as a shadow-shrouded disciplinarian in one scene.  And, there have been possible hints at a sequel to the book, although this might be no more than wishful thinking on the part of her many avid fans. "
ENTERTAINMENT,"The Charmed Ones are back. The CW announced last year it was working on a reboot of the hit series “Charmed,” and now it has summoned an official trailer. Instead of Prue, Piper and Phoebe, the trailer introduces us to Mel, Maggie and Macy. “Charmed” 2.0 is already setting itself apart from The WB’s 1998-2006 incarnation, putting women of color in the three lead roles. Sarah Jeffery plays Maggie, Melonie Diaz is Mel, and Macy is portrayed by Afro-Latina actress Madeleine Mantock. Fans of sister CW show “Jane the Virgin” should note that the supernatural showdowns are being executive-produced by “Jane” creator Jennie Snyder Urman. And seeing as that show is ending next year, the Power of Three may have the magic cure to fill the telenovela hole in your heart. This iteration of “Charmed,” per Shadow and Act, has Mel as “a graduate student in the women’s studies department her mother heads at Hilltowne University” while “Maggie is a freshman considering rushing a sorority (to Mel’s bemused dismay) and going ‘on’ again with her on-again off-again boyfriend Brian.” The trailer takes us through the tragic death of Marisol, their mother, and the discovery by her two daughters of a third, older and previously unknown sister, Macy, who is a “brilliant geneticist.” All three sisters appear to have supernatural powers mostly like the original trio: Mel can freeze time (like Piper), Macy is telekinetic (like Prue) and Maggie can hear others’ thoughts (unlike Phoebe, who had the power of premonition).  HuffPost caught up with the OG Piper, Holly Marie Combs, who has spoken out about the reboot before. Combs told HuffPost that while she appreciates “the jobs and opportunities the ‘Charmed’ reboot has created,” she doesn’t understand “what is fierce, funny or feminist in creating a show that basically says the original actresses are too old to do a job they did 12 years ago.” “I hope the new show is far better than the marketing so the true legacy does remain,” she told us. “Reboots fare better when they honor the original as opposed to taking shots at the original. Reboots also do better when they listen to a still passionate fan base which is what it’s all about, isn’t it? That’s why we do reboots. The fans are why we all get to do what we do. So we wish them well and hope for success.” Hear, hear, Holly! As for what mayhem the revised trio will get up to... the devils are in the details. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated Phoebe in the original “Charmed” could hear others’ thoughts. In fact, she had the power of premonition. This story has been updated with comments from Combs."
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — David Bernhardt, the deputy secretary of the Interior Department, met late last year with a trio of lobbyists for MGM Resorts International, the casino-resort giant that his longtime former employer also represents.  The meeting with lobbyists from Ballard Partners, which came two months after Bernhardt met with another lobbyist for MGM Resorts, raises still more ethical concerns involving the former energy lobbyist at a time when Secretary Ryan Zinke and his team are facing mounting criticism over their spending, travel and apparent conflicts of interest. Bernhardt is barred from participating in matters involving his former employer, lobbying firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber & Schreck, per the ethics agreement he signed last year. But, according to a newly released calendar, Bernhardt had a Dec. 19 meeting with Brian Ballard, a Florida lobbyist who raised millions of dollars for President Donald Trump’s campaign and was hired by MGM in March 2017 to lobby the Department of the Interior on issues including “Indian Gaming & Expansion Policy.” Joining Ballard at the meeting were Sylvester Lukis and Dan McFaul, who are both partners in the lobbying firm. All three are registered to represent MGM, which paid the firm $350,000 for its services over the last year, according to lobbying disclosure reports. The calendar does not say what their meeting with Bernhardt was about.  Brownstein Hyatt, where Bernhardt worked for eight years prior to being sworn in at the Interior Department in August, has also been representing MGM on this issue since he was with the firm. The meeting with Ballard Partners came two months after Bernhardt met with Gale Norton, another lobbyist for MGM, as HuffPost first reported. The casino hired Norton, the interior secretary under George W. Bush, to lobby the department specifically on MGM’s opposition to a proposed casino partnership between two Connecticut tribes, the Mashantucket Pequot and the Mohegan. MGM, which is prepared to open a casino in nearby Springfield, Massachusetts, views the tribes’ casino as competition. Because the tribes’ proposed casino would not be on Indian land, federal approval is required. Larry Jensen, a lawyer at Brownstein Hyatt and former Bernhardt colleague on the firm’s energy, environment and natural resources team, also met and held several phone calls in December 2017 and January 2018 with Bernhardt’s right-hand man, James Cason, the associate deputy secretary. Cason, Jensen, Bernhardt and Norton all worked in the Interior Department in the mid-2000s.  McFaul denies he and his colleagues talked with Bernhardt about MGM. “We’re aware that he’s recused from this matter, and we respect that,” McFaul told HuffPost.  According to McFaul, the meeting was about a different tribal casino that his firm represents, SkyBoat Gaming. Ballard, Lukis and McFaul are each listed as a lobbyist for SkyBoat.  Lobbyists from Ballard Partners met with Bernhardt on two previous occasions, in September and October. The deputy secretary’s calendar specified the meeting topics ― Everglades Agricultural Area and Skyboat Gaming, respectively ― while the December meeting did not state a specific purpose.  Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist for the progressive watchdog group Public Citizen, told HuffPost that Bernhardt’s meeting with Ballard lends further evidence to the suspicion that Bernhardt is not complying with his ethics agreements. “Bernhardt’s frequent meetings with lobbyists who are deeply entangled in the turf war between MGM and the tribal casinos, especially the meeting with the MGM lobbyist, gives every appearance that Bernhardt is personally involved in negotiating public policies that directly impact MGM and his former lobby firm,” Holman said. Had Bernhardt met only with Ballard Partners, which lobbies the federal government for numerous clients other than MGM, the Interior Department could put up a credible denial that the parties discussed the casino, Holman said. But his previous meeting with Norton, who solely represents MGM in its fight against the proposed tribal casino, would cast doubt on that argument. “This ‘drain the swamp’ was nothing but campaign rhetoric,” Holman said. Meanwhile, MGM’s lobbying blitz seems to have been successful. In September, the Interior Department refused to make a decision on the Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan casino within the required 45 days, a deadline that expired just two weeks after Zinke hosted Ballard and several other lobbyists for a social gathering on his office balcony overlooking the National Mall, Politico reported. The tribes have filed suit against the Interior Department seeking a firm yes or no on the project. The Interior Department did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment Wednesday. "
BUSINESS,"Ride-hailing giant Uber says it will offer city planners and other researchers a rare peek behind the curtain and open up access to its trove of traffic data. The new service, called Uber Movement, is essentially a dashboard through which users can interact with anonymized trip data in aggregate, allowing researchers to study both broad traffic patterns and more granular neighborhood data on an hourly basis throughout the day. Uber’s motive here isn’t purely altruistic. In addition to helping government officials better understand their cities, the company undoubtedly hopes the information will lead to smarter infrastructure investment decisions, thereby benefiting Uber as well. “We don’t manage streets. We don’t plan infrastructure,” Andrew Salzberg, Uber’s chief of transportation policy, told Wired. “So why have this stuff bottled up when it can provide immense value to the cities we’re working in?” Uber initially opened the service to Manila, Philippines; Sydney; and Washington, D.C., as a trial, and says it will add more cities in the coming weeks. Eventually, the company says Movement will be “freely available to the public.” While Movement’s potential benefits are great, traffic planners may want to temper their expectations. A similar program implemented by Uber in Boston in 2015 has so far failed to deliver, with The Boston Globe concluding it has “not lived up to [the] hype so far.” “While the data has been very useful in understanding the growth of [transportation network companies] and their service profile in the city,” Boston CIO Jascha Franklin-Hodge told The Boston Globe, “we’ve not had a lot of big success in putting the data to use in a more planning-oriented context.” It’s interesting timing for the announcement. Last week, Uber sparred publicly with the New York City Taxi & Limo Commission, which wants access to the company’s rider destination data, something it currently requires of taxis in the city. "
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — In May 2017, a little more than a week after President Donald Trump signed a pair of unpopular executive orders threatening the future of 27 national monuments, the Interior Department announced it was giving the American public a chance to weigh in. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke boasted that the comment period “finally gives a voice to local communities and states,” parties the Trump administration claims past presidents ignored when granting protections to new monuments under the Antiquities Act of 1906.  And after the comment periods closed in July, Zinke said he appreciated “everyone who took the time to log-on or write in and participate in our government,” and that the input would help inform his decisions. But internal documents show that in the case of Bears Ears National Monument, the administration conducted its review assuming it had little, if anything, to learn; that it had all the information it needed to decide the fate of the Utah site.  Randal Bowman, a senior policy analyst at the Interior Department, led a May 31 webinar to train a dozen agency staffers on how to read and catalog public comments the agency fielded on its review of Bears Ears, a 1.35 million-acre monument the Obama administration established in late 2016. During the hour-long training, Bowman told the review team that because the Utah monument was so new and a management plan had not yet been adopted, it would be “virtually impossible” for a member of the public to submit information that hadn’t previously been considered. “Essentially, barring a surprise, there is no new information that’s going to be submitted,” Bowman told staffers, according to a video of the event. A link to the webinar was included in an email released as part of a public records request. When one member of the review team asked Bowman to clarify his previous comment, he said, “I can’t visualize what a new [piece of] information would be. But I’m not ruling it out.” From the start, Trump and Zinke’s public criticisms suggested Bears Ears wouldn’t survive intact, and that the administration’s review and public comment period was mostly for show. At the April signing ceremony, Trump said the Bears Ears designation “should never have happened” and that he was going to free up the land to “tremendously positive things.” Still, the Interior Department maintained its review would be fair and thorough. Bowman’s comments during the training, as well as subsequent internal emails, are likely to add to critics’ speculation that the outcome — at least for Bears Ears — was predetermined; that the administration was not really interested in what the general public had to say. Bowman and the Interior Department did not respond to requests for comment. In a report summary made public in August, Zinke acknowledged that the vast majority of the 2.8 million public comments his department received as part of its sweeping review favored maintaining national monuments. But he chalked up that one-sidedness as being the result of “a well-orchestrated national campaign organized by multiple organizations.” The administrative review culminated with Trump traveling to Utah in December, where he announced he was slashing Bears Ears by 85 percent, opening the door for new mining, drilling and other development. Nearby Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, the largest land national monument in the country, was cut roughly in half. The rollback was the largest reduction of national monuments in history. Interior Associate Deputy Secretary James Cason tapped Bowman, a senior policy analyst who’s worked at the department for more than 30 years, to lead the review process in early May, documents show.  Bowman is among several Interior Department career staffers who quickly rose within Trump’s ranks, as The Washington Post reported. The Post noted Bowman is known among some of his colleagues as “the cicada,” a supporter of limited government who “goes underground during Democratic administrations.” In 2008, Bowman was involved in a scandal in which Interior Department officials meddled in the listing of endangered species. To make easy work of analyzing public comments on the monument review, the Interior Department hired software company Texifter LLC. An online summary of the $23,387 contract is dated May 23. As Bowman and Stu Shulman, president of Texifter, highlighted in the May 31 training, the platform allowed reviewers to mark comments as either supporting or opposing the review, as well as flag any that went beyond an expressed opinion and offered new information.  Bowman wrote in a May 6 exchange with Downey Magallanes, a top aide of Zinke who also played a key role in the review, that he expected the comments to be ” 99-1 against any changes.” “We will need to know within a few weeks how you want the substantive ones handled ― short summary, just list them by source ― name of group or individual, particularly impressive ones (if any) set aside for Secretary [Zinke] to read or not, etc.,” Bowman added. Because Trump gave Zinke a much shorter deadline to make an initial recommendation on Bears Ears than other monuments impacted by the review, Bowman and his team initially focused their attention on those public comments. Of the approximately 59,000 comments specific to Bears Ears, the vast majority — 95 percent — voiced opposition to Trump making changes to the monument, according to an internal email. About 54,000 comments were submitted as form letters or petitions and were easily categorized. The remaining 5,000 or so were unique and had to be individually reviewed by Interior Department staff. On June 4, a little more than a week before Zinke submitted an interim report recommending Trump shrink Bears Ears, Bowman flagged what he described as “perhaps the only substantial new information submitted on Bears Ears.” That comment came from Jim Carlson, a managing partner at Stillwater Technical Solutions, a consulting firm based in Garden City, Kansas. Attached was a report that the commissioners of San Juan County — staunch opponents of the Bears Ears monument designation — paid Carlson $53,000 to produce. It was published in October 2016, roughly two months before President Barack Obama designated the protected site in southeastern Utah. In the lengthy document, Carlson and his co-authors put forward a slew of arguments for why they thought Obama did not have the authority to establish the Bears Ears area as a national monument. At the time, a coalition of five Native American tribes that consider the area sacred was petitioning Obama to set aside 1.9 million acres. It is named after a pair of towering buttes and among the most archaeologically-rich sites in the nation.  “If the [President of the United States] has authority to designate a monument of any size, shape, or area — for any reason — then what is to stop POTUS from withdrawing large swaths, regions, or even entire States under the cover of the Antiquities Act?” Carlson and others at Stillwater wrote in their conclusion. Although the report contains more information than the vast majority of comments, it was not new, as Bowman suggested. And it seems highly unlikely that no other substantive information was submitted as part of the review. Take this comment, submitted May 25, in which dozens of environmental and natural resources law professors provided a detailed argument for why presidents do not have the authority to abolish, shrink or otherwise weaken national monuments. It’s also important to note that San Juan County officials hired Carlson to produce the document as part of their fight to prevent a monument from being established in the first place.  Carlson told HuffPost that he met with the Obama administration ahead of its 2016 designation and believes his findings ultimately resulted in the administration opting to designate 1.35 million acres rather than 1.9 million. He added that he was not surprised to learn Interior Department officials in the Trump administration gave special attention to his report.  “We are really a significant researcher in natural resources,” he said. “That would stand to reason that they would flag that and use our material. To our knowledge, we know of no one in the country that does our level of research.” It is unclear if Carlson’s report influenced Zinke’s recommendation or Trump’s final decision on Bears Ears. Carlson said he was not contacted to discuss the findings."
BUSINESS,"By Gina Cherelus (Reuters) - Driverless vehicles operated by Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] were back on the road in San Francisco on Monday after one of its self-driving cars crashed in Arizona, the ride-hailing company said. Uber’s autonomous vehicles in Arizona and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, remained grounded but were expected to be operating again soon, according to a spokeswoman for the company, who refused to be identified. “We are resuming our development operations in San Francisco this morning,” she said in an email. Uber’s San Francisco program is currently in development mode. It has two cars registered with the California Department of Motor Vehicles, but is not transporting passengers. The spokeswoman said because of this, the company felt confident in putting the cars back on the road while it investigates the collision in Arizona. On Friday, Uber suspended its pilot program in the three states. A human-driven vehicle “failed to yield” to an Uber vehicle while making a turn in Tempe, Arizona, said Josie Montenegro, a spokeswoman for the city’s police department. “The vehicles collided, causing the autonomous vehicle to roll onto its side,” Montenegro said in an email. “There were no serious injuries.” Two “safety” drivers were in the front seats of the Uber car, which was in self-driving mode at the time of the crash, Uber said on Friday, a standard requirement for its self-driving vehicles. The back seat was unoccupied. Photos and a video posted on Twitter by Fresco News showed a Volvo SUV flipped on its side after an apparent collision involving two other, slightly damaged cars. Uber said the images appeared to be from the Tempe crash scene.   (Reporting by Gina Cherelus; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Dan Grebler)"
BUSINESS,"Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder will lead Uber’s investigation into sexual harassment claims made by an ex-employee, the company told its workforce on Monday.  In an email obtained by Reuters, The Guardian and other news organizations, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick told his employees that Holder will lead an “independent review” of the claims that former Uber engineer Susan Fowler made in her now-viral blog post, as well as broader diversity issues at the company.  “It is my number one priority that we come through this a better organization where we live our values and fight for and support those who experience injustice,” Kalanick wrote in the memo, according to The Guardian. Fowler, who wrote about the year she spent working at the ride-hailing company, described an office culture that permitted rampant sexual harassment and gender discrimination, and a human resources department that did little to protect her and her female colleagues. At one point, Fowler says, she was told she was on “thin ice” and in risk of being fired if she continued to report cases to HR.  “I reported his threat immediately after the meeting to both HR and to the CTO: they both admitted that this was illegal, but none of them did anything,” Fowler wrote. Holder will be joined by his colleague Tammy Albarran, who is also a partner at the law firm Covington & Burling. Kalanick also said Uber board member Arianna Huffington, as well as the company’s human resources chief, Liane Hornsey, and the company’s associate general counsel, Angela Padilla, will help conduct the internal review.  After reading Fowler’s blog, Kalanick responded in a statement to HuffPost, “What she describes is abhorrent and against everything Uber stands for and believes in.” In his memo to employees, the Uber CEO said that women make up 15 percent of the company’s employees. Fowler said that just 3 percent of the engineers were women at the time she left."
ENTERTAINMENT,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hip hop producer Russell Simmons and an aspiring documentary filmmaker have agreed to dismiss her civil lawsuit claiming that Simmons raped her at his Los Angeles home in 2016, court documents filed on Wednesday showed. The case, filed in January in U.S. Court in Los Angeles, was dismissed with prejudice, meaning it cannot be filed again. The filmmaker, Jennifer Jarosik, had accused Simmons of forcing her to have sex with him after she refused his advance. She had sought $5 million in damages. Simmons has denied the accusation. Simmons’ attorney Patricia Glaser declined comment. An attorney for Jarosik did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Several women have accused the 60-year-old Def Jam Records co-founder of sexual misconduct dating back to 1983, including four who said he raped them. Simmons has denied all of the accusations."
BUSINESS,"By Paul Feldman, FairWarning More than 4,800 American workers are killed on the job each year. But in states that were carried by Donald Trump, the chances of dying at work are higher than in states that Hillary Clinton won. With a single exception, the states that voted Republican had at least three job-related deaths per 100,000 workers, according to the most recent federal labor statistics for 2015. In all but two states that went Democratic, the workplace death rate was less than three. Two states that Trump won by landslide margins, North Dakota and Wyoming, had the highest fatality rates of 12.5 and 12.0 per 100,000 workers, respectively–more than four times the death rates of most states that went for Clinton. A key factor, experts say, is that red states tend to have a higher percentage of hazardous blue-collar jobs, while the more urbanized blue states have more white-collar and service jobs. “The big cities where Hillary got most of her votes are not where the foundries, the mills, the logging, the mines are,” said Adam Finkel, a former OSHA official now at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. And with the Trump Administration and Republican Congress pledging sweeping cuts to federal regulations, which they say will spur economic growth, some analysts warn that workers in states that voted for Trump could be in greater peril. “Workers and citizens in states in which a majority voted for Trump have much to lose if the Trump Administration weakens enforcement or reduces support for health, safety and employment standards,” said Professor Thomas A. Kochan, co-director of MIT’s Institute for Work and Employment Research. “Trump states have, on average, weaker state level laws and enforcement agencies than do states that have stronger Democratic histories.” Since the relatively small number of workplace deaths can give rise to random variations, particularly in low population states, analysts caution against giving too much weight to the statistics. Nevertheless, the most recent data follow a pattern of death rates being higher in the South and Appalachia and lower in New England and the West Coast, said John Mendeloff, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs. “Where workers are lower paid, not as skilled, easier to replace, that probably gives lesser incentives for safety to employers,” Mendeloff said. “In other words, the costs of accidents are lower.” The pattern is strikingly similar to the link between state voting preferences in the November election and traffic death rates. As FairWarning reported earlier this month, the states that favored Trump consistently had higher traffic fatality rates than the states that backed Clinton. Since the Occupational Safety and Health Administration was created in 1970 during the tenure of President Nixon, workplace deaths have shrunk nationwide from 38 a day to 13, agency data shows. During that period, which also saw the enactment of such measures as the Mine Safety and Health Act, the death rate for miners has dropped by more than 75 percent, according to research by the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low wage workers. Although Trump’s controversial first nominee for labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, withdrew and his replacement R. Alexander Acosta has yet to be confirmed, efforts to scale back workplace protections are already underway. The Senate is expected to vote in coming days to strike down an Obama-era rule requiring businesses seeking federal contracts to disclose previous labor violations –anything from wage-and-hour abuses to workplace hazards. The move would come under the Congressional Review Act, which Republican lawmakers are using to target a number of environmental and health rules enacted during the Obama administration. Also vulnerable is an OSHA regulation requiring companies to submit workplace injury rates for posting on the Internet. Interest groups including the national Chamber of Commerce and the National Chicken Council last month filed suit in federal court in Oklahoma to have the measure overturned. OSHA has yet to reply to the lawsuit, and it’s uncertain how, or if, the agency will defend the rule. But in a sign of the times, among the first people dispatched by the Trump administration to the Labor Dept. was longtime business lobbyist Geoffrey Burr, who as a vice president of Associated Builders and Contractors fought both the requirement for federal contractors to disclose labor violations and the electronic filing of injury rates. Business groups contend that federal regulations are weighing down the economy. According to Eric J. Conn, a Washington D.C. attorney who specializes in defending OSHA cases, government rules “when taken collectively, can stifle job growth.” Cutbacks in labor protections would reverse the approach of the Obama administration, which stepped up enforcement and upgraded safety standards for exposure to silica, beryllium and other hazards. “If they start cutting back on enforcement and do fewer inspections, I think that will likely lead to more workplace deaths,” said David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor in charge of OSHA during the Obama administration. “Many employers don’t need OSHA to motivate them to protect their workers, but others clearly do.” “Where are the trenches and where are the derricks?” Finkel asked. “The hazards are in the red counties and so that’s where the death toll will rise if all of a sudden there was no enforcement or if there was a rollback of existing regulations.” For whatever reason, workplace death rate statistics for 2015 almost precisely mirrored 2016 presidential voting results. The only red state with a death rate lower than 3.0 was Arizona (2.4). The lowest death rates were in dependably blue states ranging from the very largest to the very smallest –California at 2.2, Washington and Massachusetts at 2.1, Delaware at 1.9 and Rhode Island at 1.2.

ENTERTAINMENT,"Actor Clayne Crawford’s outbursts on the set may have proved lethal. The actor was fired from “Lethal Weapon” as the buddy-cop TV series finished its season on Tuesday, according to The Hollywood Reporter. And it wasn’t looking good for his character, Martin Riggs, who was shot in the chest in the just-aired finale, TVLine noted. Warner Bros. Television producers are attempting to find a replacement for Crawford as Fox prepares for a presentation to ad buyers on Monday, Variety reported, citing unnamed sources. “You can’t fire me on my day off!” Crawford cried on Twitter. Wait, wait, wait......you can’t fire me on my day off! Crawford revived the role made famous by Mel Gibson in the 1987 “Lethal Weapon” movie opposite Danny Glover’s Roger Murtaugh, who’s played by Damon Wayans in the TV series. Crawford recently apologized for two on-set eruptions over working conditions, and completed studio-appointed therapy. “I am incredibly sorry if my passion for doing good work has ever made anyone feel less than comfortable on our set, or feel less than celebrated for their efforts,” Crawford said. “Furthermore, I apologize to all the crew and cast for any negative attention ‘Lethal Weapon’ is receiving because of these incidents.”"
ENTERTAINMENT,"Streamline recommends “Moonrise Kingdom” as the movie you should watch on Hulu this week. The service adds this on Sept. 16. “Moonrise Kingdom” stars two unknown child actors ― Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman ― along with a notable cast of adults that includes Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand and Bruce Willis. Wes Anderson directed this and co-wrote the screenplay with Roman Coppola. The two children run away and try to make a life for themselves together ― a very twee life. Then the adults start looking for them ― in a very twee way. Although the Anderson aesthetic is kind of out right now during this more hardened, ultra-cynical Donald Trump era, I still love this movie. I think you’ll find much to enjoy whether you’re revisiting it or watching for the first time. You can watch the trailer below. And if you want to stay up to date with what to watch on a weekly basis, subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.    “The Queen” stars Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II. She won an Academy Award for the role. The movie has an impressive 97 percent on Rotten Tomatoes.

ARTS & CULTURE," For those of you who have been in the throws of the college audition process, things are finally beginning to wind down. You may now be twiddling your thumbs, having completed the whirlwind of applications, travel and a series of high stakes auditions. A few years back, one of my students looked at me after her final college audition and tearily confessed, ""I have worked so hard, and now it's all over!"" Kind of an empty ""What do I do now?"" feeling. You are, no doubt, anxious to know your results as you reflect on the audition experience and wait for a thick letter to arrive in your mailbox. Psychologist and performing arts advisor, Bill Crawford, offers this reminder, ""It isn't about just being chosen. It's about finding a place where you can be yourself and learn, and grow, and thrive for the next four years."" If all this leaves you feeling uncertain about your future, you may be in need of some ""actor nourishment"" right about now. So I have compiled a short list of reading material I hope you find useful, practical and even affirming.  How To Choose A Monologue For Any Audition

POLITICS,"President Donald Trump plans to replace White House lawyer Ty Cobb with Emmet T. Flood, a lawyer who represented former President Bill Clinton during his late-1990s impeachment hearings. “For several weeks Ty Cobb has been discussing his retirement and last week he let Chief of Staff Kelly know he would retire at the end of the month,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement confirming Cobb’s departure. Flood’s decision to join the White House was confirmed by his law firm, the Washington-D.C.-based Williams & Connolly LLP. “We are disappointed to lose him to the White House, but we fully appreciate Emmet’s strong commitment to public service,” said Williams & Connolly LLP Chairman Dane Butswinkas in a statement. “The White House will be fortunate to have his experienced counsel.” Flood’s replacement of Cobb was first reported by the New York Times. Trump has reportedly been discussing the shakeup with confidantes for weeks, although the president has denied doing so. Cobb was the lead White House lawyer dealing with requests from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. “It has been an honor to serve the country in this capacity at the White House,” Cobb told the Times. “I wish everybody well moving forward.” One White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Cobb’s departure did not indicate a crisis — or at least a crisis beyond the daily one. “A normal chaos day,” the official said. Cobb has repeatedly said that Trump will eventually agree to meet with Mueller, who is investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 election, even though Trump appears to have soured on the possibility of an interview. Cobb told ABC News Wednesday that a meeting between Trump and Mueller is “certainly not off the table and people are working hard to make decisions and work towards an interview.”  His departure, however, leaves the president’s legal team without a person holding a security clearance to deal with the sensitive information in the Russia investigation and negotiations with Mueller. Jay Sekulow, the lead lawyer on Trump’s personal legal team, is still waiting for his clearance, according to Bloomberg. The White House did not return a request for comment about how long it might take Flood to receive one and whether a lack of clearances hurt the legal team’s ability to operate.  Before becoming a partner at the litigation firm Williams & Connolly LLP, which also represents Hillary Clinton, the high-profile Flood spent two years in the Bush administration’s White House Counsel’s office, representing former President George W. Bush in “executive privilege-related disputes,” according to a statement on his firm’s website. He also represented former Vice President Dick Cheney in a lawsuit brought by former CIA agent Valerie Plame. The Times reported in mid-March that Trump was considering adding Flood to the White House team, saying that his main role would be assisting with the president’s Justice Department dealings. Flood reportedly passed on an opportunity to join the White House team last summer. Trump blasted that Times story in a tweet at the time, claiming that he was “very happy” with his legal team, which then also included John Dowd before the lawyer’s subsequent resignation on March 22.  Amanda Terkel and Shirish Date contributed reporting."

BUSINESS,"No matter how talented you are or what you’ve accomplished, there are certain behaviors that instantly change the way people see you and forever cast you in a negative light. We’ve all heard of (or seen firsthand) people doing some pretty crazy things at work. Truth is, you don’t have to throw a chair through a window or quit in the middle of a presentation to cause irreparable damage to your career. There are so many things that can kill the careers of good, hard-working people. Honest mistakes often carry hard-hitting consequences. “You can’t make the same mistake twice, the second time, it’s not a mistake, it’s a choice.” - Anonymous There doesn’t have to be a single, sickening moment when you realize that you just shoved your foot firmly in your mouth, either. Little things can add up over time and undermine your career just as much as (or more than) one huge lapse in judgment. Self-awareness is a critical skill in the workplace. It’s the foundation of emotional intelligence, a skill set that TalentSmart research shows is responsible for 58 percent of your job performance. If you remain self-aware, these mistakes are all things that you can control before they creep up on you and damage your career. 1. Over-promising and under-delivering. It’s tempting to promise the moon to your colleagues and your clients, especially when you’re honest and hardworking and believe that you can do it. The problem is that there’s no point in creating additional pressure that can make you look bad. If you promise to do something ridiculously fast and you miss the deadline by a little bit, you’ll likely think that you did a good job because you still delivered quickly. But the moment you promise something to someone, they expect nothing less. You end up looking terrible when you fall short, which is a shame, because you could have done the same quality work in the same amount of time with great results if you’d just set up realistic expectations from the beginning. This is one of those situations where perception matters more than reality. Don’t deliberately undershoot your goals; just be realistic about the results you can deliver so that you’re certain to create expectations that you will blow out of the water. 2. Having an emotional hijacking. My company provides 360° feedback and executive coaching, and we come across far too many instances of people throwing things, screaming, making people cry, and other telltale signs of an emotional hijacking. An emotional hijacking demonstrates low emotional intelligence, and it’s an easy way to get fired. As soon as you show that level of instability, people will question whether or not you’re trustworthy and capable of keeping it together when it counts. Exploding at anyone, regardless of how much they might “deserve it,” turns a huge amount of negative attention your way. You’ll be labeled as unstable, unapproachable, and intimidating. Controlling your emotions keeps you in the driver’s seat (something you can develop through emotional intelligence training). When you are able to control your emotions around someone who wrongs you, they end up looking bad instead of you. 3. Sucking up to your boss. Some people suck up to their boss and call it managing up, but that isn’t the case at all. Sucking up has nothing to do with a real relationship built on respect; it is sneaky and underhanded. Suck-ups try to get ahead by stroking the boss’s ego instead of earning his or her favor. That doesn’t go over well with colleagues who are trying to make it on merit. Yes, you want to bolster your relationship with your boss, but not by undermining your colleagues. That’s the key distinction here. For a boss-employee relationship to work, it has to be based on authenticity. There’s no substitute for merit. 4. Eating smelly food. Unless you happen to work on a ship, your colleagues are going to mind if you make the entire place smell like day-old fish. The general rule of thumb when it comes to food at work is, anything with an odor that might waft beyond the kitchen door should be left at home. It might seem like a minor thing, but smelly food is inconsiderate and distracting—and so easily avoidable. When something that creates discomfort for other people is so easily avoided, it tends to build resentment quickly. Your pungent lunch tells everyone that you just don’t care about them, even when you do. 5. Backstabbing. The name says it all. Stabbing your colleagues in the back, intentionally or otherwise, is a huge source of strife in the workplace. One of the most frequent forms of backstabbing is going over someone’s head to solve a problem. People typically do this in an attempt to avoid conflict, but they end up creating even more conflict as soon as the victim feels the blade. Anytime you make someone look bad in the eyes of their colleagues, it feels like a stab in the back, regardless of your intentions. 6. Negativity. Sometimes when you’re feeling negative and down, your mood can leak out and affect other people, even if you don’t intend it to. You were hired to make your boss’s and your team’s jobs easier, not harder. People who spread negativity through their department and complain about the work or other people complicate things for everyone else. If people always have to tiptoe around you so as not to dislodge that massive chip on your shoulder, they are unlikely to be willing to do it for very long. 7. Gossiping. People make themselves look terrible when they get carried away with gossiping about other people. Wallowing in talk of other people’s misdeeds or misfortunes may end up hurting their feelings if the gossip finds its way to them, but gossiping will make you look negative and spiteful every time, guaranteed. 8. Bragging. When someone hits a home run and starts gloating as they run the bases, it’s safe to assume that they haven’t hit very many home runs. On the other hand, if they hit a home run and simply run the bases, it conveys a business-as-usual mentality, which is far more intimidating to the other team. Accomplishing great things without bragging about them demonstrates the same strong mentality—it shows people that succeeding isn’t unusual to you. 9. Announcing that you hate your job. The last thing anyone wants to hear at work is someone complaining about how much they hate their job. Doing so labels you as a negative person and brings down the morale of the group. Bosses are quick to catch on to naysayers who drag down morale, and they know that there are always enthusiastic replacements waiting just around the corner. Bringing It All Together These behaviors may sound extreme and highly inconsiderate, but they have a tendency to sneak up on you. A gentle reminder is a great way to avoid them completely. What other behaviors should I add to this list? Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me. Want to learn more from me?

ARTS & CULTURE," It's hard to discuss the genre often referred to as ""outsider art"" without calling into question the term itself. Referencing art made not only on the periphery of the artistic institution, but on the outskirts of society and culture in the widest sense, the category generates a boundary in its very utterance, erecting a spoken wall between what's in and what's out. A recently closed group exhibition at David Zwirner Gallery in New York City, titled ""System and Vision,"" featured artists ""whose unique ideas developed outside the circuit of art world institutions,"" in the words of the gallery.  The show featured the work of 11 artists and one anonymous collective, some creating erotic drawings, others rigidly formulaic photographs; some lifelike dolls, others convoluted calendars. What ties the exhibition and its wide range of artists together, is their mutual distance from market trends and art historical traditions -- including any awareness or expectation of being a publicly viewed artist whatsoever.
 Chris Hipkiss, Forget The Sun, 2012, Mixed media on paper, 57 1/2 x 36 1/4 inches (146 x 92 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Despite the fact that the artists on view might never have anticipated they'd be shown at a gallery, here they were, suddenly featured at one of the biggest and most powerful contemporary art spaces in the world. As ArtReview put it, the haven is ""the closest a commercial gallery can come to being a museum."" Last year David Zwirner himself came in at No. 2 in the publication's yearly roundup of the art world's ""Power 100,"" ranking above fellow art dealer Larry Gagosian, MoMA director Glenn Lowry and Jeff Koons, among many, many others. All of which is to say, the gallery is most definitely not an ""outsider"" gallery. So where does that put ""System and Vision,"" a medley of artists suddenly placed on the same walls as art world giants like Yayoi Kusama, Richard Serra and Dan Flavin? Let's take a closer look at the substance of the show, which was organized -- into four thematic categories: eroticism, pseudo-science, science fiction and the occult -- in collaboration with Delmes & Zander, a gallery based in Germany that focuses on ""conceptual outsider art.""
 William Crawford, Untitled, 1990s, Pencil on paper, 11 x 8 1/2 inches (28 x 21.5 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Sex is a common subject for many artists, but the erotic terrain navigated by visionaries operates somewhat differently. This particular breed of ""raw erotica"" is a mode of intense desire that is rarely translated into physical copulation -- whether due to geographical isolation, physical or developmental disability. Such carnal impulses reach their fruition in the act of art-making itself, yielding visuals that stray from the depictions of sex we widely encounter in art, film, porn and real life. Some are naive, others aggressive or just plain bizarre, depending on the artist's exposure to sex in the flesh as opposed to on the page. One such erotically inclined artist is William Crawford, a man whose name is only known by his signature, sprawled on some of the hundreds of orgiastic drawings discovered in an abandoned house in Oakland, California. Many of the works were created on the backs of prison rosters in the 1990s, leading to the theory that Crawford created them behind bars, yearning for sexual activity. The frequent appearance of a man with an afro and mustache, thought to be Crawford himself, provides a potential visual reference for the artist. The pencil on paper drawings depict leather-clad bombshells, group sexual encounters, rape scenes and other taboo reveries, in a style that shifts from exaggerated and cartoonish to startlingly precise. Amersand Gallery describes Crawford's artistic style as ""more a dream than documentation, more fantasy than perversion: the mise en scène of a sexual reverie in which Crawford is king.""
 Morton Bartlett, Untitled, ca. 1950, Vintage gelatin silver print, 4 x 5 1/8 inches (10 x 13 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  An even stranger take on the erotic theme manifests itself in the work of Morton Bartlett, a graphic designer who, at the age of 27, furtively began crafting incredibly lifelike dolls of boys and girls ranging in age from eight to sixteen. Between 1936 and 1960 Bartlett created 15 dolls in secret, meticulously carving and painting their bodies as well as creating their ensembles from scratch.  The dolls look as sinister as the unusual hobby sounds. ""They project childish innocence,"" Ken Johnson wrote for the Boston Globe, ""but in Bartlett's hands innocence becomes a kind of tease. Note the glimpses of underwear and lacy petticoats in many of the photographs. Looking at these dolls is like seeing through the eyes of a pedophile.""  Although there's some level of desire pulsing through Bartlett's dolls, there is nothing explicitly aligning them with sex. In ""How to Look at Outsider Art,"" Lyle Rexer aligns the artist's mission with that of Edgar Degas, bringing his bronze ballerinas to life. For Rexer, Bartlett's standout feat is using the power of the camera to bring the lifeless dolls a sense of uncanny vitality. ""They take their place almost seamlessly among the vast archive of the once-but-no-longer-alive captured in photographs, and in death they gain a convincing vitality they do not have as objects.""
 Type 42 (Anonymous), Star Trek, 1960s-1970s, Mixed media on Polaroid, 3 1/4 x 4 1/4 inches (8.3 x 10.8 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Also exploring the mystifying abilities of photography is the found collection of 950 Polaroids referred to as Type 42, capturing the expressions of television, B-movie and sci-fi actresses. The dizzying black-and-white photos, taken between 1969 and 1972, capture starlet's faces like floating heads against a black backdrop, pixelated, buckled and sparkling. Details are scribbled on the borders of the images, fastidiously recording each actress' name, television program or movie title, and sometimes measurements.  ""The survey of the archive shows that the photographer went to great lengths to capture specific poses and moments within these televised shows and movies. The viewer can only guess the number of 'takes' that must have cycled through to get each final shot."" David Zwirner Gallery notes the level of obsession not only applied to the actresses themselves, but to the archiving system of the project itself. An artist known as Prophet Royal Robertson, who was born in 1936 and later developed paranoid schizophrenia, bridges the categories of erotica and sci-fi with his violent and apocalyptic cardboard depictions. His piece ""THE DAY THE WORLD END"" (many of his drawings are titled in all-caps) seems to stem from his first vision at 14 years old, of a space ship with God as a driver. Memories of his ex-wife’s unfaithfulness later started to fuse with his with schizophrenic hallucinations, until the impending threat of global female conspiracy seemed inevitable. His works combine futuristic prophecies with violent, misogynist fantasies, all pointing back to his own sense of powerlessness.
 Prophet Royal Robertson, THE DAY THE WORLD END, 1990s, Ink, marker, and enamel on cardboard, 28 x 22 1/8 inches (71 x 56 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Often, the term ""outsider art"" tells more about the artist -- and his or her life story, mental or emotional aptitude -- than the art. It's a genre normally dictated by a certain kind of story more than a singular style. However, David Zwirner Gallery's statement never once uses the term ""outsider art."" Possibly, in part, because after showing at Zwirner, they're not quite outsiders anymore. As the show's title conveys, the artists of ""System and Vision"" overlap with their individualized, yet mutually obsessive practices, as well as their imaginative visions, each molding an entire world inside the mind. Rather than highlighting the stories of the artists on view, the organizers emphasize the primary inklings of a thematic foundation, a potential method that could unite an anonymous batch of fame-crazy Polaroids from the '60s with a bizarre trove of erotic pencil drawings from the '90s. The emphasis shifts from the story to the style.  It would be incorrect to say that because these artists showed at Zwirner they are now a part of the same league as the gallery's world famous darlings. That's, in part, why 11 of them showed at once. However, for many of the exhibited artists, some of whom remain anonymous or nearly entirely cloaked in mystery, it's a radical step toward the mainstream, perhaps an unthinkable one.  As the phrase ""outsider art"" creates a discriminatory boundary, divesting untrained artists from their rightful places in the artistic spotlight, ""System and Vision"" could be a step forward. As could the language of its press release, which refuses to use the term ""outsider art"" nor another alternative. It's unusual to see a name like William Crawford alongside Alice Neel, even if its sandwiched among 10 other names. Hopefully one day it won't be.

POLITICS,"After being denied entry to the U.S. for more than 24 hours, eight migrants from the caravan that made its way through Mexico in recent weeks were granted permission to cross the border late Monday to claim asylum. The rest of the approximately 150 migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador continue waiting at the border to claim asylum in the U.S., said Pueblo Sin Fronteras, the group that organized the caravan. But the entry of even a few members of the group into the U.S. is a triumph nonetheless, according to a Facebook post.  The caravan group has been camping out since Sunday near the San Ysidro port of entry between San Diego and Tijuana. Customs and Border Protection officials blocked the migrants’ entry into the U.S., claiming they first needed to process those already waiting at the U.S. crossing facility, which is filled to capacity. The #RefugeeCaravan celebrates that the 8 asylum seekers entered the US to be processed by CBP officers. @amnestyusa @Carecen_LA @WomenBelong @CosechaMovement @CIYJA @NDLON @latinorebels @AlOtroLado_Org @PuebloSF pic.twitter.com/z0sFi7ZNta The caravan’s arrival at the border is the culmination of a weeks-long odyssey for a group that at one point consisted of about 1,200 people, including children, who travel together as protection from kidnappers, muggers and rapists who prey on the immigration route. They gathered almost one month ago in southern Mexico, moving northward. Some dropped off along the way, but hundreds made it to Tijuana on Wednesday, announcing they planned to enter San Diego over the weekend. President Donald Trump first drew attention to the caravan several weeks ago, when he slammed the migrants as a national security threat and deployed the National Guard to protect the border. He reignited the conversation Monday in a tweet, assailing U.S. immigration law: The migrant ‘caravan’ that is openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective U.S. immigration laws are. Yet Democrats like Jon Tester continue to support the open borders agenda – Tester even voted to protect Sanctuary Cities. We need lawmakers who will put America First. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen warned that anyone entering the U.S. illegally would be prosecuted. Claiming asylum out of fear of persecution in another country, however, is entirely legal. These caravans have been operating for a decade without much attention to help those escaping violence find safe haven in the U.S. or Mexico.  Still, the Department of Justice on Monday filed criminal charges against 11 suspected members of the caravan, alleging they illegally entered the U.S. Meanwhile, the other migrants continue waiting, sleeping outdoors. “On one hand, I’m very happy that it’s finally beginning, that perhaps they will start to accept us little by little,” Orfa Marín, a Honduran immigrant who has been traveling with her three children and her partner, told The New York Times on Monday. “But on the other hand, we have to wait here until it’s our turn. It could be days.”"
POLITICS,"President Donald Trump has made a tweak to his diet.  Rudy Giuliani told the Washington Post that when the two met for lunch recently, Trump ate a burger, but with only half a bun as a means of making it healthier. Trump didn’t change what was inside the half-bun: The burger was still cooked well-done, as he likes it.  The former New York City mayor, who is now part of Trump’s legal team, told the newspaper he sometimes goes with half a bun on burgers himself.  “It’s a good way to do it,” Giuliani, who ate a Cobb salad at the Trump meeting, said.  In January, White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson told the president to eat better and lose about 10 to 15 pounds. However, Jackson also pronounced Trump to be in “excellent” health despite his well-known love of fast food.  “You know, I told the president that if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years, he might live to be 200 years old,” Jackson said at the time, per The Hill. Trump’s burger tweak included more bun than in the past. Last year, former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said Trump’s typical McDonald’s order while on the campaign trail was two Big Macs, two Filet-o-Fish and a chocolate milkshake. But at that point, the future president wasn’t eating the buns at all.  “Well, he never ate the bread, which is the important part,” Lewandowski said on CNN. “He was busy campaigning. We didn’t have time to sit down for a meal.” A post shared by President Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on May 26, 2016 at 2:29pm PDT The New York Times also reported that Trump would rip the buns off burgers while campaigning.  “Do you know how many calories you save that way?” Trump told the Boston Herald’s Howie Carr.  Trump cuts the carbs when he’s eating pizza, as well.  “I scrape the toppings off my pizza,” he told US Weekly in 2015. “I never eat the dough.” Once in the White House, his eating habits seemed to change. Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) recounted a lunch with the president earlier this year during a podcast interview with The New York Times. “I am trying to lose a little weight. So I have for lunch usually a cheeseburger with no bun,” Schumer said in January. “And [Trump] had a cheeseburger with a bun and a whole lot of french fries.”"
POLITICS,"SHREWSBURY, W.Va. ― Don Blankenship had been out of prison for only seven months when Tommy Davis started seeing his face and hearing his voice everywhere. Blankenship launched his bid to become West Virginia’s next Republican senator late last year and started buying advertisements on local TV stations. They all began with a line that nauseated Davis: “I’m Don Blankenship, candidate for U.S. Senate, and I approve this message.”  Davis stopped watching the local news to avoid the ads, retreating to the reliably Blankenship-free zones of hunting shows and Netflix. But then Blankenship’s voice was there in Davis’ pickup truck, via Pandora radio advertising. Davis had to limit his use of that, too, lest driving around town become its own form of torment.  “It seems no matter where I go or what I do, it’s Don Blankenship,” Davis, 50, said recently, driving along the Kanawha River in his Toyota Tacoma. Blankenship is the former Massey Energy chief executive who presided over the Upper Big Branch mining disaster, in Montcoal, West Virginia, in 2010. Davis was a miner at Upper Big Branch with his eldest son, Cory Davis; his only brother, Timmy Davis; and a nephew, Joshua Napper. Davis was making his way out of the mine during a shift change when the explosion happened. He bolted to the exit, wind and rocks tumbling around him, and made it out alive.  Twenty-nine men did not, including his three loved ones. The bodies of his son, brother and nephew were recovered together days after the blast, once it was safe to do so. Cory was the youngest of the dead at 20 years old. Various investigations faulted Massey officials for systematically cutting corners on safety and putting profits before their workers’ lives. They found that Massey, under Blankenship’s helm, had fostered a culture of fear and intimidation inside the mine and hidden safety lapses from regulators. Blankenship served one year in prison on a misdemeanor conviction for conspiring to violate mine safety laws. He has continued to deny responsibility for the worst mining catastrophe in four decades.  The particular void left by Cory Boy, as Davis still refers to his son ― “my hunting partner, my fishing partner, my all-around go-to buddy” ― has made the Blankenship redemption tour an unbearable spectacle for Davis, just as it has for other Upper Big Branch families. “I actually thought he would stay the hell out of West Virginia,” Davis said of Blankenship. “He just won’t leave it alone.” “He’s trying to put it back in our face. I call it harassment,” he continued. “That’s what it is: It’s straight-up harassment.” Blankenship has spent $2 million of his own money on the campaign and has savaged his main Republican primary opponents, Congressman Evan Jenkins and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, in hopes of facing off in a general election against incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin (D), whom he personally blames for his prison sentence. Blankenship’s campaign did not respond to several interview requests for this story. Although Blankenship has slipped behind Jenkins and Morrisey in recent polls, buried in attack ads the GOP establishment is funding to keep him off the ticket, his candidacy is not a joke. For all his infamy, plenty of voters still associate him with good-paying blue-collar jobs in hollows without a whole lot of them. As Davis put it, “There are still people around here who worship the ground he walks on.” The prospect of Sen. Don Blankenship, however unlikely, has polluted even the most solemn customs for Davis.  On April 5, he and other Upper Big Branch families made the drive up to the mine to observe the eighth anniversary of the disaster. Davis carries out the same ritual each year. He picks up 29 balloons ― 26 black and three orange, the latter signifying his family members ― then heads to Cory’s grave with his ex-wife, Cindy; their two sons, Seth and Nathan; and their grandson, Cory Tripp. There they release the balloons and talk. Then it’s on to the mine site, where each of the dead has a cross. Davis hangs a wreath for all the miners and lays out three white roses for his family members. He ties a white bandana to Cory’s cross. He looks up to the spot on the mountain where he and the other miners would punch out at the end of their shifts. Then they drive down Coal River Road to the 48-foot granite memorial that was erected in 2012, showing 29 miners’ silhouettes.  It was at the memorial where things got unpleasant at this year’s anniversary gathering. Among the families, politicians and news crews was Gwen Thomas, the sister of Grover Skeens, one of the miners who was killed. Thomas has taken an unusual position among Upper Big Branch family members: She has called the disaster an act of God and praised Blankenship, who in turn has featured Thomas in a television ad and on the campaign trail.  The presence of an outspoken Blankenship supporter at the memorial was too much for Davis and other mourners. She defended the former CEO; they gave her a piece of their minds. A state trooper intervened. Davis has tried to curb his Facebook time during the Senate race. The night before the anniversary, he visited Blankenship’s campaign page, where the candidate posts videos and says he’ll bring jobs back to West Virginia. Davis uploaded a photo of Cory’s gravesite onto Blankenship’s page. “Here look at my Cory boy 20 years young,” Davis wrote. “Tell him why you chose production over safety.”  The next time Davis visited the page, his post was gone.   *** On a recent Friday morning, Davis steered his ATV up a gravel road to a former strip-mining site, the back of his vehicle loaded with turkey decoys, spare camo clothes and a 12-gauge shotgun. What had once been a mountaintop now felt more like prairie, with long, flat stretches of grass and brush lying between hills. Davis used to work on sites like this one as a surface miner as they were stripped. Now he comes here to run his dogs, call for turkeys, or climb a treestand and wait for a buck. The time in the woods is bittersweet. It was his brother, Timmy, who taught him how to hunt, and Davis passed everything he knew on to Cory, who shot his first whitetail when he was 9. Now he mostly hunts alone, but he appreciates the quiet of the woods more than ever. Besides, any time spent in a treestand is time spent not drinking.  “If I sit at home and dwell on things,” he said with a turkey call in his mouth, “it’ll just fuck me up.” A few months after the disaster, Davis went back to work at a mine run by Alpha Natural Resources, the coal giant that would go on to acquire Massey. He still had a ringing in his ears from the blast and what would turn out to be post-traumatic stress disorder. He struggled with loud sounds. He had panic attacks. “I just couldn’t sleep,” he said. “I couldn’t think. I couldn’t function. I was getting lost. I was having problems.” He accepted a settlement for his son’s death and stopped working. Some families used their money to leave the state and start new lives. Davis stayed in West Virginia but as a slightly different person. He covered his body in tattoos, including 29 crosses along his back and the words “Cory Boy” across his shoulders. He customized a Harley as a rolling memorial to Upper Big Branch.  A couple of years ago, he sold the house where Cory grew up because the memories were too painful. He bought a small ranch house at the end of a street of trailers that backs up on the Kanawha, far enough from the highway that all he hears at night is the river. He started an annual scholarship at Cory’s high school in his name. The unofficial mission is to give kids better options than hoping for a coal resurgence. The lack of good-paying work is why people cling to someone like Blankenship, Davis said.  “Just look around you. There ain’t a hellacious lot to do here if you didn’t go to college,” he said. “The guys who support [Blankenship] ― they don’t have other options as far as jobs go.” Moving on has not been easy. He ends up at Cory’s grave every other night or so, drinking a beer and turning one upside down for his son. Cory’s friends are at the stage where they’ve started families, and Davis finds himself wondering if Cory would have had a son, too: “Would he have been tall or short, fat or skinny, would he have looked more like him or more like her, and other questions we’ll never know the answer to.”  Blankenship’s visibility and lack of contrition have made it all the harder. He has maintained, contrary to official investigations, that the root cause of the blast at Upper Big Branch was a sudden influx of natural gas in the mine, rather than an excessive amount of coal dust, which is highly explosive. The distinction is crucial. Coal operators have an obligation to keep coal dust levels in check, through sufficient ventilation and rock-dusting, a process that neutralizes coal dust with pulverized limestone.  What happened at Upper Big Branch was investigated by federal regulators, state regulators, the United Mine Workers of America union, and an independent panel established by Manchin, who was West Virginia’s governor at the time. To varying degrees, they all faulted Massey for poor ventilation and inadequate rock-dusting practices in the mine.  The explosion likely started when the shearer on a mining machine ignited a methane fireball, thanks in part to poorly maintained equipment. But it would have been the high levels of coal dust that sent it ripping through more than 2 miles of the mine shaft, so that even men far from the blast couldn’t escape. (The UMWA went so far as to title its report “Industrial Homicide.”) Davis remembers the dust being so thick that day he could see it. Other miners recalled the air belowground flowing in odd directions before the explosion. Blankenship’s natural gas theory conveniently absolves him of the chronic failures investigators found.   “It’s just not substantiated,” said Celeste Monforton, a safety expert who was part of the independent panel, which also faulted federal and state regulators for not adequately policing Massey. “It was a coal dust explosion. The fingerprint mapping that was done to find a cause ― all of that evidence indicated that,” she said. “All of the analytical work that was done, taking all the dust samples, an extraordinary amount of evidence showed that.” Blankenship has also claimed that the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration forced Massey to change its ventilation plans before the explosion, suggesting MSHA may be to blame for the disaster. The independent panel found no evidence of that. However, it did find regulators failed at Upper Big Branch ― by not cracking down hard enough on Massey. As Blankenship has blamed natural gas and MSHA for the disaster while on the campaign trail, Robert Atkins has been there to fact-check him. Atkins lost his son Jason at Upper Big Branch. He has made a point of showing up at Blankenship’s town hall meetings to speak directly to undecided voters and rebut Blankenship’s telling of events. He estimates he’s gone to five campaign events and has spoken one-on-one with 50 voters, urging them to vote for anyone but Blankenship. His wife joined him for the first event, but couldn’t do any more.  “She just couldn’t take it,” Atkins said. “I’ve got in my head, and I feel I’m right, that that man killed my son. And when he killed my son, it took the life out of me, out of his mom, and out of his brother. ... The man has no remorse.”  According to the independent panel, the deeper cause of the disaster was what they called “the Massey Way.” Under Massey’s corporate culture, miners were to run coal at all costs. The mine continued operating even when airflow was dangerously low. Workers lacked basic safety equipment while having to file regular production reports. Methane detectors were disabled to avoid having to shut down the mine if levels got too high. And workers were instructed to tip off colleagues belowground when federal safety inspectors showed up. Massey enforced this system through intimidation, investigators found. Workers testified after the explosion that they did what they were told because they feared for their jobs. Managers belittled miners who couldn’t get with the program. The company had a slogan: “S1 P2,” for safety first and production second. According to Davis, the joke among miners was that it was really “P1 S2.”  As his ATV lurched up and down the ravines, Davis tried to explain the grip Blankenship had on his mines. He had worked at other Massey properties before Upper Big Branch. He remembers eating lunch out of his pocket as he worked, reluctant to slow production with a proper break. He didn’t speak up about hazards, either, fearful of losing the job that he desperately needed. He recalled the pressure workers felt whenever Blankenship showed up in his car or helicopter. Someone would shout to him as he cut coal with the highwall miner machine: “Tommy, whatever it is you’re cutting, keep it rolling. Do not stop. Do. Not. Stop.”  “That money was feeding their kids and paying for their trucks. They were proud of that and didn’t want to lose that,” Davis said. “Don Blankenship scared those people to death.”  *** Three Upper Big Branch managers went to prison before Blankenship, all found to have deceived regulators or investigators in covering up safety problems. Blankenship was charged with three counts: securities fraud, making false statements to officials, and conspiring to violate mine safety regulations. A jury found him guilty only of the latter charge.  Davis attended every day of the two-month trial that he could, making a point to sit near Blankenship’s supporters. He wore the same outfit each day so Blankenship could better recognize him: a plaid shirt with a green jacket and an Under Armour hat. The one-year sentence handed down ― the maximum the judge could impose under the misdemeanor conviction ― infuriated Davis, considering Blankenship had been facing up to 30 years under the original charges. (The conspiracy charge was not directly linked to the disaster itself.) Outside the courthouse, a television reporter asked Davis why he was so frustrated. His raw and eloquent response, delivered with a quaking voice, would be viewed over a million times online: “If you was where I was that day, and you seen my son after laying in there for five days, and seen what he looked like ― if you worked on them men like we did when they come outside, if you smelled them, and you looked at them, then you’d know where I come from.”  The 12-month sentence didn’t make Blankenship any more penitent. He declared himself a political prisoner. He published a 67-page booklet from his low-security prison in California, proclaiming his innocence and propagating conspiracy theories about a government cover-up. He promoted a 2014 “documentary” he’d funded, called “Upper Big Branch ― Never Again,” faulting the feds for the disaster. He blamed Manchin personally for his prosecution, taking his feud to Twitter.  As West Virginia’s governor, Manchin was at Upper Big Branch in the days following the explosion. He and Davis have since become friends. Davis said he often gets a call from a number he keeps in his cell as “Senator Joe,” and it’s Manchin asking how he’s doing. They talk about motorcycles, Blankenship and whatever else Davis has on his mind. (Manchin’s uncle died in the Farmington Mine Disaster, along with 77 others, in 1968.) Davis said Manchin’s campaign has never asked anything of him, though he would happily oblige if it did, particularly if Blankenship wins the Republican nomination on May 8. “He’s the only politician who’s been there the whole time,” Davis said of Manchin. “He won’t say it, but I will.” On a Thursday in mid-April, Davis learned that Blankenship would be attending a meet-the-candidates forum that night in Chelyan, just across the river from Davis’ home. He was surprised the Senate hopeful would have the nerve to show up to a public event so close to Upper Big Branch, an area where Blankenship campaign signs appear to be sparse. Davis had told himself that he wouldn’t attend town hall-style events, knowing he might lose control in an encounter with Blankenship. He decided to bend his rule. He removed the gun from his truck and told his buddy Gary Price to meet him down at the community center, where Blankenship would be. When Davis got there, a handful of police officers who already knew him came outside to greet him. They told Davis he could say whatever he wanted to Blankenship, so long as he kept some distance and didn’t threaten him.  Davis took a sign from his truck and laid it across his windshield. It said: “Cory Davis 5/22/89 - 4/5/10. Don Blankenship murdered him over coal and money.” Price parked his truck in front of the building’s main exit, dragging a custom trailer that has a dedication to Cory on one side and the names of every miner killed at Upper Big Branch on the other. Davis waited outside to confront the candidate as he left the event. He saw Blankenship walk to the glass doors and stop, the memorial display laid out in front of him. Then he watched Blankenship turn and head toward another exit, accompanied by what appeared to be an aide. They hopped in a car and left, before any words could be exchanged with Davis. Another Republican candidate, Jack Newbrough, came out the doors to take a break. “I’m sorry for your loss, Tommy,” he said, shaking Davis’ hand. “I sure would love to have your support.” Davis let the invitation hang in the air. He thanked his friend Price for coming out, then headed to his truck and off to the bar to have a beer. Although there was no confrontation, he considered his trip to the forum a success. He felt he’d shamed Blankenship for coming into his end of the valley. He noted that Blankenship never looked him in the eye. He believes the man feels guilt, despite everything he’s said to the contrary. “That boy of mine, he can’t speak out no more, so I speak out for him,” Davis said. “That’s why I do it ― to make sure Blankenship doesn’t forget it. Just like I’m sitting here thinking about him, now he’s driving home thinking about Cory and those men.” "
BUSINESS,"(Reuters) - Equifax Inc <EFX.N>, a provider of consumer credit scores, said on Thursday a hack exposed the personal details of potentially 143 million U.S. consumers between mid-May and July. The company’s shares were down 5.4 percent in after-market trading The company said criminals had accessed details including names, social security numbers, and, in some cases, driver’s license numbers. In addition, credit card numbers of around 209,000 U.S. consumers and certain dispute documents with personal identifying information of around 182,000 U.S. consumers were accessed, the company said. Equifax also said personal information of certain UK and Canadian residents were also hacked. The Atlanta-based company said it would work with UK and Canadian regulators to determine the next steps. Equifax, which discovered the unauthorized access on July 29, said it had hired a cybersecurity firm to investigate the breach. The company said there was no evidence of a breach into its core consumer or commercial credit reporting databases. The breach could be one of the biggest in the United States. Last December, Yahoo Inc said more than 1 billion user accounts was compromised in August 2013, while in 2014 e-commerce company EBay Inc <EBAY.O> had urged 145 million users to change their passwords following a cyber attack. http://reut.rs/2wMNxrT   (Reporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)"
ENTERTAINMENT,"There are iconic roles and then there’s Lois Lane, the intrepid reporter and paramour of Superman who’s made her mark on the comics world for 80 years.  Margot Kidder, perhaps the most beloved actress to inhabit the role, died in her sleep Sunday at age 69. For nearly a decade, Kidder brought Lane to the big screen in four “Superman” films opposite Christopher Reeve, who died in 2004. After news of Kidder’s death broke, some of the other actresses who’ve portrayed Lane in various works, including Teri Hatcher and Erica Durance, paid tribute to the late star on social media.  Hatcher, who starred as Lane in the ABC series “Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman” for four seasons, shared a famous photo of Kidder wearing a sweater with the Superman symbol emblazoned on the chest.  It is a privilege to have shared the same role of Lois Lane with this wonderful actress. She led the way brilliantly. My heart goes out to her family and friends. #MargotKidder #Superman pic.twitter.com/chm0H07POs “It is a privilege to have shared the same role of Lois Lane with this wonderful actress,” Hatcher wrote. “She led the way brilliantly. My heart goes out to her family and friends.” Durance was cast as Lane ahead of the fourth season of the Superman origin series “Smallville,” which aired on the WB and the CW from 2001 to 2011. Kidder, according to Durance, once told her that she “hit it out of the park” when it came to portraying the character.   “To one kick ass lady,” Durance wrote on Twitter. “You will be missed.” To one kick ass lady. You will be missed. #RIPMargotKidder Both Kidder and Hatcher also made guest appearances on “Smallville,” with the late actress dropping in for multiple episodes during the show’s fourth season. Hatcher appeared as Lois’ mother toward the end of the series’ run. Representatives for Amy Adams and Kate Bosworth, who’ve both played Lane on the big screen, did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. The official account for DC Comics, which has published the adventures of Superman since 1938, shared a message Monday afternoon about Kidder’s passing. Thank you for being the Lois Lane so many of us grew up with. RIP, Margot Kidder. pic.twitter.com/IhY73TB52P Even in her post-“Superman” years, Kidder stayed active in fan communities, regularly appearing at conventions and events. She was set to appear at Motor City Comic Con in Novi, Michigan, this coming weekend alongside some “Superman” cast mates for a panel discussion about the film’s legacy."
POLITICS,"NEW YORK ― It started innocently enough, with a flyer making the rounds at a death metal show in Amityville late last month. “The Heretic’s Crypt,” the flyer reads in gothic script. “Long Island’s most extreme brick & mortar record store in over a decade! Specializing in underground metal, and whatever else we feel like!” A death metal vinyl shop huddled in the corner of a cute antique store in Patchogue? For some of the metalheads in the area, this was a talker. The South Shore of Long Island is not exactly blast-beat country. But when two locals showed up to score some records last week, they found that the underground metal on offer included a lot of neo-Nazi records and the “whatever else” included white nationalist band T-shirts. “We start leafing through everything, and about a quarter of the way through the first box, it became really apparent that the only thing they were selling was National Socialist black metal [NSBM],” said one of the two, who asked that HuffPost withhold their names for fear of harassment. “There were scatterings of bands that weren’t associated, but the vast majority was the very sketchy Nazi-related stuff. It was disgusting.” Each offending item, they said, was instantly recognizable as belonging to fringe neo-Nazi bands or other groups not tolerated in polite metal circles. In photos of the T-shirts and records and in the owners’ social media profiles, neo-Nazi iconography abounds — wolf’s hooks, black sunwheels, the hammer and sword, “everything short of a swastika.” The pair immediately started digging online to figure out how this stuff found its way to Patchogue. They took their findings to the president of the Greater Patchogue Chamber of Commerce, James Skidmore. He was incensed, finding the pop-up and the small crew that put it together an affront not just to the metal community but to Suffolk County in general, which has some white supremacist baggage of its own. “Our community has worked way too hard over the years to come to terms with what we are and who we are and to combat racism wherever it exists,” Skidmore told HuffPost. “So to me this was a slap in the dick — excuse me for saying. I was like, are you kidding me?” Within hours of finding out on April 23, Skidmore said, he arrived at the antique shop that Heretic’s Crypt called home to find a man “packing his shit up and leaving.” They had been kicked out by the antique shop’s owner, who said he didn’t know what they were selling beyond band merchandise and records. The weird little ode to white supremacy in Patchogue had been snuffed out within a matter of days. But now Skidmore and his community faced some tough questions: Who brought this here, and why is white supremacy showing its face publicly in Long Island again? “This is my major concern: They show up, they get the conversation going with music or whatever else, and then out comes a KKK party or a white nationalist movement,” he said. With the help of friends on Facebook and the metal community at large, locals found one of the men who set up the shop: Paul Guhring, a local musician whose previous flings with neo-Nazis have landed him in heißwasser. NYC Antifa profiled him in 2016 after his label, WolfTyr Productions, brought various NSBM bands together for a show in Ronkonkoma. (For what it’s worth, the show was “a flop,” he said.) Guhring, who spoke to HuffPost on Tuesday, fell back on the usual specious excuses when asked about the neo-Nazi symbolism on display at the pop-up and on his and his compatriots’ various social media pages. “Those are all from the esoteric pagan ideologies,” he said. “They don’t necessarily have to be about Nazis. I’m not a racist. I have friends of all kinds, people that know me. In our circle of friends ― I don’t have that many friends, but ― in our circle of friends, this is disputable.” It doesn’t take a scholar in Nazi death metal to parse the T-shirts and records that Guhrig was selling. There were known NSBM bands like Hate Forest, Goatmoon, Grand Belial’s Key and Heathen Hammer, whose promotional materials look as if they ripped off the Nazi symbolism Wikipedia page: Black sunwheels, nods to Nazi phrases like “blood and soil” and other well-known neo-Nazi imagery were on full display. There was even a shirt in baby size, featuring the band M8L8TH (below right). And if there’s any doubt as to the general ideology of the fan base for M8L8TH and Grand Belial’s Key, look no further than the audiences at their live recordings on YouTube. Nazi salutes are as prominent as fists in the air.  Guhring acknowledged that some of the stuff in his collection was Nazi smut, but he denied being involved himself, at least ideologically. Sure, the people around him might be throwing up Hitler salutes, and his favorite artwork has represented Nazism for decades, and his former band Grafvolluth very publicly identified as National Socialist, and his label promoted white supremacist groups like Pennsylvania’s Wotanorden, but don’t get the wrong idea, he said. “People can take it any way they like. After all, it’s a free country,” he said. “Just because neo-Nazis hijacked certain symbols for themselves ― and they’re going to keep doing it, of course ― it does indeed have its old ancestral roots.” He lamented that he opened up shop in the first place. He and another man who helped set up Heretic’s Crypt, Buddy Zajac Mayoka, deleted their Facebook pages after the outcry last week, and now, Guhring said, his label is offline, and he has no plans for any shows or other commercial enterprises. “I really wish we didn’t do it at all, to tell you the truth ― all the anger I’ve caused people,” he said. “Basically my reputation is ruined because of this. Everything is stashed away in boxes and Hefty bags. It’s done. We can’t keep up with this.” For Skidmore, the shop scared up memories of Long Island’s history of extremism. In the 1930s, Suffolk County was home to Camp Siegfried, a pro-Nazi summer camp, adjacent to a German colony in Yaphank that named its streets after Hitler and Goebbels. After the war, some of Hitler’s relatives lived on Long Island. The Ku Klux Klan has always been active there. Long Island native Chris Cantwell, a white nationalist nicknamed “the Crying Nazi” for a video in which he teared up at the thought of being arrested for his role in the Charlottesville, Virginia, mayhem, thought the area receptive enough to his views that he considered running for New York’s 1st Congressional District. He failed to get enough signatures in his bid. Most recently, Skidmore recalled, an Ecuadorean immigrant was killed in 2008 in nearby Riverhead, where four teens admitted to being part of a gang that targeted Hispanics for hate crimes. “We’ve worked hard to get away from that. We want the message clear that hate is not welcome in Patchogue,” Skidmore said. “Even just a small pop-up. A little bit of cancer is still cancer.”"
POLITICS,"When the Federal Emergency Management Agency in March published its latest plan for mitigating natural disasters, there was one thing missing: any mention of climate change. Rep. Keith Ellison asked the agency why, and so far he’s not happy with the answer. In its latest response, FEMA says it basically forgot. “There was no decision, and no direction, to deliberately avoid or omit any particular term in the writing of the 2018-2022 Strategic Plan,” FEMA Director Brock Long wrote on April 12, referring to the document the agency uses to help anticipate and prepare the nation for natural disasters.  Long’s claim is a remarkable one given that 2017 was the costliest, most-damaging year on record for weather and climate-related disasters in the U.S., and the third-warmest year on record. Experts predict those costs, which directly impact FEMA’s operation, will increase as the climate shifts further and further from its baseline. The previous, Obama-era strategic plan identified climate change as a prime contributor to increasing disaster risk and urged action; the new, Trump-era document doesn’t mention it at all. Ellison is now asking the agency to give a real explanation. On Wednesday, he asked FEMA to explain the “analytical basis” for why it omitted climate change from its five-year plan.  “Your April 12th, 2018, response did not adequately answer this question.” Ellison wrote in a letter to Long. “Although you reassured me that ‘the plan emphasizes all aspects of disaster preparedness, regardless of cause,’ you still have not addressed why the plan makes no mention of climate change.” Where Ellison’s original letter asked FEMA to identify whom it consulted in drafting its new strategic plan, Long only cited “FEMA employees and external stakeholders,” as well as comments submitted online. Long’s responses to follow-up questions only referred back to that answer, including a request that FEMA specifically identify “any scientists or climate experts” who contributed to the decision. Ellison’s new letter requests copies of those online comments, and again asks FEMA to specifically identify those “external stakeholders.” It also asks whether Long’s office consulted with the White House when formulating the plan’s “goals and objectives.” In an emailed statement to HuffPost, FEMA public affairs director William Booher said it doesn’t matter whether climate change was mentioned in the document. “It is evident that this strategic plan fully incorporates future risks from all hazards regardless of cause,” he said. “Building upon the foundation established by FEMA’s previous two Strategic Plans, this plan commits the agency, and the nation, to taking proactive steps to increasing pre-disaster investments in preparedness and mitigation.”   Ellison has requested a response by May 14. Read his letter below:  This story has been updated with comment from FEMA."
BUSINESS,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co has agreed to pay $55 million to settle a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit accusing it of discriminating against minority borrowers by allowing mortgage brokers to charge them more for home loans, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The U.S. Justice Department complaint, filed in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, accused the bank of willfully violating the U.S. Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act between 2006 and 2009 and showing “reckless disregard” for the rights of at least 53,000 African-American and Hispanic borrowers. “We’ve agreed to settle these legacy allegations that relate to pricing set by independent brokers,” JPMorgan spokeswoman Elizabeth Seymour said. “We deny any wrongdoing and remain committed to providing equal access to credit.” A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara had no immediate comment. The alleged discrimination involved so-called wholesale loans that were made through mortgagebrokers the bank used to help originate loans, the complaint said. Chase allowed brokers to change rates charged for loans from those initially set based on objective credit-related factors, the complaint said. As a result of that discretion, minorities were charged more for home loans than white borrowers with the same credit profile, paying tens of millions of dollars in additional mortgage costs, the complaint said. An African-American taking out a $191,100 loan on average paid $1,126 more over the first five years of the loan than a white borrower. An Hispanic borrower with a $236,800 loan paid on average $968 more than a non-Hispanic white borrower, the complaint said. Chase did not require mortgage brokers to document the reasons for changing rates and failed to address racial discrimination, encouraging it to continue, the complaint said. The Justice Department has been pursuing a number of banks over alleged discrimination. From 2010 to 2014, the agency’s Civil Rights Division obtained more than $1.4 billion in relief under fair housing laws, according to an August report. In one case, Wells Fargo & Co agreed to pay $175 million to settle allegations that it charged African American and Hispanic borrowers higher rates and fees on mortgages. Cities around the country, including Miami, Baltimore and Los Angeles, also have filed lawsuits claiming that major banks targeted minorities for high-cost loans that often ended in foreclosures. The bank first disclosed Bharara’s lawsuit in a quarterly filing in 2015."
BUSINESS,"It takes an effective team to attract and serve a community in business these days. With real-time online reviews and feedback via the Internet, and instant relationships via social media, a voice from the top that is inconsistent with what is heard from the firing line defines a dysfunctional and noncompetitive company for today's customer. Thus team makeup is the critical success factor. A few companies seem to be leading the way in building and maintaining ultra-effective teams, sometimes called extreme teams. These include companies across multiple industry spectrums, notably NetFlix in entertainment, AirBnB in hospitality, and Whole Foods for groceries. I see the commonalities detailed well in the new book, ""Extreme Teams,"" by Robert Bruce Shaw. Shaw is a consultant specializing in team performance, and he brings real experience building and working with extreme teams in companies like the ones mentioned above. In my many years of experience in business, and recent work as a mentor to entrepreneurs, I have seen the business world change, and can relate well to his five success practices paraphrased here:      I recognize this is a revolution in the way most companies and employees work today, viewing work as a set of tasks with no passion, new members selected primarily on past experience and functional skills, and viewing conflict as something to be avoided or a sign of failure. They value harmony among members, and measure success as a function of the number of priorities concurrently managed. Building and managing teams along the new lines outlined is not easy, and that's why it's a real competitive advantage when you do it. It takes a new kind of management team with a strong belief that a company can thrive with a larger purpose, total customer experience is critical to success, and the new generation of workers needs a new culture of passion and relationships. As hard as it is to build extreme teams from the beginning, it's much more difficult to turn around a failing or stagnant team. In fact, many would say that it's impossible, without first replacing the top leaders and key team members in an existing organization. Thus, if you are a business leader who intends to survive and thrive in the long-term, it's time to start today by checking the culture of your teams. Your career and your company's future depend on it."
BUSINESS,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Martin Shkreli, the former drug company executive who made headlines by jacking up the price of a lifesaving drug before he was found guilty of defrauding investors, was sentenced to 7 years and a $75,000 fine on Friday. The sentence from U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, was shorter than the 15 years asked for by prosecutors but much longer than the 12 to 18 monthsShkreli’s lawyers had sought. Shkreli’s lawyer Benjamin Brafman told the judge before the sentencing that Shkreli, 34, suffered from depression and an anxiety disorder and was a “somewhat broken” person, whom the government wanted to “throw away.” Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Kasulis had said a 15 year sentence was justified in part because Shkreli’s crimes were not an “isolated lapse in judgment,” but a pattern of conduct including separate frauds for his two hedge funds and for his drug company Retrophin Inc. The Brooklyn-born entrepreneur became known as the “Pharma Bro” in September 2015 after founding Turing Pharmaceuticals, buying the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim and raising its price by 5,000 percent to $750 per pill. Shkreli was indicted for the unrelated securities fraud charges in December 2015. At the hearing, Shkreli had choked up as he said he had learned from his mistakes. “There is no conspiracy to take down Martin Shkreli. I took down Martin Shkreli with my disgraceful and shameful actions,” he said. A jury in August found Shkreli guilty of defrauding investors in two hedge funds he ran, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, by sending them fake account statements and concealing huge losses. He was also convicted of scheming to prop up the stock price of Retrophin, the drug company he founded in 2011. The $75,000 fine comes on top of $7.36 million in forfeiture Shkreli had already been ordered to pay following his conviction. Brafman, noting that he was old enough to be Shkreli’s father, said his client had not always been easy to work with. “There are times when I want to hug him and hold him and comfort him and there are times when I want to punch him in the face,” Brafman said. Kasulis said Brafman was trying to portray Shkreli as “a child.” “Mr. Shkreli is about to turn 35 years old,” she said “ He is a man who needs to take responsibility for his actions.” Shkreli has been in jail since September, when Matsumoto revoked his bail after he offered his social media followers $5,000 if they could bring him a hair from former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Actress Rose Marie, who rose to national fame in the 1960s playing wisecracking Sally Rogers on “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” died Thursday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 94. Though the actress was best known for playing Sally Rogers, her show business career goes back 90 years, starting when she was a child singer performing under the name Baby Rose Marie. Born Rose Marie Mazetta, she was known as “the child wonder.” She starred on her NBC radio show at age 5, and played opposite W.C. Fields in the 1933 film “International House,” according to Variety. It wasn’t an easy life. In her 2002 autobiography Hold The Roses, the performer described her family in harsh terms: I was raised by a mother who was a naïve, Polish lady who believed everything she was told. My father was a tyrant who had another family and never married my mother. He gambled away all the money I made as a child and my mother never knew a thing about it. He beat me because he was jealous of anybody I ever went out with. Rose Marie said mobsters like Al Capone and Bugsy Siegel helped her career as a child star. She was one of the headliners when Siegel opened the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas in 1946, but her comedic career didn’t really take off until she was cast on “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” considered one of the all-time great sitcoms, in 1961. Marie appeared in all five seasons and was nominated for Emmys in 1963, 1964 and 1966, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The experience was a highlight of her life, she said in a 2004 interview with The Hollywood Reporter: We were always changing lines, even right up to the very minute of going on the air. If something didn’t work, it didn’t work. Sometimes guest stars would panic because they weren’t used to this. We were a tight-knit, hard-working crew. I couldn’t wait to get to the set each day. Rose Marie was a popular TV guest star through the 1970s, and received public attention earlier this year with the release of “Wait For Your Laugh,” a documentary film about her nine decades in showbiz. Earlier this month, she wrote a piece for The Hollywood Reporter about her own experience with sexual harassment during Hollywood’s golden age. Rose Marie was married to trumpeter Bobby Guy from 1946 until his death in 1964. She is survived by her daughter, Georgiana Marie, and her son-in-law, Steven Rodrigues."
POLITICS,"STERLING, Va. ― Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund manager from California, wants to Make America Progressive Again. And more than any other Democratic donor, he’s putting his money where his mouth is. The billionaire has sunk over $32 million into his political nonprofit NextGen America’s efforts to turn out millennial voters in 10 battleground states this year. More controversially, Steyer has spent another $40 million on a “Need to Impeach” initiative, using television ads to drum up signatures for a petition to oust President Donald Trump. In an interview with Steyer this week, HuffPost asked him about the effectiveness of a campaign centered on the president, rather than policy issues; his views on the violence in Gaza; whether he plans to run for president; and whether his extraordinary wealth undermines his credibility as a progressive leader. Why are you trying to mobilize millennials? It’s the biggest age cohort in America and it votes at half the overall rate of American citizens. It seems to me a critical thing for the country that people who are knowledgeable and passionate and feel like the system doesn’t respond to them participate in elections. They also happen to be the most diverse generation in American history, and they’re probably the most progressive Americans. Millennial support for Democrats, according to a Reuters poll, has dropped off by 9 points since 2016. Is it possible that an effort to mobilize these voters could actually help Republicans? Well, I can tell you that our experience of going and doing more grassroots organizing for people under the age of 35 doesn’t suggest that. And I saw that poll as well, so it’ll be whatever it is. But we believe that the broadest democracy is the best democracy, and overlooked groups are not gonna have their interests and rights respected unless they participate. Your Mother’s Day ad ― in which a regretful mom warned others to “talk to your child about the GOP” ― made some waves. Was it supposed to be satirical? Of course, it was supposed to be funny. Did you laugh? Yeah, I thought it was kind of funny. But isn’t the ad a case of preaching to the choir? The people who find it funny are probably already voting for Democrats. OK, but then, I would ask you this: If you look at 2014 and 2016 and 2010, all the national elections in the last decade that have not included the words “Barack Obama,” how’s the Democratic turnout been? Is this about the base then? It’s about turnout, yes. If you look at why pollsters have blown every election for the last two years, it’s because they can’t model the electorate. They know how Daniel’s gonna vote; they just don’t know if he’s gonna vote.  There’s polling data that says your “Need to Impeach” campaign is a political loser. Won’t it just drive Republicans out to the polls? First of all, you have to start with the point that we actually have a reckless, lawless and dangerous president, that we actually think he should be impeached, that in every single one of the instances that you’re talking about, he has more influence on it than anyone else in the United States of America ― in a malign way.  So whether they like it or not, this [midterm election] is largely a referendum on this administration. What is your answer to the tactical argument against it? Because you don’t get to impeach Trump without a majority in the House. The last time impeachment was in the air in 1998, it was a midterm election for a second-term Democratic president and Democrats still ended up gaining seats in part because of public fatigue with the impeachment process. I think this is really different from 1998, and I bet you do too. There you had a president who was being impeached for a lie about a personal affair. Here we have a president who really is degrading our Constitution on a daily basis and breaking the law on important things.  So what the Democrats are saying is, “We don’t want to talk about it because we’re worried that tactically, politically, in six months, our polls tell us it won’t work well”? It’s six months from now. You have no idea. The pollsters have missed every single election [in the past two years].  We think this is a maelstrom, so we’re gonna go to our go-to move. Our go-to move is: Tell the truth and put the American people first. Anybody who thinks that they know what it’s gonna be like on Nov. 6, 2018, is kidding themselves. The world just changed today. We don’t know what’s gonna happen in the Gaza Strip. I don’t. Do you? Do I think it’s a big deal? I do actually.   Wasn’t the 2016 election already a referendum on Trump? Hillary Clinton banked on the idea that he was so repulsive, voters would reject him. Well, that’s actually an interesting point. I would say that midterm elections are overwhelmingly referendums on a sitting administration. The energy Democrats are counting on is not a positive reflection of the great program they’re putting forward, but is a reflection of people’s distaste for this president. I don’t know what you think the Women’s March was about. I sort of think it was about people who were really upset about this president. Every single one of these Indivisible groups is really a reaction to this election. I don’t think that they’re sitting here saying, “What we’re really organizing around is the Democratic platform.” Do you? I do, to be honest with you. Every single issue [Democratic voters care about goes back to Trump]. Is health care a gigantic issue in America? Absolutely. Is Trump on the wrong side of it? 100 percent. Is he on the wrong side of every issue as regards the American people? I think he is actually. One issue you seem passionate about is the Israeli government’s killing of protesters in Gaza this week. Why do you think it was a pivotal moment? Our foreign policy is changing from being a relationship-based partnership policy around the world to a military policy. Here’s a perfect example where we believe that the United States and its allies have the right to dictate what’s supposed to happen ― whether that’s our relationship with climate policy, NAFTA, Iran, China, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Does it surprise that now we’re in a proxy war in Syria and now in the Gaza Strip where we’re using force to insist that we’re right? It doesn’t surprise me. Because the implication of our foreign policy is: We will do what we want. And we will dictate outcomes to everybody else in the world. What do you mean by proxy war? When you look at what happened, we pulled out of the Iran [nuclear] treaty, and that causes an opening for missiles trading back and forth in Syria between Iran and Israel. And we moved our embassy to Jerusalem, and that caused protests in Gaza, which were put down with extreme force. And so I think that if you look at all the different instances I gave you, America is stating that we represent only ourselves and we will use our might to ensure we get our way. That’s a real change in terms of what we said we are in the world, where we’d been trying to be an example of democracy and liberty. Billions of people have a screen and they’re looking at what’s going on and they’re drawing their own conclusions about who we are. What should we do about Israel? Leverage American aid to change their behavior? People are always talking about what we should do. In most instances, in foreign economics, there’s not one thing you should do. The question is what role you’re gonna play and what are the principles under which you’re going to play it. But one of the questions we need to ask is: Are we gonna be a country that is trying to live up to its ideals? Or are we a country that insists on its way and uses military might to make sure we get it? With “Need to Impeach,” you’ve built an email list of over 5 million people. Are you going to run for president? I have no idea what I’m gonna do after Nov. 6, and there’s no way to know. The funny thing about this is, you’re asking me and people are always asking me, “What is your subtext? Because you couldn’t really think that this unfit president is unfit, that this lawless president is actually lawless.” No, the subtext is: This guy’s dangerous. There are bright candidates exciting the grassroots and they’re sometimes fighting to get a fair shake with Democratic Party leadership because they don’t have a dollar to their names. Why not back progressives in primary races? We are going to be asked to do a thousand things this year. If we do a thousand things, we are going to do zero well. We are the largest organizer of young people in the United States. We are knocking on millions of doors with the unions. We are trying to oppose this president as hard as we can with this impeachment campaign. And we are running up to three statewide [ballot initiatives] on clean energy. So it’s not like we’re doing nothing. I challenge you to find somebody who is doing as much. We have made the choice that if people are within the range of Democratic reason, we are going to give as much information to the voters and let them decide. Having said that, we understand that there is an intellectual combat going on within the Democratic Party. To use a simplistic term that I don’t really agree with, it’s kind of Hillary vs. Bernie, mods and progressives. That’s a fairly accurate framing. It ain’t really though. The real way to think about it is: Are we talking about incremental thinking or visionary thinking? And the second is about corruption. If you’re taking $385,000 for a one-hour speech to Goldman Sachs, really that didn’t change anything for you? Because I think most people in America thought, “If I got $385,000, it might change something for me.” If someone gave me $385,000 and said, “I’d like you to have a meeting,” I’d say, “OK!” People get that. There’s a big question about the fact that our system is corrupt and rigged. And that’s something that Democrats are inchoately dealing with. Like, that just feels wrong! My father was a lawyer, and one of the first things he told me about being a citizen was that “But everybody else does it, your honor,” is not a defense at law. In that divide though, however you want to frame it, where do you place yourself? Progressive. Some people might say, “This guy is fabulously wealthy. How can he ever really get the depths of economic inequality and what it’s like to struggle?” I’m sure people may think that. I do this for 100 percent of my time and try to make sure I speak to American voters as much as possible, and that’s the most fun I have. So every single week, I am out talking to people who are not fabulously wealthy. In fact, I very rarely talk to people who are fabulously wealthy. What I try to do as much as possible is go and make sure that I’m talking to activists and regular citizens, so that I, in fact, do understand. One of the real issues here is raising money and whether you have to spend all your time talking to people who are somewhere between rich and fabulously rich because they can afford to give thousands to your campaign. And you don’t have to do that. I don’t! I consider it a privilege and a luxury that I get to talk to normal people. I get to talk to normal Americans all the time and it is incredibly fun. Goldman Sachs hasn’t offered me $385,000 and I don’t know what I’d do if they ever did. But I don’t need it. I can be as honest as I can be. This interview has been edited for clarity and length."
POLITICS,"By Tim Henderson   BALTIMORE — One recent early morning, as the sun rose, a young mother knocked at the Sacred Heart Parish rectory door. In a cramped study, she told the church pastor, the Rev. Bruce Lewandowski, what had happened. Feeling ill, she had come home early from her overnight job cleaning offices and found a relative sexually abusing her handicapped daughter. She had gathered up the child and her other children and brought them to the church. “Why didn’t you call 911? You have to call 911,” the pastor told her. The woman, he recalled later, broke down. “If I tell the police, they’ll arrest me, too,” she said. As an unauthorized immigrant, she was terrified of talking to the police despite a city policy that bars officers from asking anybody about their immigration status. A year and a half of struggle between the Trump administration and immigrant-friendly states and cities has led to a stalemate: So-called sanctuary cities and states are reducing deportations, but raids aimed at stirring fears are having their intended effect, according to a new yearlong study by the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. Federal immigration officials told the authors of the report that in places where local law enforcement won’t help them deport immigrants who have landed in jail, their alternative is to look for such people on neighborhood streets. Stymied by local resistance, the Trump administration may never get deportations back to the recent high of 200,000 in 2010, under President Barack Obama. But highly publicized raids in sanctuary cities are taking a toll on immigrants’ peace of mind. “They’re sending a message. And the message is being received,” said Randy Capps, director of research for the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank based in Washington, D.C. “When we were on the street in Chicago,” he said of the sanctuary city, “we heard the same expressions of anxiety as we did in places like Houston and suburban Atlanta, the fully cooperative jurisdictions.” That fear and anxiety has caused unauthorized immigrants to retreat from public life in many cities, immigrant-friendly or not. Immigrants already are more reluctant to report crimes and to use health services and other benefits, the report concluded. In many cities, crime reports by Hispanics fell after the start of the Trump administration, especially for sexual assault and abuse cases, even as reports by non-Hispanic people rose. The Migration Policy Institute report underscores the unevenness of immigration enforcement. The U.S. Department of Justice has threatened legal action against many cities that don’t cooperate with ICE, and Texas has curbed sanctuary policies in Travis County, home to Austin. At the same time, California is facing pushback from San Diego and Orange counties as it implements a statewide sanctuary policy. Chicago and other immigrant-rich sanctuary cities, along with California, have been able to control deportations over minor crimes by refusing ICE access to local jails through so-called detainers seeking to take custody for possible deportation. In cities that are cooperating with federal immigration authorities, even a traffic arrest can expose an immigrant to deportation, especially if a court has ordered deportation or the individual has returned after a previous deportation. “About 1 in 10 unauthorized immigrants is in this situation where they’ve already exhausted their rights under the legal system,” said immigration attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg of the Legal Aid Justice Center in Falls Church, Virginia. “They’ll be deported basically as soon as ICE can arrange a flight.” Local raids can help federal authorities recover some of the potential prisoners lost to sanctuary policies, but not many, the study found. Six percent of prisoners freed because jails declined an ICE request, or “detainer,” are later arrested by ICE. That’s frustrating to the immigration officials the Migration Policy Institute interviewed for its study. “To the extent jurisdictions do not cooperate,” ICE officers told MPI, “their agency has little choice but to carry out enforcement activities in neighborhoods and other community locations, even though it is not as efficient a use of their time or resources, nor does such enforcement yield the numbers that can be identified by screening cases in local jails.” Such raids also result in the arrests of bystanders, called collateral arrests, if officers come across other unauthorized immigrants while looking for those targeted for crimes or immigration-related offenses. More than two-thirds of the 650 arrested in one major operation were collateral arrests of people who were not targeted, many simply bystanders, according to the MPI study. Such arrests can spread fear but don’t necessarily mean immediate deportation. An unauthorized immigrant without a deportation order is entitled to a court hearing. They may wait years to get one because court dockets are so full, said Sandoval-Moshenberg, who represents a dozen people arrested as bystanders during raids last year in Virginia. “They stop you and say, ‘Have you heard of so-and-so?’ You say no and then they say, ‘What about you — do you have papers?’” Sandoval-Moshenberg said. None of his clients have been deported, he said, and some won’t even face court hearings until after the 2020 election. Such raids, and the actions of enforcement-friendly states and cities, have increased arrests and deportations in the short term. Deportations overall remain low compared with the early years of the Obama administration. Arrests and deportations by ICE remain about half what they were in 2010 and 2011, when there were about 300,000 immigration arrests and 200,000 deportations a year.   Without local officials feeding arrestees to ICE through detainers and other methods of cooperation, the Trump administration does not have the manpower to get those numbers back up to Obama-era levels. California, home to a fifth of the nation’s estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants, reduced cooperation to a new low last year by banning any communication with ICE about suspects charged with minor crimes. “The great variation in how states and localities cooperate with ICE,” the study says, “means that the fortunes of an unauthorized immigrant in Texas, Tennessee, and Georgia, where the mere act of driving can result in arrest and deportation, are entirely different than in California, Chicago, and New York, where immigrants can be arrested for a variety of crimes and still not be taken into ICE custody.” If stress is unpredictable even in sanctuary cities, the same is true for strict-enforcement areas such as Prince William County, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. The county gives full cooperation to ICE and detainer requests were up 16 percent between 2016 and 2017, but they are still down by a third from 2013, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Dimas Navarro, a middle-aged heating and air-conditioning worker from El Salvador who lives in Prince William County with legal work permission, said crackdowns come and go in the immigrant community. In the past, Navarro said, hostility drove Central Americans to neighboring Maryland, where they were more welcome. But today Navarro thinks they’re starting to return to Virginia, driven by plentiful work in construction. “There’s good times and bad times. It depends on who’s in power,” Navarro said on a recent day. “They were stopping everybody checking papers for illegal immigrants. Now, no. Now everything is OK. You never know when it’s going to change, though.” Navarro said he was only stopped by police twice while driving, once for not coming to a full stop at a stop sign, but had no trouble since he has a driver’s license. The MPI report found that suburban police were more likely to use traffic enforcement to target immigrants. Gwinnett County in suburban Atlanta, for example, held as many as 184 immigrants for ICE in a month last year — most had been arrested on traffic charges. “Our clients are getting arrested for things they should not be, or that white people would not be arrested for,” said Lisa Johnson-Firth, an immigration attorney in Manassas, Virginia. Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors less immigration, defended the ICE practice of arresting people in the community during raids. “ICE’s goal in making arrests is not to sow fear but to arrest and remove deportable criminal aliens who have no right to be here,” Vaughan said, adding that they “should not be allowed to remain at large to prey on new victims.” ICE did not immediately reply to a request for comment. In Baltimore, Lewandowski said he was able to calm his parishioner and get police to investigate the sexual assault without questioning the woman’s immigration status. But not all his parishioners have been so lucky: Recently a young man, a husband and the father of small children, was pulled over by ICE after buying supplies at a lumberyard. “He said, ‘How did you know I was here?’ and they said, ‘Oh, we’ve been following you for a couple of weeks, but your family was always with you and we didn’t want to have to arrest them.’ “I guess you could say that was ICE being kind,” Lewandowski said. “But he was deported, and now his wife is alone here and she has to learn to find a job and support that family. They just created a single-mother family.”     Stateline home page Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "
ENTERTAINMENT,"Thirty-five years ago today, Michael Jackson took the stage and made an indelible impact on pop culture with his solo performance on “Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever,” a televised celebration of the famous label’s creation. The May 16, 1983 broadcast was produced and directed by Don Mischer, who has helped orchestrate other historic moments over the years, including the opening ceremony for the 1996 Olympic Games, where Muhammad Ali made a surprise appearance; Prince’s iconic 2007 “Purple Rain” Super Bowl halftime show; and many Oscar ceremonies (not, thankfully for him, 2017’s Envelopegate). Mischer spoke to Yahoo Entertainment about working with Jackson and having a front-row seat to one of the most exciting and innovative performances of all time. Since Motown 25 was intended to showcase the label’s greatest hits, Mischer and executive producer Suzanne de Passe initially banned every artist (from Marvin Gaye to the Temptations to Diana Ross) from performing new material. Jackson pushed back, wanting to perform a solo song called “Billie Jean.” Mischer recalls the tense moment: “Look, if we let Michael do a new song, who’s going to take the phone call from Marvin Gaye on Monday saying, ‘Why did you let Michael do a new song and I couldn’t do a new song?’” But that delicate game of politics was upended when Mischer witnessed Jackson’s rehearsal for his “Billie Jean” performance. “I think Linda Ronstadt was there, Smokey Robinson was there, Diana Ross was there, but the place was empty basically,” Mischer said. “So we watched ‘Billie Jean’ for the first time, the whole thing, the hat, the socks, the moonwalk — after that was over, we just knew this was incredibly special.” Mischer and de Passe ended up letting Jackson perform “Billie Jean,” with Mischer volunteering to take the call from a presumably ticked-off Marvin Gaye on Monday. For those not alive in 1983 or who may misremember the performance, Jackson’s actual moonwalk was surprisingly brief: It lasted only two and a half seconds. There are a few yelps of approval from the fans in the audience, but that moment in itself didn’t bring down the house. Like most myths, it has evolved exponentially over the years. A couple of weeks later, Mischer began to edit the concert together. Jackson visited him to decide on what shots of his performance he wanted. “He had very clear creative ideas about what he wanted and how he wanted to see himself portrayed,” said Mischer. “There were times we disagreed about a shot or something, but I always deferred to him … I trusted his judgment.” But while Jackson might have been an outsized presence onstage, he was the exact opposite in Mischer’s editing bay. “He was always quiet … he was a very quiet, shy human being,” Mischer said. “He would come into a room and just go into a corner. He would whisper to people. [But] when he got onstage, he was like a general.” Ultimately, Jackson was happy with “Motown 25.” Mischer says that after it aired, he got a signed photo saying “Thanks for the magic moment.” And the rest of the country shared in that sentiment. Mischer says that days later, he was at the White House to film a Barbara Walters interview with Nancy Reagan. As he recalls, “Coming down the elevator [of the hotel], everybody’s talking about Michael. In the taxicab going to the White House, everybody was talking about Michael. In the East Wing [of the White House] … everybody’s talking about Motown 25 and Michael.”He continued, “We do these kinds of things and we never know how people are going to react, but that morning in Washington … suddenly I said to myself, ‘This show really had an incredible impact.’” Read more from Yahoo Entertainment: This post was originally published on Yahoo Entertainment."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Jane Austen, for many today, is practically synonymous with demure romance and traditional marriage. Documents turned up by the Hampshire County Council, however, suggest she held a more irreverent attitude toward the marital institution. Austen, who never married and died at 41 in 1817, apparently created not one, but two fake marriage announcements for herself, filling out forms meant to document the publication of banns (a public proclamation of an intended marriage, read out on three successive Sundays from a church pulpit). The entries appear in the Steventon parish marriage register for 1755–1812. One entry announces an impending marriage between herself and Henry Frederick Howard Fitzwilliam of London, and the other between herself and Edmund Arthur William Mortimer of Liverpool. In a statement, Hampshire County noted, “Whether or not Fitzwilliam or Mortimer actually existed is a mystery.” It should not be overlooked, however, that Fitzwilliam and Edmund later cropped up as Christian names for two of her iconic romantic heroes, Edmund Bertram (Mansfield Park) and Fitzwilliam Darcy (Pride and Prejudice). Perhaps she had a fondness for those particular monikers.  George Austen, the novelist’s father, was the rector of the parish of Steventon, and accordingly would have been one of the officials in charge of maintaining the marriage registry for the parish. Jane likely had relatively easy access to her father’s papers, allowing her to playfully forge fictitious marriage announcements. “Jane would have been in her teens when she wrote these fake marriage entries,” commented Hampshire County Council’s Executive Member for Culture, Recreation and Countryside, Councillor Andrew Gibson in a statement, “and some could say it reveals a mischievous side during her younger years.” Given the mischief found in her spirited, witty novels, such a quality should hardly be a surprise."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Burkina Faso is a small, landlocked country in West Africa, where American photographer David Pace spends time each year. Some of the areas Pace explores during his trips are the brick quarries. In the Karaba quarries, where these photographs were made, bricks are cut using only picks and shovels.  I have been traveling to the West African country of Burkina Faso annually since 2007. Most of my time is spent in Bereba, a remote rural village without electricity or running water. I photograph all aspects of daily life in the village. But I am particularly drawn to the activity in the market, the weekly Friday night dance and the landscape and workers of the Karaba brick quarry.  Pace tells how he came to Burkina Faso in the first place: Two of my colleagues from Santa Clara University formed a non-profit organization called Friends of African Village Libraries (FAVL) in Burkina Faso in 2001. Burkina Faso has one of the world's lowest literacy rates and FAVL builds small libraries in rural villages to help address this problem. In 2007 my colleagues invited me to visit them while they were doing research in Burkina and asked me to photograph the libraries. That was my first trip to Africa and my first experience of village life. I began taking portraits of the villagers and documenting everyday activities. It was a life changing experience.   From 2009 - 2013 I was the Resident Director of Santa Clara University's study abroad program in West Africa. I spent the fall teaching digital photography to American college students. My students stayed in Ouagadougou, the country's capital, for the first weeks of instruction and then I would take them to live in remote villages without electricity or running water where they photograph, experience traditional village life and do internships in rural libraries. The students studied French & French Literature, developmental economics, environmental studies and digital photography. One of their main projects was to work with someone in their village and create two photo books which explore some aspect of village life. The students wrote texts in simple French for beginning readers. We published the books in small quantities and took them back to the libraries.    Pace's love and enthusiasm for the country and its hard-working, colorful inhabitants, is palpable in his images. The ""Friday Night"" parties he goes to look like really great shindigs!

ARTS & CULTURE,"Now that we’re all painfully familiar with the slogan “Make America Great Again,” a group artists has come together to show Trump who’s actually doing the making in this country.  We Make America is a community of artists around the country committed to using their craft to resist the exclusionary rhetoric and policy suggestions Trump has peddled. The group formed shortly after the November election, when many were left reconciling with an unexpected outcome. According to a piece reported by Barbara Pollack for Hyperallergic, artists Joyce Kozloff and Maria de Los Angeles were the first of the group to take action, reaching out to other artists in their circles. The group began meeting just four days after the election, with 16 artists in attendance. At time of publication, the movement has over 2,300 members on Facebook.  #Repost @cmsmiros ・・・ It's a strange hump day.... between MLK day and Trump's Inauguration.

ARTS & CULTURE,"A lawsuit filed on Friday accuses the renowned Washington glass artist Dale Chihuly of passing off the work of another man as his own for 15 years. The suit, filed by the lawyers of Michael Moi in King County Superior Court and the U.S. District Court for Western Washington, claims the prolific decorator of botanical gardens has been involved in a “myriad of clandestine painting sessions” with Moi, but has never compensated him or given him credit for his efforts, despite the artist’s promises otherwise. “The truth behind the creation of his paintings has been intentionally hidden,” Moi claims. In a press release sent to HuffPost, Chihuly’s camp strongly refutes Moi’s claims, dubbing the lawsuit “baseless.”  The statement, sent on Friday from Chihuly’s studio headquarters in Seattle, claims the studio hired Moi as handyman for “various cleaning, repairing and small construction projects over the years.” Moi “also alleges possession of Chihuly’s private documents, including medical papers and personal letters, that would be ‘substantively uncomfortable’ if released to the public,” the statement adds. In February, the statement continues, Moi asked for $21 million, “threatening to publicly file a lawsuit if his demand for money was not met. Earlier this month, when Chihuly had not agreed to pay him, Moi served Chihuly’s legal counsel with a state court complaint.” Chihuly Inc. asserts that it has “allowed” Moi’s claims to go public “rather than accede to Mr. Moi’s ultimatum,” characterizing the demands as “nothing more than an ugly and reprehensible display of opportunism and exploitation” motivated by a desire to disclose private information, specifically about Chihuly’s mental health, a topic of a recent Associated Press interview. Chihuly told the AP he has been dealing with bouts of depression since his 20s, and, at 75 years old, suffers from bipolar disorder. “I’m usually either up or down,” he said. “I don’t have neutral very much. When I’m up I’m usually working on several projects. A lot of times it’s about a six-month period. When I’m down, I kind of go in hibernation.” Moi’s lawsuit demands credit for joint work ― “a large volume of paintings” he says were created at Chihuly’s Boathouse in Washington, some involving blow torches and plexiglass ― as well as the revenues derived from their sale. Moi never held the position of painting assistant, the company counters, while acknowledging that Chihuly does not work alone ― he uses studio assistants to “execute his vision,” particularly his large, glass-blown sculptures that often resemble alien sea creatures or Seussian shrubbery. (A few anonymous reviewers of Chihuly Studio on Glassdoor claim to have experienced a less-than-ideal working environment.) Chihuly has been a part of court cases concerning his art before. In 2006, he sued two fellow glass-blowers, one of whom was a longtime collaborator, for copyright infringement, claiming they had purposefully mimicked his signature style. (The case against one of them, Bryan Rubino, was settled.) Chihuly’s work is currently on view in shows at the New York Botanical Garden, as well as Arkansas’ Crystal Bridges museum. It’s also included in more permanent displays in venues across the country."
ARTS & CULTURE,"It's been exactly nine years since the glorious day when Michael Govan, the newly appointed Director of Los Angeles County Museum of Art, greeted a larger than usual crowd at a press opening in March of 2006. He started with a priceless tongue in cheek remark, ""Nothing is going to rain on our parade today."" Indeed, it was raining cats and dogs, and all the guests were sitting in the courtyard, protected by a specially erected plastic tent. Everyone was staring at a formidable 90-year-old woman at the podium, who was emanating a sense of victory.  She was Maria Altmann, a long-time resident of Los Angeles, who had ultimately succeeded in a battle with the Austrian government to reclaim five great paintings by Gustav Klimt, once owned by her family, but looted by the Nazis. After World War II, these paintings ended up on permanent display at Belvedere Gallery in Vienna. The most famous of these five paintings was ""Portrait of Adele Block-Bauer,"" (1907) which is often referred to as the Lady in Gold.  At that rainy press conference, Maria Altmann spoke about her childhood memory of this famous painting, which happens to be a portrait of her Aunt.  Next to Maria sat another smiling person less than half her age, E. Randol Schoenberg, the lawyer who had helped her to win this improbable victory. If you're curious to see this historical moment, there is a video done by KCET and posted by Randol himself online.  Unfortunately for us Angelenos, Michael Govan's valiant effort to secure funds to acquire these Klimt paintings for the museum was unsuccessful. But at least the Lady in Gold was acquired by Ronald Lauder, and ended up displayed in his Neue Galerie in New York.  The newly released movie, ""Woman in Gold,"" with Helen Mirren as Maria Altmann, is an eloquent retelling of this complicated story, allowing us a glimpse into the relationship between Klimt and his glamorous subject. It follows with devastating scenes of Nazis breaking into the Block-Bauer home and a lucky last minute escape by Maria and her husband. My favorite part of the movie is of Maria Altmann's reluctant return, 50 years later, to Vienna, to fight and ultimately win this battle.  Last week, there was a chance to preview the highlights of an upcoming Sotheby's auction in New York, including paintings from the collection of Hollywood Legends Samuel Goldwyn Sr. and Jr. The preview took place at Sotheby's West Coast offices in West Hollywood, and I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of some of the paintings collected by the moguls. Their choices were much more intelligent and adventurous than what most Hollywood celebrities were known to collect at that time. I am pretty sure that smart investment was not the priority when the Goldwyns acquired all these artworks, but it definitely turned out to be a damn good investment, indeed. Many artworks are estimated to be valued at over a million dollars. Picasso's painting alone is estimated to sell for $12-18 million.  And now, we have at last the chance to see the exceptional documentary by Wim Wenders, ""The Salt of the Earth,"" about the famous Brazilian photographer Sebastião Salgado. It was screened for just a few days in December, to become eligible for an Oscar nomination, and is now back in theaters.  Be sure not to miss this documentary, which will introduce you to the beautiful and heartbreaking images captured by Salgado over decades of traveling around the world and documenting what he saw, from the gold mines of Brazil to the famine and war in Africa.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Hulu’s soon-to-be-released adaption of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 dystopian classic, The Handmaid’s Tale, has yet to premiere, but that hasn’t stopped the showrunner and producers from dreaming about future seasons. During a panel discussion that took place after a screening of the series’ first episode at Tribeca Film Festival, members of the cast and crew discussed all things “Handmaid’s Tale,” including how the source material for the adaptation of Atwood’s incredibly prescient novel leaves the door wide open for an expanded version of the story for TV.  “When the book ends, the reaction is fury, because the way it ends is so cut off,” showrunner Bruce Miller told audiences on Friday night. “And so in some ways, immediately, the first thing you think of is ― how are we going to expand this story? Because that’s what your desire is as a reader.” The book, he noted, is written strictly from the perspective of Offred ― one of the many handmaids living in the theocratic dictatorship known as Gilead, who are forced to function as sexual surrogates for leaders of the republic. In this indeterminate future version of the United States, sterility has become an overwhelming issue, resulting in a return to “traditional” values and widespread subjugation of women, particularly those of lower social standing who are capable of bearing children for more powerful men.  “The book is so strictly from Offred’s point of view, that you hear about all of these amazing, interesting worlds and all of these parts of all of these things that are going on, but you don’t see any of them going on in the book,” Miller explained. “That, to me, as a TV series [showrunner], seemed like ... once you create this world, you have a lot of places to go.” “I wanted to know more,” he added. “I wanted to know what happens next. The end of the book is quite a mystery, so I get to make it up.” The first three episodes of the Hulu series certainly center around the life of Offred (Elisabeth Moss), once a free mother and wife who’s now forced to live with, serve and produce children for a high-ranking commander in Gilead’s militant regime. But we’re also given a glimpse into the worlds of fellow handmaid Ofglen (Alexis Bledel), Offred’s best friend from college Moira (Samira Wiley), the commander’s wife Serena Joy (Yvonne Strahovski), handmaid trainer Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd), and even the commander himself (Joseph Fiennes). “You might not stay with Offred the whole time,” teased “Lemonade” cinematographer Reed Morano, the director of the first three “Handmaid’s” episodes. Executive producer Warren Littlefield was more than willing to entertain the idea of future “Handmaid’s Tale” seasons as well: The landscape of television right now is such an exciting playground for artists. The audience asks, each and every year, to only get more complex in character and more complex in story. Look at who’s up on stage. Each and every one of these actors ― the characters that they play ― there’s so much to explore. Where a limited series is certainly thriving right now in the television landscape, Bruce has years and the struggle continues. God knows it’s relevant. So [...] we’ve only scratched the surface in the first 10 hours and our hope is that we leave you with, “Oh, I have to have more.” “The Handmaid’s Tale” will premiere on Hulu on April 26. Meantime, here are some images from the show to get you excited:"

By Jil Picariello, ZEALnyc Theater Editor, December 26, 2016 If you took the movies Defending Your Life and Final Destination (the third one, to be specific) and mixed them in a blender with Glee and then put the result on a stage, you might get Ride the Cyclone. It's a weird little musical comedy about a horrific disaster: six members of the Saint Cassian High School Chamber Choir of Uranium City, Saskatchewan meet their tragic demise when a roller coaster goes off the rails. Yes, they're dead. But now, thanks to a mechanical fortune teller (add Big to the mix), they discover that one of them can return to life, via a unanimous vote of the group. Each defends his life in turn, the Tracy Flick-ish Ocean O'Connell Rosenberg (her parents were uber-hippes), chubby and schlubby Constance Blackwood (her catchphrase is ""I'm sorry""), Ukranian-born would-be rapper Mischa Bachinski, Marlene Dietrich wannabe Noel Gruber, fantasy lover Ricky Potts, and a spooky sixth contestant identified only as Jane Doe, because she, literally, lost her head in the fatal accident and remains unidentified. All of the performances are terrific, revealing both the teenage cliché of their characters, as well as the genuine human being underneath. And it's charmingly pulled together by director and choreographer Rachel Rockwell, doing a fine service to the hilarious, inventive, and often surprising work of writers Brooke Maxwell and Jacob Richmond. It's creepy, it's campy, it's touching, and, for a musical about a bunch of dead teenagers, it's very funny. Take a ride. ____________________ Ride the Cyclone at the Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, through December 29, 2016. Running time is 1 hour and 30 minutes with no intermission.

POLITICS,"Vice President Mike Pence wants special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the probe into possible connections between Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia, to “wrap it up.” On Thursday morning, NBC’s Andrea Mitchell interviewed Pence and asked about Mueller. She first pressed Pence on whether Mueller could be trusted. Pence didn’t answer that question or her follow-up about whether “this investigation is a hoax.”  Instead, Pence responded, “What I think is that it’s been about a year since this investigation began. Our administration has provided over a million documents. We’ve fully cooperated in it. And in the interest of the country, I think it’s time to wrap it up. I would very respectfully encourage the special counsel and his team to bring their work to completion.” .@MitchellReports asks @VP if he thinks Bob Mueller’s investigation is a “hoax” pic.twitter.com/ec9kaiqN0t His comment raised a red flag for “Morning Joe” host Joe Scarborough, who mentioned the interview with Mitchell on his show on MSNBC later that morning.  Scarborough theorized that Pence might not be revealing all that he knows about the investigation, particularly about former national security adviser Michael Flynn. “Mike Pence has been claiming that he was just out in the dark,” said Scarborough. .@JoeNBC reacts to Mike Pence's remarks on Mueller investigation pic.twitter.com/ONpApSxIBB “And that he was just this clueless, hapless Indiana Hoosier that Donald Trump and the rest of the White House said nothing to. But you’ve just got to start asking yourself, if Mike Pence wants to kill an investigation that is pursuing how the Russians tried to undermine American democracy in 2016 — my gosh, makes me sad to say this … but I guess we have to start asking the question why does Mike Pence want to kill this investigation?” Scarborough called Pence the “Spiro Agnew for the Trump administration,” referring to Richard Nixon’s first vice president, who resigned after pleading no contest to an income tax evasion charge."
ARTS & CULTURE," The Long Way Home, 2014. Oil on canvas, 90 X 140 cm. Canadian-born artist Melanie Daniel, whose work is currently on view at the Shulamit Gallery in Venice Beach, has lived in Israel for the past twenty years, including seven years in the mixed Arab-Jewish city of Jaffa. Her most recent paintings, which are vivid and thematically multivarious, are ruminations on personal identity that also reflect the hybrid culture and socio-political tensions of her adopted homeland.  I recently interviewed Melanie Daniel to ask her about her background, her art and her sources of artistic inspiration.  John Seed Interviews Melanie Daniel:  Melanie Daniel Tell me about growing up in Canada and how it shaped you.  I grew up in a city called Kelowna, British Columbia, nestled in a beautiful valley of forests, lakes and orchards. It is extremely arid and blazingly hot in the summer (up to 40 °C) and then winter inevitably comes and outdoor life continues on the ski slopes or in the gentler woods for snow-shoeing and tobogganing. My younger sister and brother and I were always outdoors in all seasons hunting for critters and frogs, fishing in the creeks or excavating clay from the cliffs behind our grandparents' house. We returned daily to our childhood haunts where only kids went, a parallel universe for us and our posse.  Those were different times, I realize now, and we were never supervised. Free to roam, we invented games, dares, bizarre rituals, and protocol for deep forest sport. The neighborhood creek, an all-season kid headquarters, also served as the final resting place for countless pet gerbils and lizards. At sunset, our deceased beloved pets were regularly sent downstream on blazing Viking ships improvised with popsicle sticks. On less somber occasions, being the avid pyromaniacs that we were, more than once we watched from a safe distance as the local firefighters extinguished the contraband Playboys that had started it all. My brother and his nervous friends would frequently incinerate their forbidden erotic stash once discovered by us, their older sisters, the killjoys.  Although we would have happily watched endless hours of TV sitcoms and cartoons, my parents were frequently heard saying, ""shut that thing off and go outside"", which we grudgingly did. But ""outside"" never disappointed. It was always a place to escape into and to be happy. The dead silence of snow, the smell of cut grass, the deafening drone of cicadas in afternoons and the melancholy return of autumn and the dreaded classroom - the reliable cycle of my formative years in Canada. It has never left me.   Wrestling Bears, 2015. Oil on canvas, 99 X 101 cm. Why did you move to Israel and what kind of culture shock did you feel?  Love brought me to this place. Not adventure and certainly not ideology. In the early '90's I travelled through India and one day I set my eyes upon a curly haired, dark stranger. I was sure he was Italian.  I knew nothing of Israelis. After a while, each returned to his respective country and only many months later did we commence a slow correspondence through posted letters. Email was not yet widely available. Rather impulsively, I dropped my final year of university studies in history and philosophy and boarded a plane for Israel, certain that I would be greeted by a swollen silver moon over Jerusalem. Nothing could have been further from the truth. Jerusalem was a rough city, its denizens crustier still. I returned briefly to Canada to make some money tree-planting and ultimately to figure out what to do about this man. Eventually I did return to Jerusalem, and I knew that my success or failure would depend less on matters of the heart and more about what I would do there.  Soon after my arrival, the prime minister was assassinated, later the second Intifada was unleashed, and all hell broke loose. It lasted five years and it changed everyone, deeply. Perennial engagement with mortality is humbling. I live in constant proof of the fragility of life and it's something that follows me everywhere. And although I don't believe that this knowledge gives me any advantages in life it has sharpened a keen regard I've always held for the present tense and a solid respect for the material/natural world. Communion with nature has always been enough for me and requires no further pontificating from men with snowy beards. The culture shock I experienced here was an ongoing hiccup, lasting years. Israelis are without a doubt the most tactless humans on earth but this abrasive quality has a very important flip side. They also happen to be the most generous, candid, creative and humorous people I have ever met. I have learned much from my Israeli friends. The other culture shock was Israel's natural landscape, the desert and its open unforgiving sky. I recoiled at my first encounter with the desert; I felt I had no where to hide. It took me many years to embrace this existential landscape as it was nothing like the towering pine giants that protected me in my youth.  Patchwork Landing, 2015. Oil on canvas, 140 X 160 cm Your art has been characterized as dreamlike. Have your narratives always been this way?   Yes, I think so. Even at school I was painting when the craft was decidedly unpopular and to the dismay of my instructors, I was also bent on weaving impenetrable stories into the work. For me, the paintings invent the places and characters, not the other way around. My paintings are so much about physicality which despite their reliance on narrative are still somehow resistant to language, interpretation, or even memory.    I hope to induce a sense of dislocation by being both strange and recognizable. By keeping the narrative dreamlike and just beyond reach, I let the viewer bring something of their own to the painting. The narrative can unfold once the sense of familiarity recedes from the encounter, those scenes familiar to us through the landscape genre. My art is anti-nostalgic because I don't try rehashing actual experiences but invent them at the edge of my perception.  Scruffy's Emerald Secret, 2014-15. Oil on canvas, 140 X 120 cm

Can you tell me about one of your current paintings and break down some of its narrative and themes?  One piece, Scruffy's Emerald Secret is a favorite of mine. It's moodier that the others and I can identify with the bare-footed loner sitting on a tree stump, hunched over his campfire. Behind him looms this tall green patterned tree, a beautiful freak specimen. It shouldn't be there, but it is. The man shouldn't be there, but he is. Where is his family? Why is he alone in keeping vigil over this odd tree? This piece is one of several in a group I call Piecemaker in which I incorporate conflicting cultural motifs, embedded traditional Arabic patterns in a Canadian landscape. They can't be fused and remain irreconcilable. Not unlike quilt-making I ""stitch"" together disparate symbolic forms and patterns from both of these worlds which have become part of me.   Spellbound, 2014. Oil on canvas, 140 X 180 cm. As you have dealt with the cultural and political challenges of living and working in Israel, how has your art sustained you?  One of the conditions of my decision to remain here depended on my ability to carve out a corner for myself, professionally. Making art and functioning competitively in that arena was a necessity for happiness and my own sanity. I started from zero and got a very good education and training in the arts. Self discipline was already established from my previous five years at Canadian universities, and I was very sure about how I wanted things to play out. Unlike many immigrants who arrive as adults, I had a huge advantage: art school was a big lingering bear hug. All of my friends, my political views, professional networks, and direct access to Israel's cultural carotid artery were all gifted to me during those years.  I would not have survived here without it.   The Drifting Patch Tree, 2015. Oil on canvas, 190 X 180 cm What are your interests outside of art?   My family is the heart of my life, always. Everything else falls into descending order after that. I like being outside as much as possible. As a family, we do a lot of hiking and swimming, and picnics with friends. I live a street away from the Mediterranean Sea and need to see it daily. Most days are started with a run along the sea to stave off cabin fever in my studio.  I'm an avid gardener and a member of a community garden and often get my son's kindergarten involved with horticulture. It's important for kids to understand where food comes from and to really see how we're all part of a shared life cycle. They also get a real sense of pride and ownership from their hard work. I read a lot, everything from Annie Proulx to Walter Mosley, mostly at night when everyone is asleep. Music, nonstop, but that's when I'm painting.  Who are some artists who have directly influenced your work?  Daniel Richter: he's the best living painter as far as I'm concerned. I can look at as his works for hours and they just keep unfolding. Violent and absurd, apocalyptic. Peter Doig: a constant source of  inspiration.  Cecily Brown: fleshy, carnal paintings that just disintegrate and then re-galvanize, pulsing. They take time to get into and you can't hurry them. This is one of the things what makes any good painting last. Brown overdoes everything, pushes the painting to the brink and I love that . Mark Bradford: layer by layer, he builds up a thick-skinned topography from cultural detritus.  It's like he maps out these strange mute neighborhoods replete with their own secrets and you want to scrape down to get to them. Velazquez: bold mark-making and outbursts of sensuality erupting through thick globs of paint. He didn't want a smooth porcelain finish but rather wanted to show us the true corporeal surface of paint.  For me, moving paint around is a steady point of fascination and Velazquez always delivers the goods in that regard.    Dana Schutz: she's madly prolific, restless, ballsy, and brilliant. I hit a wall over ten years ago and discovered Dana's work. It was like rocket fuel for me. David Lynch:  His scenes are permanently lodged in my brain. An unapologetic storyteller of storytelling.   Sally Mann: raw, haunting and achingly personal.  Kwakiutl and Haida  art and myths: I grew up with the imagery and stories of First Nations peoples of the Pacific Northwest. Masks and totems and legends are always with me even if they don't find immediate expression in what I do.  PK Page: Canadian poet. Her vivid descriptions of fleeting moments of life hang in the air when I'm working. I just have to reach up and grab them. Here's a title: ""Deaf-Mute in the Pear Tree"". James Ensor -  He literally attacked his canvases with violent gusto, making these taut, weird and nightmarish scenes. Totally unsettling.  Melanie Daniel: Piecemaker

BUSINESS,"A former Volkswagen AG executive received the maximum sentence on Wednesday of seven years in prison and a $400,000 fine for his role in the company’s emissions scandal.  Oliver Schmidt ― a German native who worked in the U.S. as Volkswagen’s top emissions compliance manager ― had pleaded guilty in August to two charges in the case of Volkswagen altering its diesel cars to evade U.S. emission standards, reported The Detroit News.   One charge was conspiracy to defraud the U.S., and the other was violating the Clean Air Act.  “This crime ... attacks and destroys the very foundation of our economic system: That is trust,” U.S. District Judge Sean Cox of Detroit said in court, according to the outlet.  In September 2015, the German automaker admitted it had rigged close to 11 million cars worldwide ― including 500,000 cars in the U.S. ― with secret software that would cheat on emissions tests to appear more environmentally friendly.  The scandal has cost the company close to $30 billion.  Other executives from Volkswagen, as well as the company itself, are still under investigation in Germany and facing lawsuits from investors in the U.S. Earlier this year, former Volkswagen engineer James Liang was sentenced to 40 months in prison for his role in the scandal. Liang has since appealed his sentence.   At the time, the same judge, Cox, ordered Liang to pay a $200,000 fine ― 10 times the amount sought by federal prosecutors, reported Reuters. The judge said Liang had participated in a “stunning fraud on the American consumer ... a very serious and troubling crime against our economic system.” "

We ranked everyone based on their survey responses and geographical census data to figure out who most needed money,” the site explains. “The poorest 100 people received a check for $1,000, paid for by everyone else.”  The company included remarks from some of the initiative’s beneficiaries on its website: Kristi from Michigan said the money “would mean so much” to her, as she and her husband are taking care of her niece “for the foreseeable future because her parents aren’t capable of doing so” and “are in the process of becoming licensed foster parents.” SrCow from California said hemophilia has slowed down his work and that he’s currently trying to save $10,000 for his upcoming nuptials, honeymoon and a future home. “The $1,000 dollars will go towards our $10K goal. It will make us 10% closer to a small wedding, but a big future together,” he said. Courtney from Florida said the “$1,000 will help ensure that my bills are paid, strengthening a cushion/emergency repair account I’ve been trying to build all year.”  Cards Against Humanity says its move was driven by the harrowing statistic that “eight men own the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of humanity.” The company also said it initially wanted to launch a “campaign to eat all the rich people and live in their houses,” but its lawyers advised against that, so it “settled for something more achievable.”  The company also said its “Cards Against Humanity Saves America” initiative has enabled it to purchase “a plot of vacant land on the US/Mexico border and retain a law firm specializing in eminent domain to make it as time-consuming and expensive as possible for Trump to build his preposterous wall.” Other outcomes included cards, thank you notes from children, and a policy paper written by the Chicago Children’s Museum in partnership with DonorsChoose to “support teachers who are creating alternatives to traditional homework.” You can read all the stories Card Against Humanity shared here."
ARTS & CULTURE," “I need a lot of external stimulation bulleting into my life,” Richard Ford said in an interview with The Paris Review. “I’m not talking about exhilaration or thrill, I just want new sounds coming into my ears.” He’s referring to working on planes, in friends’ houses, in hotel rooms -- to constantly being in motion. He’s not interior enough, he says, to stay in one place, to sit down, to focus, to plant roots.  Perhaps not coincidentally, Ford’s writing is complemented by the way it sounds. More so than the meaning they invoke, Ford chooses words for the feelings they stir up. A long “o” might be soothing; a long “a” is dark and unsettling. Like Ford, Deborah Levy’s writing relies heavily on its sounds. In particular her first two novels, recently republished, are ripe with onomatopoeia. A central character can be heard wailing from dorm hallways; another wears seashells near her ears so she can always hear the ocean. Also like Ford, her novels -- particularly Beautiful Mutants -- is about characters who are uprooted, who spend their days wandering around a whir of foreign stimuli.  Mutants centers on Lapinski, a Russian immigrant who tries to make London her home after the death of her parents. Bequeathed with nothing other than a handkerchief embroidered with her family name, she grows thick skin while navigating the strange sounds of a new city. Her upstairs neighbor is a noisy misogynist; her friend Gemma speaks in shrill, drawn-out platitudes; she bides her time and pays her rent by working in a bustling shop where an array of languages are spoken.  Levy’s at her best here when characterizing the colorful, disorienting nature of the immigrant experience. Her later books -- Black Vodka, a short story collection, and Swimming Home, a Booker-nominated novella -- have been lauded for their ability to build tense atmospheres and construct anxiety-inducing moods. So, when Beautiful Mutants showcases her playful use of language, it makes for an immersive, empathy-inducing reading experience.  The abstract nature of Levy’s writing is a pleasure; reading Mutants is like listening to a soundtrack for feelings of isolation, longing and confusion. However, in parts, Levy imbues her own political observations in clunky ways she thankfully abandons in her later works. In Mutants, Lapinski’s poet-friend, a rambling, self-centered love interest who speaks chiefly in metaphor, has absurd, drawn-out conversations with a zoo animal, weighing the value of capitalism by the virtues of intrinsic motivation.  If this sounds like a forced allegory, that’s because it is: the poet’s reflections fall short of the metaphor-riddled world of Animal Farm, which seems to’ve been the goal. These random interludes distract from Levy’s otherwise fluid, skillfully crafted scenes, which for the most part immerse the reader in the complex, bustling world of London.  The Bottom Line:
Deborah Levy's earlier books are a sonorous, whimsical introduction to the immigrant experience in London.  Who wrote it?
Deborah Levy is the author of Swimming Home, the Booker-nominated novella, and a collection of short stories, Black Vodka.  Who will read it?

ARTS & CULTURE,"“Women artists have always been sidelined,” Bianca Chu, deputy director at Sotheby’s S|2 Gallery, told HuffPost.  Her opinion is hardly unfounded. Over the years, there have been widespread efforts by feminist activists to address the ongoing gender imbalance in the museum and gallery worlds, imploring individuals and institutions to learn more women artists’ names, put more women’s work in galleries and museums, and document more women’s contributions to art on Wikipedia and in history books.  Chu and the team at London’s S|2 Gallery are working to address one imbalance in particular: market value. The gallery, a space adjacent to Sotheby’s auction house in London, is launching a series of exhibitions featuring the work of female artists who are historically influential, yet remain undervalued for a variety of reasons.  For the first show in this vein, S|2 is showing the work of Renate Bertlmann and Maria Lassnig, two postwar artists from Austria whose reputations and market costs don’t add up. Bertlmann, born in Vienna in 1943, is an avant-garde feminist artist whose work incorporated dildos, pacifiers and condoms to defuse what she referred to as the “phallocracy.” In one series, Bertlmann paints phalluses as pastel-colored cartoons donning corsets and garter belts. Throughout her career, Bertlmann depicted penises in many forms over and over again, each time chipping away at the unspoken patriarchal power possessed within them.  “Pornographic jokes have always been a male domain, made at the exclusive expense of women,” Bertlmann said in an interview with the Tate museum in London. “I consider my series of objects an accomplished example of an obscene female joke. This joke has hit home; it targets the deadly serious, male sexual arrogance.” When Bertlmann began exhibiting her work in the 1970s, she was criticized by other feminist artists for her obsession with phallic imagery. “People thought that because she was using phalluses in such a direct way she was empowering them,” Chu said. “But really, by using them so bluntly, she was trying to overcome them.” In another iconic work, Bertlmann covers a mask with the tips of baby pacifiers, which bear resemblance to nipples and condoms, both of which were, again, frequent materials in her work. In a series of staged photos, Bertlmann wears the mask atop her face, covering her fingers with condoms. The monstrous image visualizes woman as baby-making machine, her physical features buried beneath the responsibilities of sexually accommodation and reproduction.  The other artist on view is Maria Lassnig, who was born in 1919 in Kappel am Krappfeld, a small town in southern Austria. For 70 years, Lassnig painted only herself, assuming a variety of disguises including a baby, a cheese grater, a monster and a dumpling.  The artist described her gripping self-portraits as “body-awareness paintings” ― in that they reflected as much as possible how she was feeling at the moment of their creation. She never painted from photographs, always from life. “I need the real body, real air,” she is quoted as saying in The Guardian. “When I paint I want everything to be as direct as possible.” Lassnig’s depictions range from figurative to abstract, naturalistic to teetering on the edge of reality, her flesh shifting from salmon pink to electric green ― all dependent on the artist’s inner state at the time of the images’ creation.  In her most well-known work, 2005’s “You or Me,” Lassnig paints her unclothed, 85-year-old body, the flesh yellowy and loose. Her face appears vacant yet alarmed. With one hand, Lassnig holds a gun to her head; she points another gun at the viewer with the other. The portrait is painful to look at yet impossible to look away from, as if warning the viewer that if she breaks eye contact Lassnig will shoot.  “She has been active since the 1950s,” Chu explained, “but it’s only in the last decade or so that she’s had major museum retrospectives outside of her own country.” Lassnig was awarded the Golden Lion lifetime achievement award at the Venice Biennale in 2013 and died the next year, at 94 years old.  Despite the critical recognition she’s received, her work is still priced in an entirely different bracket than, say, Francis Bacon’s, with whom she exhibited (and held her own) in 2016. While Bacon’s work has sold for up to $142 million, Lassnig’s record, according to Chu, hovers around $600,000.  The first round of S|2 Gallery’s programming focuses on women artists, but future shows will explore work that is undervalued for a variety of reasons. Chu stressed that the exhibitions will place more emphasis on the artist’s work as opposed to the explanations behind their exclusion. “Certain artists have been marginalized because of gender or race, but we are more interested in their rediscovery,” Chu said. “There are always a variety of factors, but we’re focusing on the art they are making.”  The time is ripe for serious attention to be paid to artists as groundbreaking as Bertlmann and Lassnig. And if those auction prices go up as a result, all the better.  Renate Bertlmann’s work is on view now in S|2 Gallery’s lower gallery, and Maria Lassnig’s in the upper gallery. The London show is on view until June 1. "
BUSINESS,"Several male supervisors at a Verizon-contracted warehouse in Memphis, Tennessee, groped, sexually propositioned and harassed eight current and former female employees, according to charges the women filed last month at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency that handles civil rights employment cases. One woman says her boss at the fulfillment center, where workers pack and ship Verizon products, came by to offer her a peppermint, dropped it in her hand, then reached down and grabbed her breast. Another woman’s boss grabbed her buttocks while he was walking by with a colleague, according to her complaint. After she reported the incident to the human resources department, her boss treated her more “harshly,” and wrote her up for not working ― falsely, she says in the complaint. She quit in January. Filed in two batches at the EEOC in early and late April, the charges show what pervasive, systemic sexual harassment looks like for low-wage workers of color ― the warehouse workers are primarily African American ― who are often an afterthought in the recent spate of Me Too stories, which tend to focus on high-profile men and more elite, typically white, women. While the first batch of charges got some local press attention, the discrimination claims filed in late April have not been previously reported. In this case, the discrimination charges were not filed against Verizon nor do they involve the company’s employees. Instead, workers have filed their claims against their direct employer, XPO Logistics, a multibillion-dollar global firm that owns the warehouse and contracts with Verizon. On Wednesday, ahead of Verizon’s shareholder meeting, the National Women’s Law Center, a women’s economic rights nonprofit, and four other groups sent a letter to Verizon CEO and chairman Lowell McAdam, urging him to address complaints of sexual harassment at the Memphis facility. Other signers include the women’s nonprofit A Better Balance, the Tennessee branch of the NAACP and SisterReach, a women’s rights nonprofit that is focused of women of color in the South. The president of SAG-AFTRA, a union that represents actors, singers and other entertainers, also signed on. “The XPO warehouse reportedly exhibits a toxic culture that runs contrary to Verizon’s stated policies and practices,” says the letter, provided exclusively to HuffPost on Tuesday. The letter notes that McAdam has been a vocal supporter of women’s rights. The CEO recently proclaimed a zero tolerance policy for harassment at Makers, a women’s conference run by Verizon-owned Oath. (Oath is also HuffPost’s parent company.) “As community leaders, and women’s rights advocates engaged in legal and policy work to fight against sexual harassment and active in the Times Up and MeToo campaigns and movements, we are deeply concerned with how Verizon ensures safe and dignified working conditions for the workers in its supply chain,” the letter says. The writers ask for a meeting with Verizon to further discuss the situation. HuffPost alerted Verizon to the letter on Tuesday night. The company said this was the first it heard about the situation in Memphis. “We are undertaking an immediate investigation into the matter,” Verizon spokesman Bob Varettoni told HuffPost on Wednesday, after looking at the charges.  Later that day, lawyers from both companies met to discuss the allegations, according to a letter sent to XPO from Verizon, broadly outlining their discussion and next steps. “These are very disturbing and serious allegations,” Verizon’s attorneys write. “Verizon expects XPO Logistics to utilize all measures available to fully investigate the charges and take prompt and decisive remedial action if the facts warrant it.” Verizon also said that it expects frequent updates on the investigation and that it will monitor XPOs actions. The updates and investigation will “inform the basis of any decisions Verizon makes regarding the future of our contractual relationship with XPO.” The letter was addressed to two XPO executives, including in-house lawyer Richard Valitutto. According to the harassment charges, Valitutto was also employed by the warehouse’s previous owners, New Breed Logistics, when it was sued for sexual harassment in 2010. The company lost that case, and a judge ordered the warehouse to closely monitor for sexual harassment issues. It’s not clear what happened after that. A spokesman for XPO declined to comment on the specifics of the claims but said that the company had only reviewed the charges filed in early April and had not yet seen the late April filings. “Our culture promotes safety and respect. We have no tolerance for any form of harassment,” an XPO spokesman told HuffPost. “We promptly investigate all claims brought to our attention.” The charges raise questions about the responsibilities big companies have in dealing with the behavior of their contractors. It’s a struggle that’s somewhat analogous to what happens in the retail industry, where big labels outsource manufacturing overseas. Other tech firms, including Facebook, do hold their contractors to various standards ― including minimum wages and benefits requirements. Many, including Verizon, say they have zero tolerance for harassment at any firm they do business with. Those kind of policies will increasingly be put to the test as the Me Too movement matures. It’s possible that the next phase will spread to these fairly common arrangements, where big-name companies outsource labor needs to U.S. companies with a far lower profile. “Part of this moment demands greater accountability for preventing and addressing workplace harassment,” said Emily Martin, general counsel at the National Women’s Law Center, which has signed on to the letter. Companies like Verizon should pay attention not only to the treatment of their own workers but also to those who fall under their corporate umbrella, she said. They have a lot of power to make change. “Verizon has a really important voice around the conversation they should use that power to stand up for the workers who are trying to seek justice,” said Martin, who also oversees some legal work for Time’s Up, the anti-harassment initiative created by women in Hollywood in the wake of the Me Too movement. The women who filed these claims are hourly workers who don’t earn a lot of money, and many are the sole breadwinners for their family, grateful for the hourly work and full-time benefits, despite the hazards of the job, said Gloria Sweet-Love, president of the NAACP in Tennessee, which signed the letter. The racial aspects of the harassment allegations are hard to miss, as the female workers at the plant are mainly African American and their supervisors’ mostly white men, according to the letter from the groups. One woman alleging discrimination said her supervisor regularly made sexual comments to the women who worked under him, calling one his “chocolate baby.” “They’re getting the same kind of racist pathetic treatment that people in the South got for generations,” said Sweet-Love, who noted she’s met with many workers inside the XPO facility, where employees are often working long and inconsistent hours, desperate to hang on to the full-time work that comes with benefits ― a rarity for low-wage workers in Memphis. “These eight women are just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many more. Everybody in there is being mistreated and overworked,” she said. The facility’s previous owner, New Breed Logistics, was sued by the EEOC in 2010 for harassment and retaliation involving three female temp workers in Memphis. A jury found in favor of the victims, with a $1.5 million judgment. A federal judge ordered the company to monitor complaints and issues going forward. However, while the case was on appeal, XPO bought the facility. Verizon contracted with New Breed, as well. According to the lawyer who filed the current crop of charges, XPO continues to employ executives who were there when the last suit was filed, including its human resources director and corporate counsel Valitutto.  This article has been updated with details of Verizon’s letter to XPO.  Have you experienced sexual harassment or discrimination where you work?

by Blake Gopnik  THE DAILY PIC: These two images are from the exhibition called “Warhol by the Book"", which opened on the weekend at the Williams College Museum of Art in Williamstown, Mass., as a collaboration with the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. (A smaller version will also travel to the Morgan Library in New York.) Today's two Pics are for book covers, one realized and one not, and capture one of the most important take-homes from this important show about Warhol and publishing: That Andy's work, especially in the 1950s, was deeply bound up with his being gay, and was usually best when it was gay-est. (When it's completely “straight"", as with his children's book illustrations, it can often be undistinguished.) The book cover at right was for a novel of Venice called The Desire and Pursuit of the Whole, written by Frederick Rolfe, the “Baron Corvo"", in about 1913 and re-published in 1953 by New Directions Books, which used Warhol on a number of projects. In his forward to the volume, the gay poet W. H. Auden said that the book gives a view of the world “through the eyes of a homosexual paranoid."" Warhol's cover gets at the subtle tensions involved in being gay in 1950s New York (or turn-of-the-century Venice): The two men in the image are close as they could be shown but, as it were, no cigar. As curator and archivist Matt Wrbican has discovered, Warhol gave a copy of the cover to his close gay friend Ralph “Corkie"" Ward, with the smaller figure inscribed “This is a drawing of you."" The image at left, inscribed with the words “Fat Fairies: A Book for Fairies"", is most probably a first idea for the cover of a self-published artist's book that Warhol finally produced as In the Bottom of my Garden – a reference to the song ""There are Fairies in the Bottom of Our Garden"", from the repertoire of the comic singer Beatrice Lillie, but leaving out the title's one crucial word. (Warhol once depicted Lillie.) The original cover idea may have been too direct even for Warhol's most intimate, and mostly queer, circle. Anyway, the circumlocutions, misdirections and obliquities that were forced on Warhol by his culture's homophobia led him to devise an art of glorious misdirection, circumlocution and obliquity, whatever its subject matter or audience. (Fat Fairies is from The Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh, founding collection, contribution of The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc., © The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.; Desire and Pursuit of the Whole is also from The Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh, gift of Matt Wrbican) For a full survey of past Daily Pics visit blakegopnik.com/archive. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUSINESS,"A federal judge heard arguments Wednesday in a case that could put Uber’s self-driving car development on hiatus, based on claims from rival Waymo that Uber stole some of its trade secrets. Waymo, a Google-spinoff, is seeking an injunction against Uber’s program, effectively halting it for the duration of the trial. Self-driving vehicles are central to Uber’s long-term business strategy, so halting work on them could have severe financial repercussions for the company. At the heart of the case is a technology called LiDAR that helps an autonomous vehicle map out and navigate its surroundings as it’s driving. Waymo lawyers presented evidence that a former executive named Anthony Levandowski downloaded Waymo’s LiDAR designs, along with some 14,000 other documents, before he left the company in January 2016. Soon after Levandowski left, he started a competitor company named “Otto” that was purchased by Uber for $680 million less than a year later. Waymo lawyer Charles Verhoeven portrayed Otto as little more than a shell company, founded by Levandowski for no other purpose than selling valuable, confidential technology to Uber. And while U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup conceded, speaking of Waymo’s evidence, that he’s “never seen a record this strong in 42 years,” ultimately the company struggled to prove that Uber asked Levandowski to steal Waymo’s files on Uber’s behalf. That matters, since Waymo is suing Uber ― not Levandowski. “I’m listening very carefully to see the proof that shows that Uber was aware that he downloaded information,” Alsup told Charles Verhoeven. “That would be pretty damning if you had that.” Verhoeven maintained that proof does exist, but it’s among 3,500 or so documents, which Uber says contain confidential information that it refused to release. Complicating matters, Levandowski has asserted his fifth amendment rights and refused to testify. (He also stepped away from Uber’s LiDAR-related research for the duration of the case). In lieu of the “smoking gun” Alsup sought, Verhoeven presented evidence claiming Levandowski conspired with Uber before he left Waymo. “There was this clandestine plan all along that Uber and Levandowski had a deal,” he said. That evidence includes emails Levandowski exchanged with Uber while he still worked at Waymo, and 5.3 million shares of stock (worth approximately $250 million) Uber granted Levandowski on Jan. 28, 2016, the day after he left Google. Uber responded by clarifying it actually awarded Levandowski the stock months later during the Otto acquisition, but set the vesting date earlier as a courtesy. Uber, represented by outside lawyer Arturo Gonzalez, denied any wrongdoing, as it always has. “We are adamant that we did not use any of their secrets,” he said. Notably, however, Uber also hasn’t gone out of its way to defend Levandowski. Gonzalez said Uber “didn’t have any basis” to dispute that Levandowski downloaded the 14,000 files. While it’s conceivable he brought them into work on a personal laptop and consulted them, Gonzalez said, “There’s no evidence that it happened.” Uber’s ultimate goal is to move the case out of the public spotlight and into arbitration, where this could all be settled privately. The judge is expected to make a decision on the injunction sometime in the next couple weeks. A trial ― should it come to that ― would likely begin sometime in October."
BUSINESS,"It looks like the new CEO of Uber will be a step up for women at the company, though the bar for success is pretty low. The company’s reported pick for chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, is not a woman, as many had hoped, but the 48-year-old is also apparently not your average Silicon Valley tech bro. For starters, Khosrowshahi doesn’t work in Silicon Valley. He’s run travel website Expedia in Seattle for more than a decade. The son of Iranian refugees and an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, Khosrowshahi is a well-liked leader who’s been comparatively honest and upfront about Expedia’s shortcomings when it comes to achieving gender balance. “As part of the Seattle/old Internet world, Khosrowshahi comes from outside Silicon Valley and its strangely entitled ways,” writes Fortune’s Adam Lashinsky. “In other words, he can walk the digital walk, but he’s not part of the oddly constricting mentality that makes it hard for denizens of Silicon Valley to communicate with real people.” He’s also run a company that’s won awards for its work-life balance. That’s not always a perfect indicator that a company is a great place to work, but it’s certainly not a terrible sign.   And judging by the data, Expedia is out way ahead of Uber when it comes to hiring and retaining women. Fifty-one percent of Expedia’s U.S. employees are women, according to company data, and 33 percent of its leadership is female ― a number that’s not high enough, according to Khosrowshahi himself. “While we compare well with many of our technology peers, we have a long way to go in bringing more female representation into leadership roles,” Khosrowshahi said last year in a press release. “We need to attract, hire, engage and promote talent of all kinds all around the world, and we believe that by enriching the diversity of our work force across all dimensions, including gender, we achieve the most enriched outcomes.” Lately, Khosrowshahi has distinguished himself with some strong criticism of the Trump administration. Earlier this year, on a call with Wall Street analysts, he said darkly, “Hopefully we will all be alive to see the end of next year.”  His most recent tweet was a direct hit at the president. “I keep waiting for the moment when our Prez will rise to the expectations of his office and he fails, repeatedly,” Khosrowshahi  tweeted, sharing a story about Trump’s equivocation on white supremacists. I keep waiting for the moment when our Prez will rise to the expectations of his office and he fails, repeatedly. https://t.co/WlxTkRfC71 Former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, on the other hand, took a much more cautious approach to Trump. He drew criticism from his own employees for serving on Trump’s economic advisory council. At an internal meeting back in January, he told employees, “We’ll partner with anyone in the world as long they’re about making transportation ... better.”  Kalanick finally stepped down from the council after Uber customers started boycotting the company in the wake of Trump’s Muslim ban. He also resisted efforts to diversify Uber ― even refusing to give internal recruiters access to data on gender and race at the company ― up until the very end of his tenure.  At Uber, 36 percent of full-timers in the U.S. and Canada are women, and just 22 percent of the leadership team is female, according to the company’s internal data. And, of course, Uber has been under fire for the way it treats women since last February, when a former Uber engineer published a blog post detailing how she was sexually harassed by her boss there ― and how his behavior was ignored and tacitly approved of by the company.  The blog post helped bring about Kalanick’s ouster in June. He is still on the company’s board, however, and has reportedly played a role in selecting his successor. Uber declined to comment. Kalanick had a terrible track record when it came to sexism ― once referring to his company as “boober” because of how it helped him attract women. Kalanick’s ex-girlfriend Gabi Holzwarth, 27, told HuffPost in March that he essentially treated women as decoration.   If there were women around at all, outside of work, they were more likely to be models than other executives, she said. “You go to an event and there’s just a bunch of models they’ve flown in,” Holzwarth told HuffPost. “That’s what they like to play with. That’s pretty much it.” So, Khosrowshahi ― who reportedly spends a lot of time outside work with his family ― wouldn’t have to do all that much to improve on Kalanick’s behavior.  And he’s already got a road map for success. Former Attorney General Eric Holder gave the company a 13-page report on how to improve the way it treats its employees."
POLITICS,"Several Democratic officials are asking Hillary Clinton to return the money that the Democratic National Committee paid her political group for her campaign email list and other resources. In February 2017, the DNC agreed to pay Clinton’s group Onward Together $1.65 million for her campaign email list, analytics, donor data and related items, The Intercept reported on Wednesday. The cache of material was worth more than $5 million; Clinton’s campaign made an in-kind donation of resources worth $3.5 million, and the DNC paid for the rest. Now a number of Democratic Party officials, including some state party chairs and DNC members, want Clinton to retroactively donate the campaign materials to the DNC and return the money that the party organ gave Onward Together.  “She should return the money for the ‘love of the Democratic Party’ to the DNC for its use,” said Alabama Democratic Party chairwoman Nancy Worley, who supported Clinton during the 2016 primary. Wisconsin Democratic Party chairwoman Martha Laning and Missouri Democratic National Committeeman Curtis Wylde likewise called on her to retroactively donate it and return the payment. And Nebraska Democratic Party chairwoman Jane Kleeb, who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 primary, argued that Clinton could also contribute the equivalent money to state Democratic parties. Other DNC officials, including at-large member Brian Wahby and Kansas Democratic National Committeeman Chris Reeves, welcomed an in-kind donation but stopped short of asking for it. “It would be a Christian thing to do,” Wahby said. Sanders’ office did not return a request for comment on whether the senator agrees.  Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, defended the price tag on Thursday on the grounds that the DNC has already reaped far more than it paid for the email list in fundraising so far. “Paying a rental fee for use of an email list is common practice, and in this case the DNC has raised over $30 million with it, an 1,800 [percent] return on their investment,” Merrill wrote in an email to Fox News. (The DNC purchased the email list to own, rather than renting its information.) Merrill did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment on calls to retroactively make the resources an in-kind contribution and return the money already received. Xochitl Hinojosa, a DNC spokeswoman, agreed that the DNC had gotten “a return on our investment and more since obtaining all of the lists and data.” Donna Brazile forged the agreement between the Clinton campaign and the DNC in February 2017, while she was serving as interim DNC chairwoman. Brazile, who has been critical of how the Clinton campaign treated the DNC, said she believed the deal would help her successor as DNC chair “inherit a party in good shape.” “I felt that it was a fair bargain at the time,” she said. The current DNC chairman, Tom Perez, has amended the payment schedule, but the core of the accord ― how much the DNC would pay and what it would get in return ― remains in place, according to Hinojosa. The DNC paid Onward Together $300,000 in January and $135,000 in every subsequent month, according to Federal Election Commission filings and information provided by the DNC. Thus far, it has transferred $705,000 to Clinton’s group; as of the end of this month, that sum will have increased to $840,000.  The revelation of the sale of Clinton campaign resources to the DNC has struck a nerve with some Democratic officials because it exemplifies practices that they have criticized for years. These Democrats lament the transactional relationship of Democratic standard-bearers with the DNC and state parties, which often have a harder time fundraising. Former President Barack Obama withheld his campaign email list entirely from the DNC during his first term, using it instead to build his political group, Organizing for America (later renamed Organizing for Action). After Obama’s re-election in 2012, he initially allowed the DNC to use the list free of charge before formally donating it to the party body in 2015. Officials from state parties who joined the Clinton campaign’s joint fundraising agreement during the 2016 election also complained that the campaign left state parties little funding to maintain their operations. Onward Together, which as a 501(c)(4) political nonprofit is not required to disclose its financial data, says it has distributed grants to 11 progressive groups, including Indivisible, Swing Left, Run for Something and Color of Change. However, there are many forms of political organizing that state parties, unlike those groups, are uniquely equipped to do. For example, state parties have historically played important roles in recruiting candidates for state and local office; advising and funding those candidates; and registering and turning out voters in down-ballot races. Another source of tension is what Sanders allies see as a double standard being applied to the Vermont senator’s famously successful campaign email list. Although Sanders was not the Democratic presidential nominee, after the campaign, many Democrats called on Sanders to turn over his list to the DNC. (Sanders has declined to do so.) “They weren’t saying Bernie, ‘Rent your list.’ They wanted the list,” said Jim Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute and a Sanders appointee to the DNC’s Unity and Reform Commission. “They said, ‘All candidates do this ― they turn it over to the party.’ Well, now I find out that they don’t.” Zogby, who refused to comment on the conduct of the Clinton campaign, was one of several reformers who pressed the Unity Commission to recommend the creation of a financial oversight committee at the DNC with full access to the party’s budget data. He hopes that the latest revelation will increase support among the DNC’s membership to approve the oversight committee and other financial transparency measures. The entire DNC membership is due to vote on the proposals in August. “It is critical to the ultimate survival of the party as a viable institution,” Zogby said."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Streamline recommends “Moonrise Kingdom” as the movie you should watch on Hulu this week. The service adds this on Sept. 16. “Moonrise Kingdom” stars two unknown child actors ― Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman ― along with a notable cast of adults that includes Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand and Bruce Willis. Wes Anderson directed this and co-wrote the screenplay with Roman Coppola. The two children run away and try to make a life for themselves together ― a very twee life. Then the adults start looking for them ― in a very twee way. Although the Anderson aesthetic is kind of out right now during this more hardened, ultra-cynical Donald Trump era, I still love this movie. I think you’ll find much to enjoy whether you’re revisiting it or watching for the first time. You can watch the trailer below. And if you want to stay up to date with what to watch on a weekly basis, subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.    “The Queen” stars Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II. She won an Academy Award for the role. The movie has an impressive 97 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. You might also want to consider “American Horror Series: Cult” since that show just returned with new episodes. This “Cult” season focuses on the aftermath of Donald Trump winning the presidential election, albeit in a fictional way.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Don’t mess with librarians.  New York Observer columnist Andre Walker learned that lesson this week when he called for the closure of public libraries, and posted tweets critical of librarians. Nobody goes to libraries anymore. Close the public ones and put the books in schools. https://t.co/Cimy1V81n5 Thousands responded to Walker’s initial tweet, noting the valuable role libraries play in communities. Among the educators and advocates tweeting their responses was Alex “The Angriest Librarian” Halpern:  Hang tight folks, because I am about to drop some necessary knowledge on you. First off, library usage is on the RISE motherfuckers. https://t.co/reWrJj3XCo As conservatives have taken over state and local governments, and the NO MORE TAXES crowd has gotten their way, public space has decreased. That means is that there are a lot fewer free, public gathering places in America anymore. What's one? The motherfucking public library. If you, like this jackalope, think libraries are just warehouses for books, you are sorely and embarrassingly mistaken. Sorely. In addition to meeting a community's need for educational and recreational materials, PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNG FAMILIES... public libraries are evolving to meet the demands of the 21st Century, unlike the neanderthal who sparked this thread. Books? Books make up a RAPIDLY decreasing percentage of a library's budget. You want to check out technology? get a library card. You need internet access because you are one of the WAY TOO MANY underserved and marginalized persons in America? Go to the library. You need a safe place to learn about yourself, LGBT teen? Come to the library. You need to learn English to get a job? Come to the library. You need to close libraries because you have no idea what the fuck they do? Stay the fuck home and shut your mouth. Just kidding, everyone is welcome at the library, even the backwards thinking simpletons who want to cut our budgets. I could go on and on about what libraries do in the 21st century, but I'm too fucking steamed, so if you want to know, ask. More than 100 people responded to Halpern’s tweets, praising his comments and sharing their support for libraries. So, the Angriest Librarian was happy again.  I am heartened by the number of people who love their library. I am now less mad online. A friendly message to all my new followers: go get yourself a fucking library card. But then, Walker doubled down on his initial claim.  I know this makes Librarians angry but shutting libraries and putting the books into schools would be an absolute good. https://t.co/AEy4X0iAAx This fucking guy is still going https://t.co/jDXVnrqX3w Librarians are like French teachers. These jobs exist in order to pay the wages of sad people who can't get proper work. Imagine being this guy https://t.co/sxbShhkARL After receiving a flood of responses, Walker walked back his original comments. Dear #Library users, I surrender! pic.twitter.com/1F0cog6xo0 As for Halpern, he now has thousands of new library-loving followers: Library twitter is lit af this week get on board The 6000 of you who followed me in the last day are going to be very disappointed when I return to tweeting about star wars and baseball"
POLITICS,"By Sophie Quinton   BALTIMORE — When the man in the teal hoodie mentioned that he had trained as a pharmacy technician, Lachelle Hill’s voice rose in excitement. “Why don’t I see that on here?” the state job counselor asked, pointing at the paperwork on the table between them. Hill was counseling Corey, a 30-year-old jobseeker who didn’t share his last name, at a federally funded job center here on the top floor of a shopping mall, an escalator ride away from a Forever 21 and a Cinnabon. Unemployment insurance beneficiaries are required to look for work, but Hill wasn’t just checking Corey’s paperwork for compliance. She was helping him focus his job search, and trying to steer him toward positions he was qualified for. Such conversations are central to a reemployment grant program that the U.S. Department of Labor has touted for years. In February, Congress passed a budget bill that would make the program permanent and increase its funding from about $100 million last year to more than $3 billion over the next six years. To push states to improve their programs further, the law requires that starting in 2023 states must spend a quarter of their money on “evidence-based interventions” that have been proven to get people jobs faster. But creating evidence-based employment programs can be tricky. While research generally shows that employment assistance helps people get jobs, it’s not always clear why certain programs work well and whether they can be expanded. The nationwide employment program that Corey’s benefiting from is based on a Nevada model that significantly reduced the amount of time people received unemployment benefits. Studies have yet to determine whether the Nevada approach can get the same results elsewhere. State workforce and unemployment insurance officials are now waiting for the Labor Department to clarify its definition of “evidence-based.” “We’re all waiting on pins and needles,” said Michelle Meader, who operates Washington state’s version of the employment program. Back at the job center, Corey said he’d been looking for jobs on roadwork crews and at the seaport, and talking to a friend about starting a day labor business. Hill zeroed in on the brightest spot on his resume: his pharmacy training, which could net him wages of about $15 an hour in the area. “Sometimes, people crash because they aim too low,” Hill said. Corey explained that his pharmacy technician license had expired, but Hill didn’t bat an eye. “Let’s look into the recertification, and see if we can get you the funds to do that.”   Success in Nevada The current federal reemployment program began as a grant with a slightly different focus called Reemployment and Eligibility Assessment, or REA. The first $18 million was split between 20 states in 2005. States used the money to require some unemployment insurance claimants to go to a career center for an interview. Staff members would check that the claimant was actively searching for work, share labor market information, and make sure they had a job search plan. The program was designed to uncover idlers who weren’t looking for work — and thus weren’t eligible for benefits — and to help participants get jobs faster. A 2011 Labor Department-funded study of the REA program in Florida, Idaho, Illinois and Nevada found that, on average, participants reduced their time receiving benefits by over a week compared with a control group. The Nevada program had the best results: It cut time receiving benefits by almost three weeks, saving $805 in payments on average. For every dollar spent on administering the program four were saved on unemployment benefits, according to the study conducted by IMPAQ International, a research and evaluation firm in Bethesda, Maryland. The researchers said Nevada’s program may have been successful because it used the same staff to conduct eligibility checks, help claimants make job search plans, and also — thanks to a separate federal grant — connected participants with more career services. Claimants felt like the job counselors were there to help them, not put them through a compliance exercise, said Lynda Parven, deputy administrator of the Employment Security Division at the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation. “Most people saw it not as a stick, but as a carrot.” The Labor Department restructured the grant requirements in 2015 to reflect Nevada’s model. The program now emphasizes job assistance targeted to a claimant’s needs and requires staff to refer participants to at least one other career service, such as a resume workshop at a job center. The employment program is now active in almost every state. But while the prior version of the grant required states to randomly select participants, the current version selects participants from higher-need populations, such as discharged veterans and people likely to struggle to find a job. States use algorithms to determine who falls into the latter group. But Can It Be Repeated? The Labor Department has long held up the Nevada results as a success story. In last year’s budget request, for instance, the agency called the reemployment program “a proven activity that saves an average of $536 per claimant.” The figure is seemingly taken from a 2012 study of the Nevada REA program, also by IMPAQ International. But researchers still are not sure what caused Nevada’s program to work so well, if it can be replicated, or if the current version of the program delivers the same results. The lack of clarity is true of many programs that help get people back to work. “A lot of the evidence on these interventions has been kind of at a black box level,” said Yvette Chocolaad, policy director for the National Association of State Workforce Agencies, at a recent Urban Institute event. While the overall outcome may be good, it may not be clear what components of a program make a difference. Employment programs involve many factors. While research highlights a few strategies that work, such as friendly emails and follow-up messages that encourage claimants to come to their appointment at a job center, others are hard to quantify or replicate, such as a program’s leadership.   Jacob Klerman, principal associate of Abt Associates, an evaluation company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is wrapping up a Labor Department study that compares REA programs in multiple states. He wouldn’t remark on the yet-to-be-published findings, but said it wasn’t clear if the Nevada model could be copied. “The results from Nevada are basically twice as large as any other state. So Nevada is an outlier.” As for the current version of the reemployment program, it’s too new to have been subjected to rigorous academic studies. Many state agencies are still crunching the first year of data on, for instance, whether the new model has decreased the amount of time people spend receiving benefits. Maryland’s data so far, collected by the unemployment insurance office, shows that last year over 18,000 people attended a job services orientation, and almost half as many made it to a follow-up session, such as a resume workshop. The program’s most important element may be the staff. At the job center here in Baltimore, they are a friendly bunch, quick to hand out inspiration. On a recent Friday morning, a receptionist in the lemon-walled reception area urged on a young man with an aphorism: “You’re a go-getter. Good things come to those who wait, but better things come to those who go out and get it.” In a cubicle on the other side of the room, Hill deftly guided reemployment program participants toward services that might help their job search. She asked a recent college graduate laid off from a mortgage company if he was tailoring his resume to every job application, and she suggested he sign up for a resume workshop to get some tips. Then Hill sat down with a young woman with braces and a trendy bob who said she was eager to take any job at all. The woman had previously worked as a security guard and in customer service, and she seemed a little lost and unsure of herself. Hill took a firmer, more motherly approach, registering her for a career aptitude test and an interviewing workshop and encouraging her to come back later for more one-on-one counseling. Hill asked if the woman had access to a computer at home — she didn’t — and told her she was welcome to use the job center’s computers. In the next room, the program manager for the Maryland reemployment program, Kari Pompilli, was also interviewing claimants. “Our goal is to not let them fall into a rut of unemployment,” she said later. If jobseekers confer with someone who listens to them and is optimistic about their search — “That’s half the battle, for some people,” she said.    Stateline home page Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "
ARTS & CULTURE," All great creations begin with a vision. It starts with a spark, a feeling that someday you will create something magnificent. Then that spark ignites into a flame that consumes your thoughts and pushes you ever closer to your goals. Finally, that someday becomes today, and before you know it, your vision has become your reality. Envision Festival in Costa Rica encourages not only the act of dreaming but the act of accomplishing those dreams. Located in Uvita where jungle meets beach, the natural beauty of the festival's surroundings added an element unlike any festival. A cacophony of howler monkeys, tropical birds and cicadas provided an ever-changing soundtrack to an already musically diverse event. The people of Envision were the final ingredient to Envision's divine recipe. Arriving at this festival was no easy task. One does not simply walk into Envision. After hours of flight and waiting, missed buses, long commutes and longer lines, sweltering heat and biting bugs, to finally pass through the Envision entrance, you have not only made it, you have earned it. With four stages of music, each one offered delicious beats for every flavor of human taste. Adorned in palm fronds, The Village was the most intimate with a floor level stage allowing the performers to share the same ground as their audience. The Lotus Stage which was located right by the beach entrance was the only stage with shade and therefore the only stage with daytime music. Henry Pope's infectious beats could be felt from the beach, luring sandy feet onto his shady dancefloor. Artists Tara Brooks, ill-esha, SaQi, Amani and An-Ten-Nae also graced the Lotus with a heavy dose of EDM, bass, crunk, and house. The most consistent stage at the festival, those who needed a quick defibrillation could hit the Lotus and receive a bolt of musical current.
Photo by Max Ryan Then there was the Luna Stage. Standing just over 30 feet tall, the stage's foundation was built of sustainably sourced Costa Rican bamboo. A four-armed jaguar sitting in lotus position constructed completely out of driftwood cradles the DJ booth. The projection screens were hand cut from unsellable plywood with beautifully designed 3D mapping to decorate their surface. Created and conceptualized by Tigre Bailando, Hoodie Salinas, Ari Makridakis, Josh Daniel, Degan Wilcox, and Living Space, the Jaguar Moon Goddess was a blending of cultures, paying homage to the indigenous Boruca people, Hindu deities Lakshmi and Shiva, Buddhist saint Kuan Yin and Egyptian warrior goddess Sekhmet. The Luna Stage hosted artists such as Lulacruza who opened up the festival with primal vocals, shamanic beats, and the magic of the jungle in their hearts. The Polish Ambassador funked us up a notch in his gleaming jumpsuit.  Hedflux followed by AtYyA drenched us in a sticky layer of bass that I didn't want to wash off (and couldn't if I tried). Perkulat0r, Santos y Zurdo, Stylust Beats, Phaeleh, Funk Hunters, Emancipator, Random Rab's famous sunrise set, and so many more tantalized our senses at the Luna Stage. Alongside the prismatic music was a constant rotation of performance artists. Aerial acrobats Amy Raven, Jem Destiny, and Laura Dasi tangled and twirled in an array of dangling apparatuses. Fire dancers Lucas Reshi, Casey McComb, and Rosalia Webster fearlessly manipulated flame, blissfully smiling behind its warm glow. LED and fire hula-hoopers Dylan T. Bradley, Ali Luminescent, and Christine Geiger, defied gravity as illuminated hula hoops orbited around their bodies with perfect control and grace. World dancers Jasmine Fuego and Amy Secada offered an eclectic style with their deeply rhythmic movements. With too many captivating performance artists to name them all, the talent did not end on stage but poured into the crowd. The audience was filled with talented dancers, hoopers, poi spinners, and acrobats. Everyone was a performer, even if no one was watching. The most diverse stage was the Sol Stage. Sol hosted artists such as Ayla Nereo and Wildlight who moved our bodies and minds. Infibeat's Costa Rican disco funk kept hips swiveling and Groundation got us high with a dose of reggae. Luminaries blessed us with their conscious hip hop and enlightening flowetry. Sharing electronic, world, hip hop, reggae and many more genres, the Sol Stage delivered a unique vibe in comparison to Lotus and Luna.  A music festival without art is like a river without stones, it can still flow, but it feels incomplete. Legendary and visionary artists Amanda Sage, Android Jones and Chris Dyer gave onlookers a glimpse into their creative process as well as their psychedelic minds. Lucas Rod, friend and live painter, utilized his surroundings by using plants and trees as his easel. Glass artist Snic Barnes had his intricate pieces on display while a team of live glassblowers shaped molten glass for hypnotized spectators. There was the usual array of delicately handcrafted wares such as wire wrapped stones, all beautiful and luminous. Laser etched crystals, pins, glass bottles and Palo Santo sticks created by Andrea Towns were sold alongside Amanda Sage's clothing line. A variety of workshops and seminars were offered ranging from Rachel Brathen's yoga to Sarah Wu's plant tours. Permaculturist Stephen Brooks, one of the founders of the festival, was constantly active, lending a hand, introducing acts, giving inspirational speeches, while still being kind enough to stop and say hello to those who acknowledged him. All the workers and volunteers gave their time and energy to Envision, and even in the face of struggle, kept a positive outlook.  Envision Festival is where future meets present. Long set times and acts performing twice gives attendees the opportunity to not miss a beat. The sounds of the jungle encompass and empower you as toucans and monkeys fly above. You can splash in the warm ocean or a refreshing waterfall; dance to the pulse of electronic music or sway to the staccato of reggae; drink the elixir of coconuts from the trees above you and slather yourself in blue clay. Bring your own plates and utensils eliminated the waste of single use items. Even compostable toilets were available offering a respite from porta potties. The frequency of coincidences that everyone shared became a reassurance that we have chosen the right path. Full of inspiration, love, and appreciation, we showed up as dreamers and left as Envisionaries.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Candles, yogurt, rosé, and now rompers: Our capitalistic marketplace overflows with desirable, fun products that suffer from their association with women. Fortunately, businesses have found a way to market their goods to both women and men: bro branding. (”Bronding”?) We’ve had mandles, brogurt, brosé, and now the latest example, the RompHim™, a short jumpsuit for men. The RompHim launched via Kickstarter this week and quickly drew derision from Twitter wits. Men in rompers! Imagine! The summer romper, a cute number that typically looks like a sundress with shorts instead of a skirt, has firmly established itself in the past few years as a popular option for women. Though nearly impossible in bathroom contexts (nothing like hovering naked over a public toilet with one’s entire outfit pooled around one’s ankles to induce skepticism of the trend), it’s otherwise quite convenient. Women can have all the flirty style of a short sundress without the fear of stiff winds, bicycling and sitting cross-legged.  Both men and women have rocked jumpsuits before this latest romper bubble, but the sudden popularity of ruffled, floral jumpsuits for women seems to have tainted the style’s gender-neutral reputation. Many of the recent Twitter jibes directed at the garment centered around the absurdity of a man dressing like a woman ― showing up to a date wearing the same romper as his female counterpart, preening himself over his cute new look, etc.  There’s a genuine merit to the RompHim™ approach: Rompers are convenient (probably even more so for men, who will be able to pee in a romper without disrobing), and they’ve become ubiquitous in women’s fashion but not men’s. But it’s infuriating that advertisers have come to rely on artificial layers of masculinization to convince men to buy products that should be gender-neutral.  Pink wine? That’s girl stuff. Brosé, though, that’s something for bros. Yogurt is something ladies in grey hoodies eat to maintain their svelte figures in between mothering and wifing, but brogurt is powerful, protein-packed nourishment for men. Scented candles are chick tchotchkes, but a mandle redolent of freshly mown football fields is perfect for your man cave. The products are marketed directly at men who actually want scented candles, rompers and rosé, but who fear their very masculinity will come into question if they indulge. Even as feminists chip away at the socially constructed gender roles that men and women have long felt obligated to perform, male anxiety seems more pervasive than ever. While women feel empowered to lean in to male roles ― and styles ― men battle internal and external pressure to protect a male-only space that distinguishes them from the “weaker” sex. Women today wear pants, Oxford shoes and shirts, and menswear-inspired everything; it’s still rare to see a man in a skirt, and many even find men in shorts to be laughable. Our conception of what men can wear remains as narrow as it was 50 years ago, if not more so.  her: romperhim: ROMPHIMher: shirthim: SHIMTher: pantshim: MANTSher: waterhim: BROATER.. FOR MEN In the past, activists have mocked the pinkification of products to appeal to women ― perhaps most hilariously, Bic for Her ballpoint pens ― but apparently when women buy basic, mainstream products, men become embarrassed to consume the same things. It’s not too hard to get women to buy gender-neutral items (or even male-coded ones: think of the popularity of “boyfriend” jeans). After all, liking and using things men like and use can result in higher status for women. Drink whiskey, watch football, down a plateful of wings ― as long as you’re hot, you’re the perfect woman, and even if you’re not a solid nine, your choices will at least be deemed respectable. It’s men who nurture the more acute anxiety about gender neutrality. (This makes sense; in a world divided neatly into men and women, men have almost uniformly gleaned the advantages from this demarcation.) A man watching “Real Housewives” with a glass of zinfandel in a romper is flouting gender norms, but by adopting the lesser-respected female-coded habits. His wine and outfit need to be placed in a separate, more macho category than the identical versions consumed by women. “Don’t worry,” says a carton emblazoned with the name Powerful Yogurt, “just because you’re eating yogurt like a lady doesn’t mean you’re effeminate! You’re still the man here.” A 2016 follow-up on brogurt noted that brands like Powerful Yogurt were going “gender-neutral”: “[Excluding women] was a risk,” said one executive of their male-focused advertising. Was it, though? Women have always been OK buying products coded as male ― even as men run screaming from anything pink or cute. RompHim suggests their men’s cut rompers as a good option for women who prefer a unisex silhouette; the reverse of that two-birds-one-stone approach would never work out.  The veritable rash of bro-ified terms for non-gendered products shows how deep male fragility runs: A man’s manhood requires constant signaling and buttressing to remain secure. Men who step out of line are derided as emasculated and sexually confused. For men to reap the benefits of a gender-neutral world, we rely on verbal tricks that only reinforce the gender-normative stereotypes that keep men boxed in. The real progress will be made when men can drink rosé in a romper without a single batted eyelash or “bro” prefix."
ARTS & CULTURE,"George Lucas is well known for his love of Wookiees, droids, Stormtroopers and interstellar cantina scenes. He’s less known for his love of Norman Rockwell paintings and R. Crumb comics. But according to The New York Times, we should probably get used to associating Lucas with the finer aspects of the art world, rather than just the intricacies of hairy humanoids from planet Kashyyyk. Why? Because the “Star Wars” creator is about to open a giant museum in Los Angeles that will house 10,000 paintings along with book and magazine illustrations. After years of planning, the museum’s board of directors announced on Tuesday that the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art will be built in Los Angeles at a cost of $1 billion. After previous attempts to place his vision in Chicago and San Francisco ― both of which were met with some opposition ― the filmmaker has decided to open the Lucas Museum near the coastal city’s Exposition Park, a popular spot for art institutions. ”This is the first museum of its kind, with an unprecedented collection that features fine art and popular art from illustration to comics, an insider’s perspective on the cinematic creative process and the boundless potential of the digital medium,” reads a statement on the museum’s website. It continues: The Lucas Museum will be a barrier free museum where artificial divisions between “high” art and “popular” art are absent, allowing you to explore a wide array of compelling visual storytelling. Visitors who might be less inclined to visit a traditional fine art museum will be invited to engage with and relate to art forms they recognize and love. The collection includes works by Edgar Degas, Winslow Homer and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, as well as illustrations, children’s art, comic art and photography from various periods. It will be housed in what’s been described by various press outlets as a “futuristic-looking” museum. Is it surprising that a Hollywood icon like Lucas would want to open a museum dedicated to both “high” and “popular” art? Probably not. After all, famous cultural critic Camille Paglia once dubbed him “the greatest artist of our time.”  And yes, “Star Wars” fans, there will be some objects from your favorite galactic epic in the museum mix, too."
BUSINESS,"American Apparel is going Canadian. The embattled clothing company is closing all of its retail stores and Los Angeles headquarters after its purchase last week by Montreal-based company Gildan Activewear, The Los Angeles Times reported. All 110 American Apparel stores will close by the end of April, with as many as 3,400 employees expected to lose their jobs. The sale follows the once popular retailer ― whose logo was “Made in America – Sweatshop Free” ― filing for bankruptcy in 2015 and again last November. “This was always about buying assets out of bankruptcy,” Gildan spokesman Garry Bell told the Times. “The reality is this wasn’t a purchase of an ongoing concern.” Gildan, whose brands include GoldToe socks and Anvil, has factories in Central America, the Caribbean, Bangladesh and the U.S., according to the company’s website. Currently, the only finished goods produced in the U.S. are socks, the Times reported. Though the American Apparel brand will reportedly live on, it’s expected to be far different than it is today. Analysts speaking to The Times forecast that the company likely will not keep its manufacturing operations in California, especially with the state planning to raise the minimum wage. Because Gildan’s clothing is sold through other retailers, the Times suggested that any future American Apparel items will be found in chain stores, like Kmart or Target, or through other wholesale buyers. The company’s sale comes two years after its controversial Canadian-born founder, Dov Charney, was ousted in 2014 following allegations of sexual misconduct and misuse of company funds. Today he is working on a new business, according to his website, that showcases an ongoing photography project titled “That’s Los Angeles.”"
ARTS & CULTURE," By Justin Quirk, June 19, 2015 It seems to be an unofficial rule of the modern art fair that sooner or later they are obliged to transcend their creative and physical boundaries and expand beyond their original brief and location. Frieze London has had its sculpture park; Frieze New York's sonic art selection, Frieze Sounds presented artists work in the VIP cars that moved guests around the city, and Venice burst its banks some time ago with apparently every space in the city now accommodating off-site artwork during the Biennale. Arguably the first to start this trend was Art Basel's supplementary platform, Unlimited, a showcase ""for artworks that transcend the traditional art-fair stand"" that now runs alongside the main Basel experience. This year's Unlimited is curated for the fourth year by Gianni Jetzer (of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington DC), and will host 74 contributions from participating galleries. The idea of Unlimited is that galleries can present work that won't physically fit within the confines of the regular Basel booths: large-scale sculptures, video projections, site-specific pieces, performance art and installations are all included. The list of contributing artists is impressively blue-chip and includes Ai Weiwei, Martin Creed, Olafur Eliasson, Pierre Huyghe, Pedro Reyes, Dan Flavin, Gilbert & George, Ryan McGinley, Sarah Morris and Kenneth Anger. Stand-out pieces include: Weiwei's ""Stacked"" (2012), created from 760 of his Chinese Forever bicycles; Reyes' ""Disarm"" (Mechanized) II (2014), part of his international project in which confiscated guns are transformed into musical instruments; Eliasson's light-based ""Your Space Embracer"" (2004); and David Shrigley's ""Life Model"" (2012), a work first seen in Britain's Turner Prize and comprising of a three-meter high sculpture figure which is being drawn by visitors to the gallery. Alongside these pieces will be Julius von Bismarck's ""Egocentric System"" (2015) a live performance taking place across the entirety of the show, and Rio art collective OPAVIVARÅ's ""Formosa Decelerator,"" which allows visitors to lounge in hammocks and blend their own tea. In reality, Unlimited is no longer a subsidiary part of the main Basel fair, but an equal partner - it just got too big for its booths.

For the full gallery list for Unlimited, visit artbasel.com. Art Basel runs through June 21. This year, 284 galleries from 33 countries will present works ranging from the modern period of the early 20th century to the most contemporary artists of today.

Photo by Gabe Palacio By Mark McLaren, ZEALnyc Editor in Chief, July 15, 2016 Let's talk about Caramoor. I have spent many a night lying on the lawn of Tanglewood, the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, swilling white wine under a starry Berkshire's sky and listening to world-class music. Like any good New Englander, change does not come easily and I didn't imagine that this experience could be replicated - anywhere. That is until I discovered Caramoor. Come to find out, New Yorkers don't have to travel three hours for an idyllic combination of music, setting, and stars. Caramoor, New York's premier summer music festival, offers everything that is enjoyed at Tanglewood - world-class music with some of the world's leading performers, a stunning physical environment, and of course, beautiful night skies - and all without the Berkshires commute. Caramoor Music Festival (with programming this summer from mid-June through the end of August) resides at the historic Westchester Rosen estate in Katonah, NY, just sixty minutes (fifty miles) from Manhattan by car or public transportation. This short commute offers a thrilling payoff.
Soprano Georgia Jarman sings Zenobia in Rossini's Aureliano in Palmira, Photo provided by Caramoor. Caramoor is the summer home of New York City's Orchestra of St. Luke's, which anchors much of its programming. It also hosts the Bel Canto Young Artists program, and in conjunction with these two institutions, this weekend Caramoor presents an exciting production of Rossini's rarely-performed work Aureliano in Palmira. Tenor Andrew Owens and sopranos Georgia Jarman and  Tamara Mumford (who appears at the Met this season in Anna Bolena) sing in this early Rossini work that has been rarely heard since its 1813 La Scalla premier. Caramoor's Director of Opera Will Crutchfield has been instrumental in reassembling the score which was 'shred' by the composer after its initial rocky debut. This is a fine cast in a performance of a lost bel canto work that could enter the standard repertoire of opera houses. Go to Caramoor and be the first to rediscover.
Pacifica Quartet, Photo provided by Caramoor. Also at Carmoor next week, Pacifica Quartet returns with an interesting chamber music program that includes two Beethoven works and a piece by Shulamit Ran, String Quartet No. 3: Glitter, Shards, Doom, Memory.

POLITICS,"Prodded by Democrats, the Senate is set late next week to vote on what could be the first step toward restoring net neutrality rules. The Federal Communications Commission repealed the protections in December despite widespread public opposition and a request from 18 state attorneys general to delay the action over concerns that the comment process was corrupted by fraudulent messages. The repeal effort was led by Ajit Pai, who President Donald Trump appointed to chair the FCC. A petition filed by Senate Democrats on Wednesday will force the net neutrality vote in the chamber, where it has a good chance of passing, perhaps as narrowly as 50-49. According to Reuters, all of the chamber’s 47 Democrats, the two independents who caucus with the party and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) are expected to support the measure. That would outvote the remaining Republican senators, who are down one vote as Sen. John McCain of Arizona remains on medical absence. Potentially, other moderate Republicans could join Collins and back the effort. Clearing the Senate hurdle likely is the easy part. The measure would then go to the House, where Republicans have a larger majority. And if it passes the House, the legislation would still need Trump’s signature ― no sure thing, given that he put Pai in the position to lead the push overturning the Obama-era net neutrality rules. The FCC’s repeal rolled back so-called “Title II” regulations that classified the internet as a public utility and which, among other things, required internet service providers (ISPs) to treat all of the data traveling on their networks equally. Absent those protections, ISPs such as AT&T, Comcast and Verizon (which owns HuffPost’s parent company, Oath) could prioritize their own content at the expense of others. (HuffPost’s union is represented by the Writers Guild of America, East, which supports net neutrality and opposed its repeal.) Battle For The Net, a net neutrality advocacy group, is organizing demonstrations in support of the Senate effort on Monday. And many of its members ― including websites like Reddit, Tinder, Tumblr and Wikimedia ― began running “red alert” banners on Wednesday to raise awareness on the issue.  “Net Neutrality is overwhelmingly supported by people across the political spectrum: Republicans, Democrats, and independents alike,” Craig Aaron, head of the pro net-neutrality advocacy group Free Press Action Fund, said in an emailed statement. “Congress has the chance to rewind a terrible Trump administration policy decision, and one of its least popular, too,” he said. “The public will be closely watching who’s looking out for them and who’s only serving phone and cable lobbyists.”"
BUSINESS,"However much you tip your Uber driver, it’s probably not enough. And however much Uber pays its drivers, it’s almost definitely not enough, either. Those are two big takeaways from a new working paper by a group of researchers led by Stephen Zoepf, executive director of the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford University and a researcher at the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, which found that a substantial percentage of drivers for ride-hailing companies probably earn less than they think they do, though their wages are padded thanks to per-mile tax deductions. As a working paper, it’s important to note the figures haven’t been peer-reviewed and are subject to change. Nevertheless, it offers interesting insight into an industry where driver pay has been the subject of much scrutiny. Unlike previous economic analyses that report drivers’ gross profits without factoring in operational costs, the MIT paper takes into account how much drivers spend on things like insurance, maintenance, repairs, fuel and the car’s depreciation in value, using data from Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book and the Environmental Protection Agency.  Once those costs are accounted for, the working paper found, 74 percent of ride-hailing drivers make less than the minimum wage in their states, and 30 percent of drivers actually lose money for every mile they drive. In the survey of 1,121 drivers, the median driver earned $0.59 per mile and paid out $0.30 per mile in vehicle costs, leading to a median hourly profit of $3.37.  Notably, a choice few drivers with the most efficient vehicles and running the most profitable routes were able to turn out revenue of $1.50 per mile. Zoepf told HuffPost the Toyota Prius, a gas/electric hybrid, was drivers’ vehicle of choice by a factor of two. More than 80 percent of the drivers surveyed said they work less than 40 hours per week. It isn’t all bad news for drivers, however. The paper found nearly half of all drivers can declare a loss for tax purposes at the federal tax deduction rate of roughly $0.54 per mile. Per the researchers, that drastically decreases the amount of taxable income drivers need to report, to the extent that an estimated 74 percent of driver profit ― representing billions of dollars ― is going untaxed. “At an average of $661/month in net profit per driver and with hundreds of thousands of drivers in the U.S. alone, the standard mileage deduction facilitates billions of dollars of untaxed income, and hundreds of millions of unrealized tax revenue,” the paper notes. “This untaxed profit represents a social subsidy for the ride-hailing business model.” Lyft didn’t respond to a request for comment from HuffPost, but a spokesman for Uber vigorously disputed the paper’s methodology and findings. “While the paper is certainly attention grabbing, its methodology and findings are deeply flawed,” the spokesman said. “We’ve reached out to the paper’s authors to share our concerns and suggest ways we might work together to refine their approach.” Zoepf didn’t immediately respond to followup questions about his methodology. Compared to other studies that used different methodology, the MIT paper is indeed an outlier. A National Bureau of Economic Research study in November 2016 found drivers in six major metropolitan areas earned around $18 an hour, not taking into account hourly costs varying from $2.94 to $6.46 per hour depending on the hours they worked and the vehicle they drove. The paper also received some scrutiny from Harry Campbell, founder of The Rideshare Guy, an industry blog. Campbell’s 2017 Reader Survey provided the hard data the researchers used for their paper. Using the same data, Campbell came up with an average hourly rate of around $16 an hour, not taking drivers’ operational costs into account. But, he said, even if MIT’s methodology needs to be tweaked ― which is possible, since it’s a working paper ―  its fundamental finding is spot on: Drivers aren’t making enough money.  “Many drivers are doing this job part time and really only looking to make a few hundred bucks a week,” Campbell said, “but figuring out how much they are actually earning can be quite challenging.  “I think that’s why we see such high turnover, and the No. 1 reason we hear from drivers as to why they’re quitting is because of lower-than-expected earnings.”"
ENTERTAINMENT,"This time he took home the gold ― or whatever’s in the Mirrorball Trophy. Adam Rippon, a bronze medalist figure skater at the Winter Olympics, won the “Dancing with the Stars” athletes-only competition on Monday with partner Jenna Johnson. “The Mirrorball has now taken on a new meaning, someone like me is accepted and I feel loved,” Rippon, the first openly gay athlete to compete for the United States at the Winter Games, said before his last dance, according to People magazine. Rippon and Johnson got a perfect score for a jazz routine to “Anything You Can Do” on their first performance:  Then they earned 28 out of 30 for a freestyle to “Scooby Doo Pa Pa”:  Football player Josh Norman and Shana Burgess finished second, and Tonya Harding and Sasha Farber were third. Rippon said the trophy would go right next to his bronze medal, which he won in the team event in South Korea. Rippon appeared to be the Mirrorball favorite from the very first show, when he and Johnson aced a vogue-ing cha cha to “Sissy That Walk.” “You were born to do this show,” panelist Carrie Ann Inaba told Rippon at the time. Now he’s the winner. “This has just been such an incredible experience,” Rippon said after his victory in the clip at the top."

Irish Band Moxie. Photo by Colin Gillen. Courtesy Moxie. Before Irish-American Heritage Month ends, I should mention some recent albums and activities with Irish connections. My own onstage activities on St. Patrick's Day were unusually well publicized this year: as part of bagpipe superstar Carlos Núñez's concert at Washington's Strathmore Music Center, I recited a translation of an Old Irish poem while Carlos played a beautiful air on the whistle. The point was to highlight the ancient connections between Ireland and Spain, an idea that got some traction in both the U.S. media and the Spanish press. (You can watch a whole Carlos Núñez concert with some singing and reciting by me at my previous post, here.) But I mostly wanted to highlight other Irish connections waiting among the CDs on my review shelf. I'll begin with Spinning Yarns, the brand-new solo CD from Norah Rendell, a former member of the international Irish band The Outside Track and a current member of Twin Cities band Two Tap Trio. Her goal for the CD was to ""feature the songs of Canadian singers of Irish, Scottish, and English descent for whom old songs provided connection to memories of special times, people, and places."" To accomplish this, she did extensive research into archival collections and found some truly lovely texts and melodies. The star source singer of the album turns out to be Angelo Dornan, a New Brunswick singer recorded by Helen Creighton in the 1950s (hear his singing here). Dornan's repertoire included a lot of terrific and unusual songs, including the album's opener, ""Letty Lee,"" which details the courtship of two unusually eloquent and witty lovers. Rendell sings three more of Dornan's songs, and also mines collections by MacEdward Leach (Newfoundland), W. Roy MacKenzie (Nova Scotia), Edith Fowke (Ontario), Sidney Robertson Cowell (Wisconsin), and Franz Rickaby (Wisconsin). While paying all due respect to the sources, Rendell wasn't afraid to combine elements of her favorite versions, adhering to her strong personal vision of Canadian (and sometimes American) tradition, based solidly in old-world folksongs.
Norah Rendell.  Courtesy Norah Rendell. Like Carlos Núñez, Rendell was an early music recorder major at university before becoming a Celtic musician, and this must have helped her ear for arrangements and her skills on flute and whistle, which add to the impressive talents on the disc. Using these skills, she took her newly-polished gems and set them in arrangements featuring guitar and bouzouki from her husband Brian Miller, guitar and mandola from Randy Gosa, Celtic harp from Ailie Robertson, and her own flutes, whistles, and harmonium. This work has everything: traditional songs I can't remember hearing before (""When I Wake in the Morning,"" ""St. Patrick's Day""), unusual versions of favorites (""Here's a Health Unto All True Lovers,"" ""Carrion Crow""), sparkling arrangements that complement each song, and thoughtfully written notes that honor the source singers, collectors, and musicians. And I haven't even mentioned her clear, expressive singing, which is among the best on today's Celtic folk scene. It all adds up to a brilliant album I could listen to all day--in fact, I just have! Rendell promises more videos soon, but for now she's provided the one below. Speaking of Canada, Irish may not be the first thing people think of when you say Québec, but in fact Irish music is one of the major ingredients in the melting pot of Québec folk music. While the older songs are mostly from France, tunes and playing styles are, broadly speaking, more Irish than French. So let's talk about Les Vents Qui Ventent, the second album from the trio Le Bruit Court Dans La Ville, a great collection of French-Canadian folk music played by a seasoned trio. André Marchand has for a long time been a godfather figure in Québec folk music, as a founder of the province's most successful folk band (La Bottine Souriante), as well as a producer, organizer, arranger, engineer, and (of course) singer and guitarist on hundreds of projects. Lisa Ornstein, the band's token American, was an old-time fiddler before apprenticing with Louis 'Pitou' Boudreault and becoming adept at Québec fiddling; along the way she's become a masterful arranger as well. Normand Miron learned songs, accordion tunes, and great harmonica style in his home region of Lanaudière, considered the taproot of Québec music. Together and separately, they have helped to define Québec folk music for their generation and for the youngsters who have followed them.
Le Bruit Court Dans La Ville.  Courtesy Lisa Ornstein. Their approach is now standard for Québec bands: take some repertoire that is purely local, songs you learned from your family or from neighbors. Do research in archival collections for other unusual tunes and songs. Write a few pieces yourself. Then sit down and arrange and play them, using ideas from Québec's root traditions, from the folk revival, from Irish music, and from your own brain. If your brains are as fertile, your chops as impressive, your research skills as sharp, and your neighbors as cool as these folks', you can end up with something pretty special. Les Vents Qui Ventent features French ballads, fiddle and accordion tunes, and beautifully sung ""turluttes,"" or mouth music, all tied together by one of the iconic sounds of Québec: André Marchand's tapping feet. Standout pieces include the opener, a song about a sorceress who seduces the king's daughter's beloved; ""Le Coucou,"" a comic song about a husband's revenge on his cheating wife; and ""Le Départ du Canada,"" a genuinely moving Acadian song about the horrors endured by Canadians who move to the U.S. (It doesn't mention health insurance!)  Two of the best tracks really highlight the Irish connections. ""Marie Roret"" is a lovely French-language pastoral that seems to have originated as a French translation of the popular Anglo-Irish song ""Seventeen Come Sunday."" It's interwoven on the album with an Acadian lilt, which, when layered with the song's lyrics, lends it an almost medieval feeling--a great example of the band's innovative arranging. ""The Foxhunter's Jig/L'Arachouidine"" is a rousing set of two fiddle tunes; the first came to Québec from Ireland, while the second is an adaptation of the first from the Gaspé Peninsula. Amusingly, the tune title the band heard as ""L'Arachouidine"" turned out to be their source's attempt to say ""The Irish Wedding."" There's a video below--and see these videos and more at their website. Like the folk musics of Spain and North America, the music of Wales has a long and deep connection with that of Ireland; from the bardic schools of the middle ages, which sent harpers and singers between them, to today's folk revival, the two countries have influenced each other unceasingly for centuries. So it's not a surprise to find both Welsh-language and Anglo-Irish songs on Dacw'r Tannau, the latest album from Welsh folksinger Chris Jones. I met Jones and got his album at the International Folk Alliance conference a few weeks ago, but didn't get a chance to hear him perform. Now I regret missing him, because Dacw'r Tannau reveals a warm, accessible voice and impressive self-accompaniment on guitar and bouzouki. He lists Dick Gaughan, Nic Jones, Christy Moore, and Meic Stevens as influences, but the voice I hear most in his singing is the great Glasgow singer Archie Fisher; if Archie had grown up in Caernarfon, he'd sound a lot like Jones. The album boasts a fun repertoire of favorites in Welsh and English. Folk fans will probably recognize such songs as ""The Next Market Day,"" ""The Fair Flower of Northumberland,"" ""Willie O' Winsbury,"" and ""Sam Hall,"" all of which are given lovely, nuanced treatments; see the video below for a nice one. Jones's talents also apply beautifully to the Welsh-language material, which is no surprise; he began his career as an unaccompanied Welsh folksinger. The Welsh selections include songs I didn't know and ones I've heard from folks like Linda Griffiths and Siwsann George. After hearing Jones do them, they're all old favorites--watch one below. In short, Dacw'r Tannau is a great pleasure to hear, and I recommend it highly. Which brings me to the one Irish band I'll mention here, Moxie. Their all-instrumental album Planted combines Irish traditional music with lots of other influences, including (mostly) bluegrass and jazz. Indeed, there are tracks on the album, like ""Liberty,"" which are essentially tuneful jazz played on accordion and banjo, with nuanced percussion and subtle bass underpinning them, while guitar and keys add unusual harmonies. There are other tunes where an essentially modern jazz piece will give way to an Irish polka for a while, then slip back into more exploratory sounds. Some, like ""Death of the Den,"" have enough catchy swing to be pop, but with a subtle folk-tune melody. Only a couple of pieces, such as ""Black Widow,"" approach pure Irish traditional music, but they make it clear that these guys have the chops for that too. It's a good listen start to finish, a powerful musical brew that defies categories, suggesting a lot of possibilities for the future of Irish music.  Check out the title track below!"

ENTERTAINMENT,"Kim Kardashian is reportedly working with Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump in an effort to pardon a 62-year-old great-grandmother serving a life sentence for nonviolent drug-related offenses. In 1993, Alice Marie Johnson was arrested and in 1997 was convicted of drug conspiracy and money laundering, according to a Mic profile, which says she became involved with cocaine dealers after a series of deeply unfortunate events: She went through a divorce, she lost her job, she filed for bankruptcy, her home was foreclosed on, and one of her sons was killed. Although they were first-time, nonviolent offenses, she was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Johnson became an ordained minister in prison and has mentored and tutored other inmates. “It feels like I am sitting on death row. Unless things change, I will never go home alive,” she told the ACLU in 2013. Kardashian got involved after sharing a Mic video in October that detailed Johnson’s case: This is so unfair... https://t.co/W3lPINbQuy A representative for Kardashian told Mic that she has since “been in communication with the White House and is working to bring Johnson’s case to the president’s desk.” TMZ corroborated that report, saying Kardashian has gotten her personal attorney Shawn Holley involved and has been working with Kushner and Trump for months on the issue.  Johnson hoped to receive clemency in 2015, when President Barack Obama granted dozens of federal inmates their freedom. She told HuffPost at the time, “I did do something wrong. But this [was] a bad choice in my life that has cost me my life.” She wrote a thank-you note to Kardashian for her efforts and expressed “deep and heartfelt gratitude.” “Ms. Kardashian you are literally helping to save my life and restore me to my family. I was drowning and you have thrown me a life jacket and given me hope,” Johnson wrote in the letter, obtained by TMZ. Johnson remains incarcerated at the Aliceville federal correction institution in Alabama."

ARTS & CULTURE,"Eataly, the fancy Italian market chain fronted by chef Mario Batali, is down to protect a good Italian meal in need. The famed eatery recently announced its plan to back an innovative air-filtration system meant to conserve Leonardo da Vinci’s iconic 15th-century painting “The Last Supper,” which depicts what is possibly the most epic Italian meal of all time. Da Vinci’s tempera-on-gesso masterpiece, depicting Jesus and his disciples deciding to sit on only one side of the dinner table, has been in a steady state of decline since its creation in 1498. The artist’s experimental construction method ― not to mention the fact that the work was once stored in a prison ― contribute to its rapid fading, which is aggravated by the “microscopic dust” of the visitors who make the pilgrimage to see it at Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. As of now, restoration attempts have been largely unsuccessful, and only 1,300 visitors are allowed to see the work each day in order to limit the dust-induced damage.  According to an Eataly spokesperson, Italy’s Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism has developed a system designed to protect this invaluable relic of Italian culture, and Eataly has graciously agreed to help foot the bill. Italian research institutes ISCR, CNR, the Polytechnic Institute of Milan and the University of Milano at Bicocca have teamed up to create a mechanism that will filter in around 10,000 cubic meters of clean air into the convent where the work is housed. That’s almost three times the current amount of sweet, un-dusty air coming in at present. The system aims to protect da Vinci’s work for the next 500 years, Eataly wrote in an email to The Huffington Post, meaning that all of your potential great-great-great-grandkids will get to see Judas, Peter and good ol’ Bartholomew in the flesh ― or, at least, in the paint. The installation is slated for completion by 2019, which also marks the 500th anniversary of da Vinci’s death.  If you’ve previously felt irked by Eataly’s high prices, know the profit from that $9 bag of pasta is going to a great place."

Vox had been given a second chance after not making the cut on Sunday ― and made the most of it, according to the judges. “I do think we know talent when we see it,” Perry said after the performance. “So I say we would like to make an executive decision right now.” Perry pointed to the area where the Top 10 qualifiers were, and gestured for Vox to move over there. “Enough was enough and you put your foot down when it’s real,” Perry later told reporters, per People. “We stand for truth and for justice.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,"Those who are familiar with New York’s Strand Book Store can likely recall its slogan: “18 miles of books.” It’s right there on the store’s ubiquitous red oval logo, seen citywide on tote bags carried by well-read locals and tourists alike. But today, the 90-year-old Manhattan institution selling new and used books boasts closer to 23 miles of the printed word. (It’s measured, by the way, by book spines, exactly how they sit on the shelf.)  “I think 18 miles has such a nice ring to it,” senior designer Topher MacDonald said, recalling an old store awning that originally read “8 miles of books.” Eventually, “somebody tacked a 1 on top of it because [the store] had gotten too big,” he added. However long the Strand’s stock is, the phrase is beautifully evocative. For a book lover catching sight of the slogan on a tote ambling around Central Park, it conjures images of never-ending stacks, more stories and curious plots than can be devoured in a lifetime.  Indeed, it’s the humble canvas tote, first sold at the Strand in the 1980s, that allows a bibliophile on-the-go to subtly transmit that image — and an image of themselves, too.  Current store co-owner Nancy Bass Wyden — the granddaughter of store founder Ben Bass — told HuffPost that the first iteration of the Strand tote was designed by a former longtime floor manager named Richard Devereaux. It had simple block letters, spelling out the store’s name, address and phone number on canvas. That design persisted until the ’90s, when the bookstore’s now-famous red oval logo replaced it. The newer design, attributed to another floor manager’s girlfriend at the time, features the bookstore’s name in Strand Gothic (the store’s own font). The initial tote was relatively small; it held only two or three books at a time. But it grew, and the designs became more varied, as the Strand began ramping up its merchandise section around 2012. “My dad [Fred Bass] kind of resisted for many years. You know, ‘What are you doing to this place?! We should just have serious books!’” Bass Wyden said. He came around to the idea, she said, because it pleased customers. “That was, and is, the most important thing to him,” she said. The Strand has now offered over 100 original tote designs, ranging from political to whimsical. Walking around the store, you can spot canvas homages to Frida Kahlo and Michelle Obama laid out on tables, or get lost in an intricate hand-drawn city scene printed on a bag. There are totes with useful additions like zippers or small phone-sized pockets. Books and tote bags go together naturally — one is an object to be carried, the other carries it. So it makes sense that Strand customers would gravitate toward the bookstore’s bags.  The appeal of a tote, however, goes beyond mere utility. On the surface, any Strand tote signals that its owner enjoys books. Perhaps the owner would also like to be seen supporting independent bookstores — an ever-more-political stance as Amazon and its ilk cast a long shadow over small businesses. Perhaps they have a connection to New York City; whether they live there, visit there, or know someone who visits there, they proudly flaunt the affiliation. Once you start looking, it’s easy to spot a Strand tote or three on an average crowded subway. Their sheer ubiquity means the bags inevitably lose a factor or two of cool. In 2011, Vol. 1 Brooklyn riffed on the associations begotten by various literary totes, suggesting the typical Strand tote owner “probably [doesn’t] actually live in New York. Either that, or you’re a freshman at NYU.” Still, for lit lovers who are unconcerned with urban cachet, there are plenty of options. Customers can buy a bag to communicate even more specific facts about themselves: I love cats. I am a feminist. Shakespeare is my personal superhero. I will not f**k someone who doesn’t own any books. “We know that people that love books, love cats,” Bass Wyden said, reiterating a likely facet of many habitual readers’ personalities: They enjoy the indoors. “We always try to keep that in mind, you know: cozy, fireplace, coffee, tea.” Hand-drawn designs — a trend seen popping up on book covers themselves ― have also proved popular, which Bass Wyden suggested was a result of the “backlash from technology” and living in an increasingly digital world.  Each tote mentions the Strand’s name in some way, usually showcasing that same red oval logo. (The Strand merchandizing team briefly tried a few other designs, replacing the “miles of books” slogan with the phrase “Where books are loved,” but ultimately went back to the original.) Nearly 50 of the designs are credited to MacDonald, who began working out on the art department floor around five years ago. His handiwork ranges from delicate, multicolor illustrations of New Yorkers going about their day to an image of an extensively detailed library with ceiling-high bookshelves and cats around each turn. MacDonald says the idea of a “weird, introvert fantasy world” inspired one of his latest designs: a dusty shelf stocked with a compass, a bell jar, a skull, books and other oddities, all presided over by a black cat. “Stay Curious,” it reads. Ultimately, the designs come out of a collaborative process, with Bass Wyden and other staff members contributing ideas to a department called Studio Strand, which also consists of designers Greg Locke and Alison George and manager Meagan Henry. MacDonald, who hand-draws designs on a tablet, said that the collaboration can lead to little visual “Easter eggs” on the totes. MacDonald included his dog in a tableau of the city’s canine population. On another bag, the Japanese character for “book” takes the place of the “A” in “Strand” — another fun wink for those in the know.  At first glance, the store’s “Victorian Reader” seems to depict a straightforward scene of old-timey New York, with older building facades, horse-drawn carriages and people in the street with their noses in books. Upon closer inspection, the attention to detail — creepy detail ― emerges. There’s a Headless Horseman statue and a violent barber inspired by Sweeney Todd. A carriage is being driven by a skeleton. Two identical twins ride eerily by on a tandem bicycle. “I think [Bass Wyden was] just like, ‘Wouldn’t it be creepy if there were some abandoned shoes in the street?’” MacDonald recalled. “It’s fun to create these opportunities for everyone. Like, what happens if you put a cobweb over here, or what happens if you put, like, a skull at the top of a building?” he continued. “Just making it as immersive as possible.” Elsewhere in the design, a frustrated writer tosses his papers out the window. In another window, Bass Wyden’s grandfather peers out at the scene below. The design has been in the merchandise rotation for several years. “It really is all of that detail that really makes it, you know, resonate for so long,” MacDonald added. With an in-house design team, the bookstore can also adapt quickly to emerging trends and new catchphrases. When “Hamilton” was selling out nightly, a “Young, Scrappy and Hungry” bag popped up on shelves. When the coloring book craze seized bookstores around 2014, Strand answered with a tote featuring outlines of New York staples: a pigeon, the MetroCard. The bookstore also offered “F**k 2016” pins and “Make America Read Again” totes: bold statements in a bold election year that allowed people to wear not just their love of reading, but their frustration, on their sleeves. “I kept saying, ‘Don’t order too much! He’s not gonna be around!’” Bass Wyden said with a laugh, referring, of course, to now-President Donald Trump. The resistance is alive, well and for sale at the bookstore, where Ruth Bader Ginsburg totes lie on a table near others that read, “Nevertheless, She Persisted.” A tote with the saying “A well-read woman is a dangerous creature” features what looks like a straightforward floral motif against black canvas, but upon further inspection, there are bees sprinkled throughout ― subtly underscoring the “dangerous creature” note. Other totes are collaborations with beloved artists like Art Spiegelman and Adrian Tomine. Other designs have come from happenstance. Bass Wyden said a manager who collected autographs and drawings asked painter David Hockney to draw him a picture when he visited the store in the ’70s. Hockney drew a bag of books, which eventually became a tote.  “I thought that was funny, to put a tote on a tote,” Bass Wyden said. For bookstore purists, the growth of the Strand’s in-store merchandise ― increasingly catering to an in-and-out kind of customer rather than one content to spend hours among the stacks ― might seem at odds with the store’s history as a haven for literature and those who love it. It’s understandable that seeing space occupied by bags advertising the store’s lengthy selection of books, instead of the books themselves, could chafe a certain kind of reader. But if a bookstore must diversify its offerings to offset changing publishing trends or to reflect customer tastes, the creations tailored for bibliophiles at the Strand seem like a practical, and charming, way to meet in the middle. In a way, the many canvas bags on offer echo the varied customers drawn to the store in order to peruse its curated tables and outdoor carts — creative, singular, true New York originals."
BUSINESS,"Imagine being submerged inside a downed aircraft in icy water, knowing that to reach air and safety you have to work with fellow passengers. Of course, you understand this is only a training exercise, aimed at honing your capacity for trust, collaboration, and team building. Here’s the question: Will defying death succeed better than the rope courses, scavenger hunts, tug of wars and other standbys of traditional corporate team building? The Groton, Conn.-based company Survival Systems USA is betting that undergoing realistic disaster training is the new trend in helping corporations enhance teamwork, improve leadership and build skills needed for 21st century workplaces. The company is adapting its aquatic survival training into a program for companies seeking to push the envelope in employee team building. The Survival System training, which involves a mock plane or helicopter crash in nasty conditions, is but the latest in moves toward intensive team-building exercises that go far beyond the classic “trust fall.” Exercises may range from rock climbing, rappelling, wilderness camping and sailing to sophisticated “geo hunts” in which teams use GPS to follow clues. Many executives believe that such intensive activities improve morale and increase teamwork (and hence, productivity); they’ve noticed that people who go through such programs bring back a more positive attitude and greater ability to work as a team. However, some team building exercises backfire, leaving employees bewildered, embarrassed and even demoralized. A variety of factors may be pushing companies to engage in team building activities. One is that MBA programs around the country are using similar exercises as teaching tools for graduate students. At MIT Sloan, for example, new students spend a full day together at the Warren Conference Center building a boat and getting their team to cross an area of water. (If it fails, you’re going to get very wet!) At the Mays Business School at Texas A&M University, MBA students undergo a mock training in which they have to deal with the aftermath of a tornado. The goal is to provide training in crisis leadership as well as team building. If MBA students bring away positive experiences from these kinds of exercises, they are more likely to use them as management tools when they enter the workforce. Another force propelling the drive for intensive team building may be related to millennials who have differing expectations for the workplace including an intense interest in the company culture and a desire for a sense of engagement. Thus, extreme training can be a recruitment tool. To be sure, the announcement that your company will undergo a corporate team building exercise often elicits the groan, “Oh, not that again.” Still, smartly organized activities, keyed to real workplace issues, can help to build engagement, improve trust and collaboration and allow employees to be creative. Extreme team building does put you in situations where you have to rely on others to succeed and thus does help to build trust. If you trust your colleagues, you’re much more comfortable stating an opinion. Still, companies may be able to increase trust or encourage creativity without, for example, putting employees into large plastic balls and challenging them to roll downhill. When considering hosting team-building exercises, companies have to determine just what they want to accomplish. Is it to improve morale? Increase collaboration? Consider: Is an exercise in which you pit one team against another going to accomplish your goal of camaraderie or do you want an exercise that focuses on collaboration? Executives should also select activities that are clearly linked to what people do on a daily basis. Planners have to be aware of employees with physical disabilities in choosing a program, so they can be included as well. We are seeing a growing number of professional businesses that design and offer team-building events. If you don’t have an internal person to organize exercises, seek out and consult with the experts in these companies. I’m also a big fan of being transparent and upfront about why a company is asking its employees to go through an exercise. Here’s another key point: What are the next steps after the exercise is over? It is dangerous to think that you can create a terrific team culture through just one particular program. It’s an ongoing process. You do have to be careful with team building – it may not accomplish everything that you might hope it will. Another trend in corporate team building may help both company and community. Some companies are creating opportunities for employees to work for a period of time on a humanitarian project in a poor or underserved area. Such projects can build workplace skills as well as provide a service to those in need. An employee is likely to be much more positive about a company that supports that kind of project. Extreme team building may represent the next evolution in corporate management, but it may not be right for every company. Sometimes a company softball game will be just as effective.

ENTERTAINMENT,"What’s in a name? For Han Solo, everything and nothing. The skilled pilot and notorious smuggler’s moniker was heretofore unexplained, which makes sense: First and last names rarely require complex exposition, at least not the kind that Han gets in “Solo: A Star Wars Story,” the second spinoff in this ever-inflating franchise (2016′s war-torn “Rogue One” was the first). “Who are your people?” an Imperial guard asks at customs, surrounded by recruitment propaganda for the evil Empire. “I don’t have people; I’m alone,” Han responds, declining to provide a surname. Can you see where this is heading? The agent eyes Han’s swoopy brown hair and round cheeks, landing on the only logical conclusion: Solo. He’ll be known as Han Solo. Get it? Disney executives have been touting this reveal since March of last year, back when “21 Jump Street” and “Lego Movie” maestros Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were directing “Solo.” A few months later, the studio replaced Lord and Miller with Ron Howard, citing “different creative visions,” standard PR-speak for “they’re not making the movie we want them to make.” The studio also hired a new editor, cast Paul Bettany as a key villain formerly played by Michael K. Williams (who wasn’t available for the necessary reshoots), and brought in an acting coach to help Alden Ehrenreich, the actor given the demanding task of living up to Harrison Ford’s unmatchable charisma. A lot changed, but one thing never wavered: Han Solo’s name would still receive an impossibly trite backstory. And now it’s canon. Oh well. The “Star Wars” universe has seen worse ― and, with more standalone entries and new trilogies (plural!) on the horizon, it will probably see worse still. (Like Mr. Solo, Disney is no stranger to being “in it for the money.”) For a film riddled with backstage drama, “Solo” is a fluid, entertaining diversion in a series that has gotten so much right since being resurrected with 2015′s “The Force Awakens.” It’s the first “Star Wars” movie that is, at worst, a waste of time. Thankfully, it’s a harmless waste of time. Its dexterity should come as no surprise: Ron Howard is nothing if not competent. A journeyman with few stylistic idiosyncrasies, Howard can take us to locales as various and foreign as outer space (“Apollo 13”), the Louvre (“The Da Vinci Code”) and the American Midwest (“Parenthood”) without losing sight of the everyday ingenuity prevailing within his protagonists. (“I don’t have people” is Han’s version of ingenuity.) Working with Bradford Young, the wunderkind of a cinematographer who shot “Selma” and “Arrival,” Howard has crafted a zippy origin story that’s as superfluous to the broader “Star Wars” design as it is captivating to watch. Setting out to fill a few gaps in the galaxy’s overarching big-screen mythology, this proto-Han saga doesn’t bring the titular nerf herder face-to-face with Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, Darth Vader, C-3PO or Greedo. We’re still years away from those fateful meetings. No hokey religions or ancient weapons here. Instead, everything that happens in “Solo” hinges on the dude’s attachment to Qi’ra (Emilia Clarke), a childhood comrade who doesn’t make it past the gates of the aforementioned customs bureau, where Han tries to bargain using a tube of coveted hyper-speed fuel known as coaxium. Determined to rescue Qi’ra and escape the mounting Imperial takeover, Han endears himself to Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson), a crafty scoundrel claiming a mission to steal 100,000 grams of coaxium for silvery British villain Dryden Vos (Bettany).  Each “Star Wars” movie is obliged to reboot the Mos Eisley cantina scene from “A New Hope,” and “Solo” places one of its renditions (yes, there is more than one) in the midst of Vos’ rowdy palace. It’s there that Han finds Qi’ra, who now calls herself Vos’ lieutenant but is better described as his cunning captive. Cue the schemes. Still with me? Phew. Amid a heap of jargon that father-son screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan (“The Empire Strikes Back”) and Jonathan Kasdan (“In the Land of Women”) successfully mold into comprehensible anchor points, Han picks up a few recognizable faces on his path to secure Vos’ gleaming gasoline. He befriends a Wookiee named Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), acquires a piece of junk called the Millennium Falcon from a suave cardsharp swashbuckler named Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover, MVP) and pilots the perilous smuggling route referenced in “A New Hope” (called the Kessel Run and allegedly completed in less than 12 parsecs, if you’re keeping pace). That’s all good and well, if you ignore how many newcomers are sidelined so our old friends can fraternize a little longer. Don’t get me started on just how thankless Thandie Newton’s role is. All together, this outline comprises enough of a plot to almost distract from the fact that “Solo: A Star Wars Story” is an affront to everything Harrison Ford brought to the original movies. Aside from a bomber jacket and the patch of chest hair poking out from his V-neck, Ehrenreich is nothing like Ford. And he’s not really given the chance to be. The script makes Han more of a smug gentleman than a cavalier tomcat. Much of the dry wit and cocky gaze brought to the screen by Ford, who famously hated the dialogue that George Lucas handed him, has been shaved down to asides so peripheral to the characterization that this might as well revolve around a brand-new protagonist. Ford gave the originals an ironic touch, winking at the kiddie-movie proceedings around him. But Ehrenreich is too amiable for that. By the time Han is positioned opposite Vos’ overlord, a known villain from “Star Wars” lore, both the timeline that governs these stories and the hallmarks that define their characters have more or less fallen to the wayside. Still, the events chug along; at least there’s comfort in Chewie’s howl. What to do, then, with a movie that is so decidedly fine, in a franchise demarcated by the highest of highs and the lowest of lows? Do we celebrate because it’s not a disaster? Cry foul because it’s not über-faithful to one of the series’ greatest figures? Pop streamers because it’s more fun than the bleak, tactical “Rogue One” and more picturesque than the gaudy, bloated prequels? Do we decry the logic gaps and the cheap reveals? (At one point, a soldier removes her helmet with sweeping grandeur, as if the movie were re-introducing a familiar character — one of a few “huh?” moments where the style contradicts the story being told.) What to do, then, is all of these things. We’re right to demand more originality in today’s blockbusters, but a standalone installment such as this is only capable of providing so much. With that in mind, you want to see the same Han Solo you’ve always known, the one whose gruff charm would soften only slightly after fathering Kylo Ren. You want a fresh story in a familiar world. “Solo,” unconcerned with deepening the good-versus-evil theology that suffuses the sequels, relies on pure momentum, rather than detailed world-building, to map its adventure. In Howard’s hands, that, too, is fine, if not especially inspired. Such is the fate of a property that has ballooned beyond its foundation. Where last year’s “The Last Jedi,” in its poised and sophisticated way, created fresh ground for the saga by pulling up its Skywalker roots, “Solo” works diligently to plug longstanding narrative holes that were never that vital in the first place. As the central storyline soars ahead, the offshoots are predicated on tertiary details of yore ― Kessel Runs, Death Star blueprints and other one-off blips. Meh. That “Solo: A Star Wars Story” manages to be entertaining ― the creatures! the capes! Phoebe Waller-Bridge voicing a sassy droid! ― in spite of its hurdles is a testament to Ron Howard’s scrappiness. We never needed to know how Han Solo got his name, but what’s the harm if we do? “Solo: A Star Wars Story” opens in theaters May 25."
BUSINESS,"Sometimes the law is on your side in cases of employment discrimination. And sometimes it isn’t. If you are a woman, person of color, older or disabled, chances are high that if you fought the law, the law won. The bombshell release last week of allegations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein for decades of sexual harassment and discrimination against women resulted in his being fired from his position as co-chair of the Weinstein Company. The fallout was decisive. “It is essential to our Company’s culture that all women who work for it or have any dealings with it or any of our executives are treated with respect and have no experience of harassment or discrimination,” the board reported, according to Buzzfeed. But such swift and definitive action is not the norm. The silence around a legacy of incidents like those surrounding Hurricane Harvey Weinstein is perpetuated in most all industries. The authors of the new book, Rights on Trial: How Workplace Discrimination Perpetuates Inequality, examined nearly 2,000 cases filed between 1988 and 2003 across the U.S.. The three authors interviewed more than 100 plaintiffs, defendants, lawyers and involved parties to find that the workplace often is not fair in cases of discrimination. The success rate for cases of discrimination filed is dismal; only two percent of plaintiffs win at trial. That is after 19 percent of the cases were dismissed. Half or 50 percent have early settlements, 18 percent of the cases are lost on summary judgment and 8 percent of the cases have a late settlement. But each one of those cases is a story. And in each one of of those cases, voice is a metaphor for civil justice. “Voice is important in legal disputes,” says Laura Beth Nielsen, a co-author of the book, that literally gives voice to those involved with audio clips of the interviews on its site. In these “workplace wars,” the stories are heartbreaking,” says Nielsen, research professor at the American Bar Foundation, and Professor of Sociology and Director of Legal Studies at Northwestern University. Consider the case of Kristen Baker, whose case is highlighted in the book. Baker was a 33-year-old assistant buyer in the sales division of a small, family-owned manufacturing company. A salesman “began bringing pornographic magazines and movies to work” and also charging for admission to viewing parties of those movies in the conference room at lunch time. He showed her pictures of bestiality. She filed multiple complaints to human resources, then the final straw was the salesman’s physical act of sexual harassment. So Baker filed a discrimination case. Her employer offered her $10,000 to leave the company. Baker eventually settled for $1, a public apology and the option to keep her job. Authors Nielsen, Robert L. Nelson and Ellen Berrey write in the book: It may be difficult to believe that discrimination this blatant and offensive still occurs in American workplaces every day, but it does. In her new book, Reset: My Fight for Inclusion and Lasting Change, Ellen Pao, who lost her $16 million gender discrimination lawsuit against the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 2015, said it was worth it to tell her story that “started a conversation about systemic bias in Silicon Valley, giving others the courage to report their own experiences,” according to Recode. “The sad thing is we tend to reject people who make rights claims,” says Nelson, a co-author and  Director Emeritus of the American Bar Foundation, the MacCrate Research Chair in the Legal Profession at the ABF, and professor of sociology and law at Northwestern. “We have a process where prominent stereotypes about persons of color, women, the aged and disabled” come into play, Nelson says. A  gender discrimination suit was filed recently against Winston & Strawn, adding to gender discrimination suits by former attorneys against legacy law firms Steptoe & Johnson LLP, Chadbourne & Parke, Proskauer Rose, LeClairRyan and Sedgwick, according to Above The Law.   In the most recent case brought by Constance Ramos, “as reported by Law.com, the complaint alleges Ramos was never treated as a lawyer and partner in her own right, but as ‘an appendage of a male superior’ that the firm sought to be rid of when the equity partners that Ramos joined the firm with, ultimately left Winston.” Ramos’ experience of being excluded from meetings is similar to the experiences of Pao, who told PBS News Hour: Such high profile lawsuits are extremely rare. Fewer than one percent of employees who perceive they were discriminated against, file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. And only 15 percent of EEOC charges lead to a lawsuit filed, and only 6 percent of those cases make it to trial. “We see a symbolic valorization of rights in the abstract,” says co-author Ellen Berrey, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Toronto and an affiliated scholar of the American Bar Foundation. But in real, concrete terms, there is “structural inequality,” Berrey says, recalling that one defense attorney claimed he “never saw a valid case.” While this book covers U.S. cases, workplace discrimination is an international problem. “According to a 2017 report by the International Labor Organization (ILO), there is no universally accepted definition of ‘harassment’ or ‘violence’ with regard to the world of work,” according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Gayle Tzemach Lemmon writes: In this country, to improve the system and to change policy with “the levers of power,” according to Nelson, the authors offer several suggestions. These strategies include providing more access to legal representation; more EEOC resources and state fair employment agencies; better forms of communication with the EEOC and charging parties; access to employee information for employees on demographics and compensation; and addressing racial disparities in legal representation. Employees telling their stories of discrimination and reporting are initial steps.  The more voices, the louder the call for equity. Pao told PBS News Hour: As Jennifer Siebel Newsom, founder and CEO of The Representation Project, filmmaker of “Miss Representation” and “The Mask You Live In,” writes on HuffPost: This post originally ran in Take The Lead.

ENTERTAINMENT,"(Reuters) - Singer Carrie Underwood returned to the stage on Sunday after a serious face injury as country stars went back to Las Vegas for the first time since a mass shooting there last October. Opening the three-hour Academy of Country Music (ACM) awards show at a hotel less than a mile from the scene of the Oct. 1 shooting that killed 58 people and wounded more than 850, singer Jason Aldean paid tribute to the victims and invoked the healing power of music. “We wanted to open the show with something that sums up what it’s like for our country music family to be back in Las Vegas for the first time since October 1,” said Aldean, who was performing on stage when a gunman opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest country festival from the window of a hotel on the Vegas strip. “We thought about starting with a song, but it’s a lot bigger than a single song. It’s everything you’ll hear tonight,” said the “You Make It Easy” singer, who was later named entertainer of the year. In the most anticipated performance of the night, Underwood emerged from five months of isolation following a fall at her home that required 40-50 stitches to her face. Performing her new single “Cry Pretty,” her face seemed well recovered and Underwood was welcomed back with a long standing ovation that left the former “American Idol” winner overcome with emotion. “I’m still kinda shaky right now,” Underwood said afterward, fighting back tears. Miranda Lambert was named female vocalist of the year for the 9th time in a row, and she also won best song for her heartbreaking single “Tin Man,” thought to be inspired by her 2015 divorce from country star Blake Shelton. “Thanks for sharing my broken heart with me,” said Lambert, accepting her award in front of an audience that included Shelton and his new girlfriend, pop singer Gwen Stefani. Lambert also made ACM history by taking her all-time wins to 32, surpassing the record held by veteran duo Brooks & Dunn. Other winners on Sunday included Chris Stapleton for both male vocalist and album of the year for “From a Room: Vol. 1”; Old Dominion for vocal group of the year, and Brothers Osborne for vocal duo of the year. Stapleton was not present because his wife was expecting twins. Show host Reba McEntire, accepting the award on his behalf, broke the news of their arrival. “We just found out that those little rascals came a little bit early. Hot off the press, twin boys,” said McEntire."
ARTS & CULTURE," There comes a point in her Act II monologue when the Kostelnicka, the moral guardian of a turn-of-the-century mill town in Moravia and the step-mother of the titular Jenůfa, imagines how the villagers will decry her and her stepdaughter when they find out about Jenůfa's illegitimate child. ""Look at her! Look at her! Kostelnicka!"" Well, with the white-knuckled Karita Mattila playing the upright, deeply conflicted Kostelnicka, it simply isn't possible to look away. Leos Janáček's Jenůfa premiered in Brno in 1904 and returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Friday for the first time in ten years. The bleak opera is a fascinating and elegantly-proportioned psychological study that elevates the thorough development of themes of jealousy, shame, and love into an airtight and believable case study. Taken from the play Her Stepdaughter by Gabriela Preissová, the plot revolves around the young, thoughtful Jenůfa who falls in love with and is pregnant by Steva, the heir to a mill. But when her childhood friend Laca slashes her face out of jealousy, Steva abandons Jenůfa, and her image-conscious stepmother, the Kostelnicka, shelters her until the baby is born. Terrified that the baby will stigmatize Jenůfa, the Kostelnicka drowns it in the ice while Jenůfa sleeps and tells her the baby died. The Kostelnicka then brokers the marriage of Jenůfa and Laca, but the body of the baby is discovered by the villagers in the thawing river on the day of the wedding. The Kostelnicka succumbs to her guilt, admits to the deed, and is taken to prison, while Jenůfa, humiliated, tries to release the insistently-committed Laca. The characters all end up about as unhappy as they were at the start of the opera and humdrum village life assumedly goes on.  Returning to the Met for the first time in 5 seasons, Mattila made a tremendous and extraordinarily-paced house-role debut as the crumbling sexton's widow. At age 56, Mattila still commands an easily-produced, soft-grained soprano with a distant pinch that she imbues with an extraordinary intensity, dramatic alertness, and attention to the Czech text. She isn't afraid to cry out or let the voice go white for a moment for effect and the shocking lines of her Act II monologue were both enunciated and screamed to a chilling result as she resolves to kill Jenůfa's son. Her high notes were effortlessly produced and her low notes were impressively secure in what was a welcome and overdue return for the undiminished Finnish soprano.
Unfortunately, though, Mattila was matched nowhere else in the cast, least of all by the Jenůfa of Ukranian Oksana Dyka. Dyka's voice has turned from steely, laser-like focus to an edgy, strident wobble. Though her upper range is more intact and she can still ride the breath effectively, her lower range sounds dull and curdled and she didn't lend the music any of the pastoral lyricism is demands despite attempts at sincere delivery. Not a natural actress, she was majorly undercut by Olivier Tambosi's lackluster-but-inoffensive production that had her spend most of the evening posing near the stage-dominating rock. This Jenůfa wasn't so much a layered, tormented young woman as much as a baleful, shrieking village girl with a penchant for literacy. Her suitors fared better. Daniel Brenna's forceful heldentenor might not have been an ideal fit for Laca, but he sang with a youthful rambunctiousness and acted with commitment to the production which imagined him as more of a playground bully than a predator. Joseph Kaiser took some time to warm up as Steva, but once he did, his singing was confident and his negotiation of Czech even more so. He did sometimes compete to be heard with the orchestra, though, which conductor  David Robertson lead with great attention to the intricacies of Janáček's orchestral writing. The village scenes have a lot of moving parts, and Robertson managed them with ease and even scaled down his approach for the intimate Act II. That said, his conducting was taut, exciting, and tense the entire evening. The superb Metropolitan Opera Orchestra adroitly responded accordingly and the Chorus sounded in top shape. Other standouts of the cast included the indispensable Ying Fang whose distant, pearly soprano was a delight as Jano, Hanna Schwarz who sang with commitment and worn tone as the Grandmother Buryja, and Bradley Garvin who balanced generous phrasing and beautiful tone in his short appearance as the foreman. Frank Philip Schlössmann's geologically-inspired sets and subdued costumes got the job done.  Jenůfa runs through November 17th at the Metropolitan Opera and you'd be silly to miss Karita Mattila doing what she does best (besides the splits). Tickets available here.

Those who make the cut will probably come as close to receiving a Hogwarts acceptance letter as a muggle could possibly dream of.  The memo itemizes all the roles under consideration, along with short descriptions of the characters. Luckily, most of us already know the parts quite intimately. Harry Potter, for example, is described as “Father of James, Albus and Lily. Married to Ginny. Head of Magical Law Enforcement at the Ministry of Magic.” The actor who takes on the role should be no taller than 5’10” and between the ages of 37 and 40. The casting call notes, as well, that every role, all ethnicities are welcome.  Those familiar with the London run of play might recall that Hermione Granger was played by black actress, Noma Dumezweni. Despite the fact that Rowling described Granger in the books as having brown eyes and bushy brown hair, with no mention of her being white, the casting decision was met by some with outrage, outrage Rowling dutifully called out as straight-up racist.  Thus, it’s exciting to see that Rowling and the “Cursed Child” team have continued the tradition of colorblind casting. Given the author’s glorious skewering of the bigoted Twitter trolls in her mentions, it’s not too surprising that she is using her platform to spread a message of diversity and inclusion.  Head to the listing itself to see if you have what it takes to play Harry, Ginny, Moaning Myrtle or Professor McGonagall. The pay, if you’re curious, is $1,974 a week. If you have talent, or a lightning-shaped scar on your forehead, please apply. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"This student just transformed a negative into a positive in the most beautiful way. When Claudia Vulliamy found out that the prestigious Oxford University in England had turned her down for a place on its classics course Wednesday, she was understandably disappointed. But she didn’t get downhearted. Instead, the 18-year-old student at Camden School for Girls in London hacked up the letter of rejection and worked it into a painting. Yesterday, my daughter learned that she hadn't got into Oxford. By the time I got in from work, she'd made this from her rejection letter pic.twitter.com/KCInrTA1OO Her mom, Louisa Saunders, posted the above photograph of her creation on Twitter, and the image is now going viral. “When I got home to see the painting, I laughed, because it was funny and also sassy,” Saunders told The Huffington Post on Saturday. “It was nice, because I could see that she wasn’t feeling too sad about the rejection. I know it breaks some people’s hearts,” she added. “I really admired her spirit, but I wasn’t very surprised because it’s fairly typical of her ― she’s always been creative.” Saunders’ Twitter feed was soon flooded with positive comments about her daughter’s inspired work of art: @louisa_saunders @AMCELL Oxford missed their chance with your daughter. Bigger and better things coming. @louisa_saunders She doesn't need a place at Oxford, she needs her own gallery exhibition. @louisa_saunders She's amazing and will go far. She is her own woman and that's the most important thing. @louisa_saunders what a brilliant response, good for her. rejection is difficult, but it moves us forwards in other ways. she'll do well. Vuilliamy, meanwhile, told HuffPost she was “really surprised” that her artwork went viral, but she’s “so glad that it has cheered people up.” “Usually social media can be quite brutal but it made my week,” she added to ITV News. “I just thought it was a bit of a bummer not to get in. I felt like making it into something.” She now hopes to study at Durham University ― and continues posting new artwork, such as the piece below depicting her mom, to Instagram:  My mum, in acrylic #art A photo posted by Claudia Vulliamy (@flamboyant_aesthete) on Jan 12, 2017 at 4:03pm PST"
BUSINESS,"Millennials have been getting hammered by the media and their older counterparts for years and it really needs to STOP! I am a Gen X - Boomer cusper, meaning I was born on the year someone decided to change the names. I supposedly possess characteristics from Generation X as well as the Baby Boomers. It is supposed to cause me great anxiety as I plow through life with one foot on each side of the generational line. I guess there is a little truth to that but it is not as black and white as generational “experts” want you to believe. I consider myself an Intergenerational Engagement “expert” primarily because I have had the opportunity to work around k-12 education for 20 plus years. I have experienced the changing family dynamics at work and in the schools. I’ve seen the positive and negative effects of technology on kids and parents. We are all living in a confusing time and we all seem to me STRESSED OUT!  Much of the confusion is coming from personality and generation-based communications challenges. For the first time in our history, we have five generations active in the economy. This creates challenges for employers, marketers, educators and even non-profit organizations. A one size fits all communications or marketing plan will no longer suffice. My company specializes in helping organizations enhance their internal and external communications by embracing their “Age Diversity.” We help individuals from all generations and each personality style become self-aware by, first understanding why they may act or feel a certain way. We then help them understand the “general” characteristics of others who may be from a different generation or have a polar opposite personality style. As Stephen Covey wisely says,“Seek first to understand, then be understood.” Those of you who follow my rantings are aware that I am a big Gen Y fan. I believe Millennials will end up being the most creative and giving generation ever. Even though I am not a Millennial, I understand why they get upset with all the stereotypes and generalities that pundits spew about “their kind.” I had the pleasure of coming across the following post by Chloe Bryan that was originally posted on Mashable July 31, 2017. Chloe, a Millennial listed 70 things that her generation has been accused of killing. What I love about her work is that she actually linked to the “murder piece” she referenced for each of the 70 things. “Here are all the things millennials have been accused of killing.

POLITICS,"President Donald Trump addressed the National Rifle Association’s annual convention on Friday and profusely thanked Kanye West for doubling his African-American polling numbers. “Kanye West must have some power,” Trump said. “I doubled my African-American poll numbers. We went from 11 to 22 in one week. Thank you, Kanye, thank you.” Trump went on to say that he initially thought the increase “must be a mistake” and that even “the pollsters thought that was a mistake.” Pres. Trump claims he doubled his support among African-Americans in past week.""Kanye West must have some power...Thank you, Kanye."" https://t.co/YlVHW6ff42 pic.twitter.com/WgN0eUj5uv The polling numbers Trump was referring to were likely from a Reuters/Ipsos poll that asked respondents, “Do you approve or disapprove about the way Donald Trump is handling his job as President?” Filtered for black male respondents, the poll does show Trump’s approval increasing from about 11 to about 22 percent. For black people overall, the increase was from about 9 to about 17 percent. It’s worth noting that polls by YouGov/Economist and SurveyMonkey did not reveal much of a shift in black Americans’ opinions of Trump between April 19 and May 1. Many on social media couldn’t help but comment on Trump’s remarks. Donald Trump thanks Kanye West again during his #NRAConvention speech while misrepresenting his approval rating with black voters. Now is a good time to mention that Trump still hasn't thanked Waffle House hero James Shaw Jr. pic.twitter.com/Sk4nQ4FALU At the NRA, Trump said, Kanye West must have some power.

So far in his NRA speechTrump has praised: Paul Manafort, Kanye West, Diamond and Silk, a bunch of TX politiciansand dissed: the media, Obama, John Kerry and John McCain ""President Donald Trump thanks Kanye West on stage at the NRA convention"" we live in a nightmare Mad Lib Trump speaking to the NRA and thanking Kanye for helping his poll numbers is truly the 9th circle of hell. Trump’s praise for West at the convention isn’t particularly surprising. He’s been effusive about the rapper since West’s tweetstorm last week in which he lauded the president and shared a snapshot of a MAGA hat. Trump thanked West at the time with a quote-tweet, and also tweeted about the “Famous” singer two days later, crediting West with performing “a great service” to the black community. You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought. Thank you Kanye, very cool! https://t.co/vRIC87M21X Kanye West has performed a great service to the Black Community - Big things are happening and eyes are being opened for the first time in Decades - Legacy Stuff! Thank you also to Chance and Dr. Darrell Scott, they really get it (lowest Black & Hispanic unemployment in history). Trump has made claims before that black and Hispanic unemployment rates are at or near record lows, but, as NPR fact-checked, “it’s generally a stretch for presidents to take credit for job creation.” West has recently been embroiled in controversy for saying he believed slavery was “a choice.” Just moments after Trump thanked him, he tweeted two missives: “if you’re in the way of your own life you’ll end up in the way of other people’s lives too” and “enjoy the present.”"
ENTERTAINMENT,"The lord has opened, people. Hulu announced during the 2018 Digital Content NewFronts event on Wednesday that the award-winning series “The Handmaid’s Tale” will be renewed for a third season. The news comes just a week after the second season premiere, which show runners said had the most-viewed series debut on Hulu ever.  Based on Margaret Atwood’s feminist dystopian novel, “The Handmaid’s Tale”  has won dozens of awards since its first season premiered in 2017, including a Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series. The first season received 13 Emmy nominations and won eight, while also being nominated for three Golden Globes and winning two.   Show runner Bruce Miller told HuffPost before the Season 2 premiere that he hopes fans love this new season as much as they did the first one, since the second season is a continuum of Atwood’s novel.  “It’s scary to start out adapting such a sacred book, and then it’s terrifying to continue to adapt [it], especially after people liked the first season,” Miller said. “If people hate the first season, there’s nothing to lose. People like it, they want to see what happens next, and we want to make sure that they are satisfied.” Well, we are certainly satisfied. But, also, completely and utterly tortured. "
BUSINESS,"United Airlines received a rare bit of good news this week: As unpopular as the carrier is, it’s still doing better in the court of public opinion than President Donald Trump.  United made headlines earlier this month after a passenger was violently dragged off a flight to make room for an employee. Now a new poll from the left-leaning Public Policy Polling found that the airline had a slightly higher approval rating than the president. When asked if they had a higher opinion of United or Trump, 42 percent of the respondents chose the airline, versus 40 percent for the president. That’s pretty much the only bright spot for United; the poll also found that 40 percent believed it was the worst airline in the country. American was a distant second at 10 percent.  Thirty-five percent of respondents chose Southwest as the “best airline,” with Delta coming in second at 20 percent. The president’s numbers were similar to recent polling from Gallup, which showed Trump with an average approval rating of just 41 percent since inauguration day, the lowest rating for a first-term president since World War II. The most recent HuffPost Pollster aggregate pegged his disapproval rating at 50.6 percent. "
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― This week, the House of Representatives may vote to add more “work requirements” to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.  Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said the measure, part of what is often called the farm bill, will help businesses fill the record number of job openings. “It’s about workforce development,” Ryan said Thursday, adding that the reforms are “proven to get people off of the sidelines and into full-time employment.” While the farm bill reauthorizes agricultural subsidies, roughly 80 percent of bill’s spending is SNAP benefits, which help 40 million Americans buy food every month. Implementing more stringent work requirements would burnish Ryan’s legacy by partially fulfilling a lifelong goal: making the American safety net a little less like a “hammock,” as he once called it. Food stamps already come with work requirements for able-bodied adults, but the bill would expand the number of people required to do at least 20 hours of “work activities,” which can include actual work or signing up for a new government training program.  While the legislation would certainly reduce food stamp enrollment, it’s unclear how much it would actually develop the workforce.  Republicans have shaken their fists at food stamps for much of the program’s existence ― even as it helped eradicate starvation in the U.S. They’ve shaken their fists even more vigorously as SNAP enrollment soared in the wake of the Great Recession. Their antipathy stems in part from the program’s cost, and also the belief that alleviating material suffering can somehow leave people worse off in the long term. As Ryan put it in 2014, liberal governance gives poor people “a full stomach and an empty soul.” But above all, the Republican argument for reforming food stamps and other benefit programs lately is about funneling more workers into the labor force.  “Our message to Americans who are really trapped on welfare is, ‘We need you,’” Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) told HuffPost. “We think you have great skills and a great future, and we want to find a way to help you.” “At a time when the economy’s doing great and companies are looking for workers, we have millions of people that gave up because of the bad Obama economy,” Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) said. “We want to help those people get back into the workforce and become part of the American Dream again and promote prosperity instead of poverty.” “My hope is with requiring food stamp recipients to either work or be in job training, there will be more workers available,” Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) told a local TV station. Republicans say they love wage increases, particularly when companies say they’re raising pay because of tax cuts. Theoretically, though, increasing the supply of labor would make workers less valuable, since more people would have to compete for limited jobs. Republicans say not enough of that kind of competition has been happening. With the national unemployment rate down to 3.9 percent, lawmakers say businesses in their districts are constantly complaining about a shortage of available workers. “The number one problem for employers today is they can’t find people to work,” Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) said.  The problem could be more accurately characterized as employers can’t find people to work for what employers want to pay.  Grothman said a trucking company in his district is offering to train new hires at a starting salary of $50,000, but it couldn’t find any takers partly because of food stamps and other programs. “It surprises me how much employers can offer and still complain that they can’t beat what the government pays,” he said.  That salary isn’t bad, but it’s not especially high for truckers, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The average 2017 wage for heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers in Fond du Lac County, in the center of Grothman’s district, was $48,740. The data suggest the firm that complained to Grothman is not offering a wage that far exceeds what potential drivers could get from other employers in the area. Roughly half of new hires are people leaving other jobs. (Meanwhile, monthly food stamp benefits average $125 per person in a household and can only be redeemed for food items in grocery stores.)  Wages have been rising modestly, but not at a rate that most economists consider consistent with a tight labor market. Annual wage growth has not exceeded 3 percent since the recession ended in 2009. In other words, workers aren’t so scarce that their value is going up in the eyes of employers. Most firms could probably lure good workers by offering more money. The worker shortage story is not something that just popped up as unemployment dipped beneath 4 percent. In the wake of the recession, lawmakers often lamented a so-called “skills gap” ― there were plenty of workers available, the thinking went, but a shortage of good ones. Jason Faberman, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, found the theory wanting when he and his colleague Bhash Mazumder studied it in 2012. Faberman finds it even less plausible today. “It would be easier to argue this story if there was a lot more wage growth than we’ve seen,” Faberman said. “Firms are always complaining they can’t find workers to fill jobs.” Making food stamps less generous is one strategy for increasing the number of people seeking employment, at least theoretically.  “Food stamps provide income separate from working that phases out the more you work,” Matt Bruenig, founder of the People’s Policy Project, a left-wing think tank, said in an email. “Thus it is supposed to reduce labor supply some because people do not need to work as much to get by.” Food stamp enrollment is already declining as the economy improves. If current trends hold the Congressional Budget Office expects 32 million Americans to be receiving benefits in 2028, a reduction of 8 million. The proposed work requirements would shrink the rolls by an additional 1.2 million over that time.  Most of the $9 billion saved on benefits would be reinvested in a substantial new state-federal training program, though details are sketchy on how it would work. The CBO said even after 10 years, states would only be able to provide training to 80 percent of SNAP recipients subject to the new rules.  Roughly 6.5 percent of current SNAP recipients will be able-bodied adults without dependents next year, meaning they will already be subject to a three-month limit on benefits if they’re not working 20 hours per week. The bill would expand similar requirements to an additional 17 percent of SNAP recipients, such as people in their fifties and parents of children between 6 and 18. About a quarter of those would lose benefits, either because they’re not working or not able to comply with the proposed monthly documentation of their work effort.  Those people would have to rely more on market income to pay for food, and so they might be more willing to take lower-paying jobs. But in a labor market of more than 150 million workers, a million fewer food stamp recipients wouldn’t have a huge impact, said Dean Baker, an economist with the Center for Economic and Policy Research.  “The plausible estimate of how much this could affect labor supply is really pretty small,” Baker said.  The targeted population may be less estranged from the workforce than Republicans think. Looking at working-age adults who received SNAP benefits over several months in 2012, the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that a majority worked while they received benefits, and nearly three-quarters worked in the year before or after. Republicans have seemingly convinced themselves that kicking people off food stamps immediately results in increased earnings for those people, but that’s largely due to a reliance on questionable research. The conservative Foundation for Government Accountability has said that after Kansas kicked 13,000 people off food stamps in 2013, nearly two-thirds of those people eventually wound up working, according to state payroll data.  Republican members of Congress and the Trump administration have cited the FGA’s work to claim that work requirements are a proven policy, as Paul Ryan said last week.  The problem with the foundation’s report is that rather than use a comparison group to show what happens in the absence of the policy change, it just assumed the people who lost their benefits would have indefinitely remained SNAP recipients instead of getting jobs. The Center on Budget’s research suggests that’s not really what happens.  Food stamps exist because American politicians decided it was wrong to let poor people starve to death. There has always been tension between the program’s anti-hunger mission and the fact that it increases the economic independence of its beneficiaries, reducing the hardship of unemployment and making people less dependent on labor income for their survival. Republicans and Democrats tend to agree that the “dignity of work” is one of the most important things a person can have. Rep. Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.), chairman of the subcommittee that wrote the food stamp parts of the farm bill, said he’s not out to create more workers, contrary to the heap of statements from others in his party. He said that using the program to shunt more people into training programs and jobs will ultimately make them less hungry.  “For me, it’s not doing things to people in any way, it’s providing for people,” he said. “We only want them to have better food security.”"
ENTERTAINMENT,"CBS’ acknowledgment of a “workplace concern” involving Pauley Perrette of the crime drama “NCIS” prompted a response from the actress on Tuesday. Perrette earlier posted a series of cryptic tweets saying she had endured “multiple physical assaults” and suggested that may have contributed to her departure from the show. “It’s horrifying,” she wrote. “I left.” CBS Television Studios issued a statement late Tuesday confirming that “over a year ago” Perrette ― who played forensic scientist Abby Sciuto on “NCIS” for 15 seasons before her final episode aired last week ― “came to us with a workplace concern. We took the matter seriously and worked with her to find a resolution. We are committed to a safe work environment on all our shows.” Perrette responded on Twitter by saying the network “always had my back.” I want to thank my studio and network CBS They have always been so good to me and always had my back. Here are Perrette’s earlier tweets: I refused to go low, that's why I've never told publicly what happened. But there are tabloid articles out there that are telling total lies about me. If you believe them? Please leave me alone. You clearly don't know me. (Sorry guys, had to be said) Maybe I'm wrong for not ""spilling the beans"" Telling the story, THE TRUTH. I feel I have to protect my crew, jobs and so many people. But at what cost? I.don't know. Just know, I'm trying to do the right thing, but maybe silence isn't the right thing about crime. I'm... Just... ? There is a ""machine' keeping me silent, and feeding FALSE stories about me.  A very rich, very powerful publicity ""machine"". No morals, no obligation to truth, and I'm just left here, reading the lies, trying to protect my crew. Trying to remain calm. He did it. I've been supporting ant-bullying programs forever. But now I KNOW because it was ME! If it's school or work, that you're required to go to? It's horrifying. I left. Multiple Physical Assaults. I REALLY get it now. Stay safe. Nothing is worth your safety. Tell someone. And here is CBS Television Studios’ full statement: “Pauley Perrette had a terrific run on NCIS and we are all going to miss her.Over a year ago, Pauley came to us with a workplace concern. We took the matter seriously and worked with her to find a resolution. We are committed to a safe work environment on all our shows.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,"When Mindy Kaling’s show “The Mindy Project” premiered in 2012, few would have accused it of having an after-school special vibe. Her character, a Manhattan OB/GYN with a romantic comedy addiction and an endless parade of hot (and white) boyfriends, had no concerns outside of getting introduced to NBA players at clubs and running into her ex at a friend’s Thanksgiving. But over the course of five seasons, a move to Hulu, and myriad exclamations of “exsqueeze me??”, the picture has changed.  “When we first started the show, I think, at first, we weren’t talking about [social issues] as much,” writer Ike Barinholtz, who also plays the delightfully awful nurse Morgan Tookers on the show, told The Huffington Post in a phone conversation. “But I think the world’s changed a little bit.”   Season five of “The Mindy Project” wrapped up on Tuesday with (spoiler alert!) Mindy Lahiri’s just-okay proposal to boyfriend Ben (Bryan Greenberg). Soon after, EW reported that the sitcom would be returning to Hulu for a sixth season, which will also be its last. In five seasons, “The Mindy Project” has been through more ups and downs than the average TV show; cancelled by Fox after three seasons on the air, the show was picked up by Hulu as a streaming series. There’s been no shortage of drama on-screen as well. Mindy Lahiri, the OB/GYN played by show creator Kaling, has been engaged (several times), had a child, split up with her son’s father, started her own fertility business, and now is poised to be a stepmother to a tween girl. In its first season, the show took flak from critics for being too surface-level, too girly and, oddly enough, too white (especially Mindy’s parade of pale boyfriends). On the verge of its final season, the show has quietly become a consistently political one. That’s not to say that the show traffics in “Saturday Night Live”-level satire. The presidential election didn’t become a plot point on the fifth season, or even fodder for copious jokes. But increasingly throughout its run, and particularly during its post-Season-3 incarnation on Hulu, “The Mindy Project” has specialized in bold, high-concept episodes that push its protagonist and audience to grapple with race, gender and class privilege.  “I think in earlier seasons of the show, Mindy Kaling wanted to just present a normal sitcom about dating, when she is sort of a nontraditional sitcom lead,” “Mindy” writer Lang Fisher told HuffPost. In the show creators’ eyes, Kaling taking on the role of an adorable rom-com lead, when she doesn’t resemble the typical tiny blonde American romantic heroine, constituted the show’s most potent political message. Not all critics saw it that way.  “When she did come under fire for being conventional and yada yada, I think that was upsetting because she’s not conventional. No one else looks like her on TV, particularly when this show started,” said Lang. “I think it was very hard for her to be criticized for that when many other shows with all-white casts were never criticized.” The show’s early treatments of race bear a whiff of defensiveness, or at least hyperawareness of its detractors. Barinholtz cowrote one of the first episodes that explicitly addressed race: “Mindy Lahiri Is a Racist,” which appeared in Season 2 ― after the show had been knocked around by critics of Mindy’s exclusively white male fellow doctors and romantic interests. “I remember in the writers room that summer, Mindy was like, let’s do a really really funny race episode,” he said. The result: An installment in which an expecting mother endorses Mindy’s practice on her white supremacist parenting blog, inspiring the crunchy liberal midwives in an adjoining office to lead an anti-racism crusade against them. It turns out that it’s being accused of racism that brings out the doctors’ worst impulses: Dr. Danny Castellano (Chris Messina) indignantly protests that (unlike Mindy) he’s dated many non-white people. Mindy thinks her own race precludes the possibility of her racism, even as she talks down to the practice’s black nurse, Tamra (Xosha Roquemore). “Sometimes you can get a little ‘Downton Abbey,’” Tamra points out.  Somehow, it’s fratty white doctor Peter (Adam Pally) who salvages the practice’s reputation ― he wants to start a mobile service to bring women’s healthcare to underserved communities. The episode teased out Mindy’s own deeply conservative (“she kind of notoriously thinks Chris Christie is right on,” said Barinholtz) and even racist tendencies. “I went to second base with my friend Korean Justin!” her character brags in front of a PR consultant brought in to fix the practice’s racist reputation. “His hands were so small, they made my boobs look enormous.” But the episode also highlights the hypocrisy of the virtue-signaling white liberals around her. “Sister Tamra, you work at Shulman & Associates,” one of the white, male midwives urges Tamra at a rally. “Tell us how much it’s like 1950s Birmingham.” He’s not so much offering her a chance to speak as he is pushing her to ventriloquize his own talking points. And while the episode lightly jabbed at critics who seemed to expect far more from her than her white showrunning peers, it also honestly and hilariously explored the problematic beliefs that lie behind the tolerant, egalitarian faces social progressives put out into the world. It turned out, though, that “The Mindy Project” had more to say about race ― on its own terms this time. Even as headlines about Mindy’s lily-white boyfriends were supplanted by hot takes on newer show, the sitcom was getting more pointed in its social commentary. The show was ready to expand its scope. “We’ve already made the point that she can have a conventional sitcom,” Fisher said. “So… what other points can she make as this character?” For one thing, the show is ready to get a little weird. “The Mindy Project” follows the romantic comedy model, right down to Mindy’s own conviction that she’s perpetually moments away from finding herself the star in a real-life iteration of the form. The show has always been littered with bizarre meet-cutes and dramatic confessions of long-festering love.  “We’ve paid homage to these different rom-com tropes, and we kind of have just wanted to have a little more fun with some of the weird ones, like the ‘Sliding Doors’ and ‘Groundhog Day,’” Fisher added. Sometimes the lessons are romantic ― forcing Mindy to relive one day until she understands what she did wrong to lead her boyfriend Ben to dump her ― but other times, those tropes are repurposed completely. In “Mindy Lahiri Is a White Man,” she’s passed over for a second interview for head of obstetrics at the hospital. All the second-round candidates are white men. Even though she eagerly assured the board ― in response to some truly horrifying and possibly illegal questions ― that she could balance the job with motherhood by working instead of exercising, and that she could keep her emotions in check to lead, she was ignored in favor of less-qualified male candidates. “I wish I was a white man,” she sighs before bed that night. And so she wakes up as a white man: Michael Lancaster, played by Ryan Hansen. Suddenly, her life is awesome. Michael’s ex takes care of their kids, and no one is worried that he can’t balance his role as a father with a demanding job. He can get ready for work and look professional in five minutes. He can pee standing up. Her coworkers listen to him respectfully and laugh at his jokes. Unfortunately for him, Michael can’t really enjoy all this privilege; he’s too aware of the flip side. After another doctor, Dr. Irene Lee, covers for a procedure while Michael is hungover, he realizes that quiet, self-effacing Dr. Lee is a supremely competent and qualified candidate for the head of obstetrics job. As an Indian-American woman, Mindy asked Dr. Lee not to sit near her in the waiting room so people wouldn’t think they were an “Asian clique”; as a white man, he feels thrilled to have the power to get his colleague noticed. Michael coaches his new friend on speaking confidently, grooming herself and dressing herself more attractively, and insists that the board give Dr. Lee a second interview.  Still, Dr. Lee doesn’t get the job ― in fact, the board tries to offer it to Michael, impressed with his dedication to diversity. Apparently it takes more than one woke white man to fix systemic injustice. “There’s a million great things about being a white guy, and that’s just counting the things you can do with your penis,” Michael/Mindy reflects that night. “But the sad thing is having the ability to help other people, and most of the time just not doing it. It’s just so easy not to. Your life is so carefree.” Unusually for a protagonist dealing with a body-switch scenario (see: “Freaky Friday” and “The Switch”), she’s realized that the other person’s life really is as amazing as it seemed to her. Nonetheless, she wants her life back ― despite the disadvantages, she realizes, she likes being an Indian woman. The episode explores how being a white man both is and isn’t a silver bullet ― even a white doctor who’s losing it mentally and may have killed his wife is more likely to get a management job than an Asian-American woman (after all, his late spouse was “a difficult woman”). But a white man can’t fix oppression with the force of his convictions; it takes more work than that. Plus, it’s hard to remember to do the right thing when the world around you seems relatively pleasant and welcoming. Ultimately Mindy takes a lesson away from the experience: She befriends Dr. Lee. Only hanging out with white men seemed safer, cloaking her with an aura of simultaneous chillness and importance in a way that being in an “Asian clique” wouldn’t. Now, she’s done playing that game; it didn’t work anyway. In many ways, as the show takes pains to uncover, Mindy’s problematic views come from a misguided desire to identify with society’s power brokers, to shine as the one worthy woman. She’s driven to be hot, stylish, popular, chill and successful, all in one package; to be Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, and the Gillian Flynn-esque Cool Girl. In another Season 5 episode, “Mindy Lahiri Is a Misogynist,” the male doctors at Shulman & Associates set out to hire another doctor ― a female one. Worried about losing her special spot as the only female doctor in the practice, Mindy tries to push a sweaty, sloppily dressed male doctor who has lost his medical school diploma as a superior choice.  “Mindy, every one of the female candidates was far more qualified than that walking MRSA infection,” Dr. Jeremy Reed (Ed Weeks) points out with withering calm. “Let’s face it: You’re kind of a misogynist.” A new doctor is hired ― Anna, a gorgeous, chilly blonde ― and Mindy immediately clashes with her new competition, noting in a burgeoning rage that her devoted fan Morgan has already begun sucking up to the new woman doctor. When Mindy misses an appointment, Anna takes her favorite patient; Mindy’s supposedly egalitarian male colleagues snicker over the “catfight” between the two. By the end of the episode, she realizes that she’s only jostling with Anna because the patriarchy has socialized her to do so. “I was raised in a system, created by men, that has pitted women against each other,” she proclaims. (You could imagine this Mindy flaunting a brightly colored “The Future Is Female” T-shirt.) She decides to forge a consciously feminist but tenuous peace with the new doctor. It’s not a friendship, but a small, determined step toward smashing the patriarchy. In “Mindy Lahiri Is a Racist,” she goes one step further: Not only is cutting down other women selfish and wrong, she realizes, it’s painfully clear that taking the side of white men didn’t offer her the status she thought it might. All it accomplished was cutting her off from having a support system of other women like her. Barinholtz told HuffPost that the show tries to avoid “coming off preachy” when incorporating more serious issues into storylines. “I think that’s kind of the death of a sitcom,” he said. But Mindy’s awakening isn’t always subtle. Sometimes, if not most of the time, there are monologues. Mindy’s speech apologizing for mistreating her female colleague is perhaps the least subtle approach to a pro-feminist monologue possible. “I was taught to believe that men can only handle one woman at a time,” she declares. “So it’s not my fault that I was threatened by Anna. It’s the fault of the patriarchy.”   It’s impossible to miss and difficult to misconstrue the point the show is trying to make when Mindy delivers the moral; the humor comes mostly from hearing moral preaching from a character who is gleefully shallow, politically incorrect and often selfish. “The fact that she is on the wrong side of the issue is what’s surprising and kind of funny about her as a character,” said Fisher. “The moral is always correct, even if she has a hard time getting around to it.” The essential flavor of the show has remained unchanged, despite its more serious bent. “I think the character is such a deeply ingrained creation of Mindy Kaling that it’s hard for her not to be consistent,” Fisher told HuffPost. “We all have absorbed that character in our bones at this point.” Season 5 of “The Mindy Project” opened with a typically flippant joke: The premiere episode dropped in the midst of election season, and was titled “Decision 2016.” It was about Mindy’s decision between two hot, white male love interests. The show barely touched the election, though other politically minded sitcoms did. Outside of the show, Barinholtz has suggested Mindy Lahiri might be a Trump voter ― and what about Morgan?  “I could see him getting very easily fleeced by Jill Stein,” he suggested. “I could see him writing in someone, writing in, like, Cesar Millan, the Dog Whisperer.” After five seasons, “The Mindy Project” has never been more well-positioned to take on Trump-era politics. But how can the show make that funny? “Honestly… it’s just so sad,” said Barinholtz. “I think we had a joke last year where [Jody] was like, ‘And for the record, I think Donald Trump would be fun as president.’ That joke worked in like, October of 2016. In March or April of 2017, we’re seeing just how much has changed.”  It’s not just the political context; the show has changed too. Perhaps making the Trump presidency funny in a sitcom universe is impossible, but “The Mindy Project” has a good shot. You can be highbrow. You can be lowbrow. But can you ever just be brow?

BUSINESS,"TalentSmart has conducted research with more than a million people, and we’ve found that the best bosses have a lot in common. In particular, 90% of them are skilled at managing their emotions in order to stay focused, calm, and productive. These folks have high emotional intelligence (EQ), a skill set that’s critical to achieving your dreams. It also happens to make them great to work for. It’s through a leader’s actions—what he or she does and says on a daily basis—that the essence of great leadership becomes apparent. Behavior can change, and leaders who work to improve themselves get results. While I’ve run across numerous effective strategies that great bosses employ, what follows are ten of the best. Some of these may seem obvious, but the real challenge lies in recognizing when you need to use them and having the wherewithal to actually do so. 1. They’re Composed Great bosses are composed because they constantly monitor their emotions, they understand them, and they use this knowledge in the moment to react to challenging situations with self-control. When things go downhill, they are persistently calm and frustratingly content (frustrating to those who aren’t, at least). They know that no matter how good or bad things get, everything changes with time. All they can do is adapt and adjust to stay happy and in control. 2. They’re Graceful Graceful people are the perfect combination of strong and gentle. They don’t resort to intimidation, anger, or manipulation to get a point across because their gentle, self-assured nature gets the job done. The word gentle often carries a negative connotation (especially in the workplace), but in reality, it’s the gentleness of being graceful that gives ultra successful leaders their power. They’re approachable, likeable, and easy to get along with—all qualities that make people highly amenable to their ideas. 3. They’re Knowledgeable Great bosses know more than others do because they’re constantly working to increase their self-awareness. They vow constant growth. Whenever they have a spare moment, they fill it with self-education. They don’t do this because it’s “the right thing to do”; they do it because it’s their passion. They’re always looking for opportunities to improve and new things to learn about themselves and the world around them. Instead of succumbing to their fear of looking stupid, truly exceptional people just ask the questions on their mind, because they would rather learn something new than appear smart. 4. They’re Honest Great bosses trust that honesty and integrity, though painful at times, always work out for the best in the long run. They know that honesty allows for genuine connections with people in a way that dishonesty can’t and that lying always comes back to bite you in the end. In fact, a Notre Dame study showed that people who often lied experienced more mental health problems than their more honest counterparts. 5. They’re Deliberate Great bosses reach decisions by thinking things out, seeking advice from others, and sleeping on it. They know that (as studies show) impulsively relying too much on gut-instinct is ineffective and misleading. Being able to slow down and logically think things through makes all the difference. 6. They Speak with Certainty It’s rare to hear great bosses utter things like “Um,” “I’m not sure,” and “I think.” Successful leaders speak assertively because they know that it’s difficult to get people to listen to you if you can’t deliver your ideas with conviction. 7. They Use Positive Body Language Becoming cognizant of your gestures, expressions, and tone of voice (and making certain they’re positive) draws people to you like ants to a picnic. Using an enthusiastic tone, uncrossing your arms, maintaining eye contact, and leaning towards the person who’s speaking are all forms of positive body language that super successful people use to draw others in. Positive body language makes all the difference in a conversation because how you say something can be more important than what you say. 8. They're Confident Successful leaders like to challenge themselves and compete, even when their efforts yield only small victories. Small victories build new androgen receptors in the areas of the brain responsible for reward and motivation. The increase in androgen receptors increases the influence of testosterone, which further increases their confidence and eagerness to tackle future challenges. When you achieve a series of small victories, the boost in your confidence can last for months. 9. They’re Fearless Fear is nothing more than a lingering emotion that’s fueled by your imagination. Danger is real. It’s the uncomfortable rush of adrenaline you get when you almost step in front of a bus. Fear is a choice. Exceptional leaders know this better than anyone does, so they flip fear on its head. Instead of letting fear take over, they are addicted to the euphoric feeling they get from conquering their fears. 10. They’re Grateful Ultra successful leaders know that it took a lot of ambition, passion, and hard work to get where they are in life. They also know that their mentors, colleagues, families, and friends all played a huge role in their success. Instead of basking in the glory of achievement, these leaders recognize others for the wonderful things they’ve done for them. Bringing It All Together These habits can make any of us more successful if we use them every day. Give them a try and see where they take you.

POLITICS,"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has reinstated one its employees after suspending her last month following reports that she shared numerous bigoted memes in 2016 and 2017. Ximena Barreto, who was appointed to be the department’s deputy director of communications in December 2017, was placed on administrative leave while the agency conducted a review of her social media accounts. With the review complete, Barreto has been permitted to return to work in a role outside of the public affairs office, an HHS official told HuffPost. The department has not received any complaints related to Barreto’s conduct during her tenure, the official said. Barreto apologized in a statement for making what she termed “emotionally-charged comments,” as first reported by CNN on Tuesday. “In the heated and hyper-passionate political campaign environment, I made generalized comments regarding race relations & radical Islam,” Barreto said. “I fully understand that these emotionally-charged comments were hurtful, & I deeply apologize to members of both communities.” “I love America and its people,” she added in the statement. “I have many, many friends of all races and religions, and I look forward to working hand-in hand with them all as we labor to improve our nation for future generations. America is the land of opportunity, I hope for the opportunity of understanding and forgiveness.” HHS suspended Barreto after progressive media watchdog Media Matters reported on offensive social media posts she shared as a fringe right-wing political commentator before her appointment to the agency. Using the screen name “RepublicanChick” on her personal website and social media accounts, Barreto repeatedly attacked Islam, calling the religion a “cult” that has “no place” in the U.S. She also peddled the “Pizzagate” and Seth Rich conspiracy theories. In May 2017, she retweeted an image saying that America’s forefathers would have “hung” former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for treason. Roughly three months later, she shared an image of Obama labeled as a “Muslim terrorist.” As noted by CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski, the department’s statement did not address Barreto’s social media posts on conspiracy theories or Obama being “hung.” Other Trump administration officials have left their positions after media outlets combed through their social media accounts. Todd Johnson, a former aide to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, resigned as a Defense Department staffer after CNN reported on his past racist and Islamophobic posts. In September 2017, William C. Bradford resigned as the head of the Department of Energy’s Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs after racist and anti-Semitic tweets he shared in 2016 surfaced. This article has been updated with additional information from the HHS official and from Barreto’s statement. "
POLITICS,"HANOI, Vietnam ― There was a time, a little over two years ago, when Ted Osius could imagine the smog clearing over this sprawling capital city, with its jungle canopy of ancient banyan trees and electrical wires alive with coal-fired power and its throngs of exhaust-coughing motorbikes. Osius, who abruptly resigned late last year after three years as the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, now warns that the Trump administration’s retreat on climate change is encouraging Vietnam to dig in on coal power. Doing so would undermine years of progress in a country that, with 2,026 miles of coastline on its mainland alone, risks becoming a poster child for the effects of rising sea levels. “The United States used to play a really useful role in influencing the Vietnamese to make good clean-energy decisions,” Osius told HuffPost this month in one of his first interviews since quitting in protest over a new White House policy to deport Vietnamese refugees. “Apparently the United States government no longer focuses on policy decision-making that’s influenced by sound science,” he added. “That makes it harder to make the case to other countries that they ought to make decisions based on sound science.” Nearly a year after President Donald Trump announced plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords, Vietnam has effectively become a canary in the coal mine for how closely other nations will stick to the global agreement’s goals as the U.S. abandons them.  Vietnam is under pressure, attempting to balance rapidly increasing energy demands with growing concerns over climate change ― and it’s finding a generous coal-friendly patron in China. The Southeast Asian country began rapidly building up its coal-fired power capacity in 2011 as it transformed itself into a manufacturing hub and outgrew its hydropower resources. Back in its first major national plan for energy development, the country had aimed to increase its coal power generation by 75,000 megawatts by 2030. During the final years of the Obama administration, however, the U.S. urged Vietnam to pursue renewable energy and cleaner-burning natural gas instead. Vietnam enthusiastically signed onto the Paris Agreement in April 2016 and since then has received roughly $40.5 million in aid from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s Green Climate Fund. In response, Vietnam reduced the planned construction of new coal-fired infrastructure by 20,000 megawatts and increased renewable energy projects by 14,000 megawatts. The country already operates more than 20 coal plants with a total capacity of 13,000 megawatts, accounting for one-third of the national power mix, according to a March report from Vietnam Investment Review. The U.S. wasn’t the only clean-energy influence. The government faced internal pressure to shift away from coal. Last month, Khanh Ngụy Thị, founder of the Vietnamese nonprofit Green Innovation and Development Centre, won the 2018 Goldman Environmental Prize, the so-called “green Oscar,” for her work convincing state agencies to increase use of renewable energy. But even after scaling back its plans, Vietnam was still set to triple the number of coal plants by 2030, increasing capacity to more than 55,000 megawatts. Coal power would comprise 42.6 percent of electrical production. Now, energy and environment experts worry that the country’s next national power development plan, which is being written this year, could hold to those figures or, worse, embrace a more aggressive coal strategy. The Trump administration has offered some positive language to those pushing for clean energy. In a joint statement issued with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc last May, the White House “affirmed its assistance to Vietnam in combating climate change via concrete mitigation and adaptation measures.” The administration repeated a similar line in November, after a meeting with Vietnamese President Trần Đại Quang. The U.S. Agency for International Development is continuing to fund projects in the Mekong and Red River deltas. But perhaps more significantly, the White House has proposed slashing the USAID budget by 33 percent. “Apparently there have been some fluctuations in funding from one year to the next,” a USAID spokesman said in an email, noting that the delta projects have continued so far. He did not respond to questions about the funding for those individual programs, and they were not itemized on the State Department’s budget justification in February. President Trump has pushed to scale back regulations on coal in the U.S. and made pitching the fuel a top priority at the annual United Nations climate conference. In one of his first moves as president, he pulled the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multi-nation trade deal that, despite drawing criticism from environmental groups, was expected to drive down the costs of renewable energy in developing countries. Last June, he announced plans to withdraw from the Paris accord and curtailed all U.S. payments to the Green Climate Fund. This year, he named a new secretary of state: Mike Pompeo, a vigorous climate change denier who, as a congressman, made repeated attempts to cripple funding for renewable energy projects. In short, the Trump administration seems unlikely to apply any real pressure on other countries to pursue clean energy or combat climate change. “When we stopped leading on climate change, that made it a heck of a lot easier for people to proceed with business-as-usual policies,” Osius said. For Vietnam, that means modeling itself on China, the world’s biggest source of climate-altering pollution. Vietnam’s ruling Communist Party transformed the country into one of the continent’s fastest-growing economies by following in China’s footsteps, becoming a magnet for textile, chemical and electronics manufacturing as its giant neighbor increased wages and environmental regulations. Mechanisms like the Green Climate Fund were meant to help countries such as Vietnam leapfrog the most pollution-prone stage of economic development by building up wind, solar and energy efficient infrastructure instead of coal-fired power plants ― something China did not do. “We are supposed to be the big counterweight to China,” said Virginia B. Foote, chief executive of Bay Global Strategies, an energy-focused government relations consultancy based in Hanoi. Now Vietnam is “just going to listen to the big bully to the north, and there’s no counter-bully to listen to at all.” Vietnam’s energy needs are growing. The country’s industrial south suffers frequent power outages, relying on a grid so fragile that a crane operator’s accident plunged 22 of 63 provinces into darkness for 10 hours in May 2013. Vietnam’s state-owned utility, EVN, began burning more diesel to meet the country’s energy needs last year and said it would likely increase use of the fuel from 2018 to 2019. Despite this, the Vietnamese enjoy low energy costs, particularly in the north, where most of the country’s coal mining takes place. The average price of electricity comes to about 7.5 cents per kilowatt-hour ― far below even that in Louisiana, the cheapest state in the U.S., where residents pay nearly 9 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the latest Energy Information Administration figures. “Politically, it’s understandable,” Foote said. “Everybody loves having cheap power, though it leads to waste and lack of incorporating clean technology.” The prices in Vietnam fail to factor in the steep societal costs of increased coal burning. A 2015 Harvard University study found that 4,300 Vietnamese die prematurely each year as a result of coal pollution ― a figure that could increase to as much as 25,000 per year under a more aggressive coal buildup. The state-owned utility operates as a nationwide monopoly, forcing proposals on electricity development to navigate a labyrinthine bureaucracy. The current low rates make any tweaks to the existing model a difficult sell. The template that EVN released last year for power purchase agreements on renewable energy was panned by investors as “unbankable,” meaning it posed too much risk to private companies. “[F]ew reputable financiers would be likely to sign up,” Giles Cooper, co-general director of the Ho Chi Minh City-based law office Duane Morris Vietnam, wrote in a blog post in October, concluding that the “final text does little to inspire confidence.” Officials at the Vietnamese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. Vietnam has, however, found a steady stream of suitors to finance its coal infrastructure. As of last December, foreign investors funded new Vietnamese coal projects to the tune of more than $16 billion. Of that, Chinese investments, funneled through that country’s biggest state-owned commercial banks, made up 50 percent, followed by Japan’s 23 percent and South Korea’s 18 percent. Vnesheconombank, a Russian financial entity, is backing the controversial Long Phu 1 power plant under construction in Soc Trang Province. In February, PetroVietnam, the state-owned Vietnamese company building the Long Phu 1 plant, withdrew its application for U.S. financial support, ending what was widely seen as the first major test of whether the Trump administration would use the Export-Import Bank of the United States to support a project that exacerbated climate change. Hanoi enjoyed just 38 days of clean air last year as air pollution surged to levels four times higher than those deemed acceptable under World Health Association guidelines, according to a January report from the Green Innovation and Development Centre. That makes Hanoi’s pollution worse than that of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta and puts it close to notoriously smog-choked Beijing. “Now, when it comes to climate, our government’s head is in the sand,” Osius said. “That means countries are going to have to fend for themselves a lot more.”"
BUSINESS,"Uber released the results of a three-month independent investigation on Tuesday, pulling back the curtain on a work culture former employees have described as toxic and indifferent to sexual harassment. In a 13-page document, report authors from the law firm Covington & Burling LLP issue recommendations they categorize into 10 distinct groups, including “changes to senior leadership” and “improvements to human resources and the complaint process.” In its section on senior leadership, the report calls for “reallocating” the responsibilities of CEO Travis Kalanick, as well as using regular performance reviews and set metrics to increase the accountability of other senior leaders. Kalanick announced separately on Tuesday that he would take a leave of absence from the company to grieve for his mother, who died in a boating accident late last month.  At the report’s recommendation, an independent board member has also joined Uber’s board to aid with company oversight. One section calls for a “reformulation” of Uber’s cultural values to emphasize inclusivity and positive behaviors like “mutual respect.” These values would ideally replace its current ones ― including “Let Builders Build” and “Always Be Hustlin’” ― which the report concludes have “been used to justify poor behavior.” In addition to such recommendations as having more trainings, improving the human resources and complaint processes, introducing a better system for record-keeping and boosting diversity, the report made clear, actionable suggestions for employee practices. In particular: Prohibiting intimate or otherwise romantic relationships between employees in a chain of command. Updating its employment policies to clarify and strengthen it stance against discrimination and harassment. Clarifying and limiting the consumption of alcohol and other controlled substances during work hours and at work events. Letting employees more easily transfer internally from one job to another. Restoring employee trust in performance reviews by increasing transparency and setting specific targets. Clarifying the process by which promotions are awarded. Former Attorney General Eric Holder and colleague Tammy Albarrán, who led the investigation, presented the full report to the board Sunday. Its members voted unanimously to adopt all of the report’s recommendations. Uber commissioned the report in February, after a former engineer named Susan Fowler recounted her nightmarish experiences at the company ― including being propositioned for sex by a male manager ― in a scathing 3,000-word blog post. Fowler said the human resources department at Uber punished her for alerting the company to the overt, repeated instances of sexual harassment, telling her to either find a new work team or accept negative performance reviews in the future. Kalanick responded to Fowler’s blog by calling for an “urgent investigation.”  “We seek to make Uber a just workplace FOR EVERYONE,” he wrote in a statement sent to HuffPost at the time, “and there can be absolutely no place for this kind of behavior at Uber ― and anyone who behaves this way or thinks this is OK will be fired.” Chief Human Resources Officer Liane Hornsey pledged on Tuesday to implement the report’s findings, but acknowledged that “change does not happen overnight.” “Implementing these recommendations will improve our culture, promote fairness and accountability, and establish processes and systems to ensure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated,” Hornsey said in a statement. “While change does not happen overnight, we’re committed to rebuilding trust with our employees, riders and drivers.” The report was originally expected at the end of April, but the deadline was extended through May as Holder said he required more time to interview everyone involved. A subcommittee of Uber board members, including former HuffPost editor-in-chief Arianna Huffington, have received weekly updates throughout the process.  “Change doesn’t usually happen without a catalyst,” Huffington wrote in February, explaining the need for an inquiry. “I hope that by taking the time to understand what’s gone wrong and fixing it we can not only make Uber better but also contribute to improvements for women across the industry.” Fowler’s blog post was among the first revelations in what ultimately would become a long string of damaging news stories for Uber. Since February, the company has found itself entangled in a potentially disastrous lawsuit brought by rival Waymo concerning allegedly stolen technology; a criminal probe over software it built to evade authorities; the departure of numerous high-profile executives (including both its communications head and president); and controversy after a video of Kalanick cursing out an Uber driver went viral."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Even Deadpool has some limits.  Actor Ryan Reynolds, co-writer and star of the upcoming “Deadpool 2,” said there was one joke he wasn’t allowed to make. “This is a sore spot for me because there’s a joke in the movie that is not in the movie now because ― I’m probably not even allowed to say this ― Fox made me take it out,” Reynolds told Entertainment Weekly. “It had more to do with Disney, and they made me take it out. As I look back at it, I think maybe that was a wise decision.” Disney wasn’t completely off-limits. There is a recurring joke about “Frozen” in the film, EW reported. Disney was in negotiations to purchase most of Fox at the time “Deadpool 2” was in development, which may have played a role in the orders delivered by the studio. While Deadpool belongs to Disney-owned Marvel, licensing arrangements that predate Disney’s 2009 purchase of the comic company placed the film rights to certain characters in the control of other companies. In this case, Fox had control over Deadpool on the big screen.  Late last year, Disney reached a deal to purchase much of Fox. The deal is expected to close next year. "
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― When the pre-election payment from President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer to porn actress Stormy Daniels not to discuss the affair she says she had with him first came to light, the figure cited was $130,000. Weeks later, as Trump’s latest lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, finally acknowledged that Trump was aware of Michael Cohen’s payment and had repaid him for it, Giuliani cited $35,000 monthly payments over the course of a year ― or $420,000. And on Wednesday, when Trump for the first time acknowledged the payment on his financial disclosure form, it was characterized as a “reimbursement” of “expenses” that Cohen incurred in 2016, with a value between $100,000 and $250,000. So what’s going on? Why did Trump pay Cohen $420,000 for a $130,000 expense? That remains unclear. Giuliani, in several interviews with HuffPost over the course of a week, explained that Trump also paid enough to cover all the taxes Cohen would have had to pay to have been left with $130,000 ― the original sum he paid out of his own pocket. Giuliani estimated that this added another $70,000, plus some profit for Cohen, plus some other expenses. What other expenses? “That’s privileged,” Giuliani said. Kathleen Clark, a professor of legal ethics at Washington University, began laughing as she listened to a summary of Giuliani’s explanations. “It seems nonsensical, because it is nonsensical,” she said. Both Trump and his White House had claimed for months that Trump knew nothing about Cohen’s payment to Daniels. Those statements, though, were proven false when Giuliani began explaining last month that Trump had repaid Cohen. Giuliani was emphasizing that because Trump repaid Cohen, the $130,000 could not be construed as a campaign finance law violation, as candidates are permitted to spend as much as they want on their own races. Because Trump had not disclosed his debt to Cohen on the financial disclosure form he filed last June, the Office of Government Ethics referred his failure to do so to the Justice Department on Wednesday, when Trump belatedly revealed that payment on this year’s form. “Knowingly and willfully” withholding that information on that form is punishable by as much as a year in jail, per federal statute. Giuliani said Trump was under no obligation to report the payments to Cohen to repay Daniels ― “There’s no place on the form to disclose it” ― but said he advised Trump to do it anyway, as he anticipated that OGE officials would argue it should be disclosed. He insisted that the payment to Daniels was entirely normal, something done all the time by famous people wanting nuisances to go away. “This is a perfectly legitimate thing. There’s nothing wrong with it,” he said. Other lawyers, though, said that Cohen’s use of a newly created shell company to pay Daniels suggested otherwise. “This whole thing is highly suspicious, highly unusual,” said a lawyer with two decades of experience in business law who spoke on condition of anonymity. “I’d be very reluctant to be involved in anything like this.” Another lawyer familiar with nondisclosure agreements who spoke on condition of anonymity had a simple explanation for Giuliani’s contortions: “Paying hush money to porn stars is not a legitimate business expense.” But technically, the nondisclosure agreement was a standard services contract ― except that in this case, Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was being paid for the service of remaining silent. That payment from Trump to Clifford via Cohen would clearly be a business expense for Cohen, and therefore not taxable income, said a Washington, D.C., tax lawyer, also on condition of anonymity. “That’s not your money. That’s not income to you,” the lawyer said. “I disagree with Giuliani’s characterization of this. I don’t see why it would have to be out of after-tax earnings.” In any event, Trump’s payment to Cohen of close to half a million dollars still makes no sense, Clark said, if it was to reimburse Cohen for a payment to Daniels that was less than one-third that amount. “What Giuliani seems to be acknowledging is that this was not the only hush payment,” she said. “There’s no other way to make the math work.” Michael Avenatti, Daniels’ new lawyer who is trying to invalidate the 2016 “hush agreement” in court, told NBC News on Thursday that he is researching the stories of two other women who have come to him claiming they have similar agreements with Trump negotiated by Cohen. Giuliani himself allowed that possibility in an ABC News interview last month, saying that while he did not have knowledge of other women who might have been paid off, Cohen would have done that “if it was necessary.” Late Wednesday, he would not say if he’d yet learned the nature of those other expenses ― “none of which are my concern or yours,” he said. He reiterated that the Daniels payment was not a campaign expense that needed to be reported. He acknowledged that keeping Daniels out of the news in the days leading up to the election was helpful to Trump’s campaign, but he said it benefited the campaign in the same way, for example, that a new suit that Trump bought to wear during a debate might have. “This payment would have been made in any event,” he said. “It’s not a campaign expense. It would have been made at any other time to protect his family and his reputation.” Giuliani did say, however, that his earlier belief that Trump had sought to pay for Cohen’s taxes on the $130,000 was incorrect. He said the repayment was for $130,000 exactly, and no more. “I was wrong about it,” he said."
BUSINESS,"Let’s go to Denmark. The tiny little fairytale country in calm and quite Scandinavia. When a small country like that suddenly needs a public counsel for disruption and an ambassador to technology companies it makes sense. It’s just like any company should have a R&D team and a highly ranked person championing the digital and technological challenges and possibilities. Because it’s long since we all began to live and breathe digital services like Facebook and worship products as our iPhone. We work all day long in the world of Google, buying our stuff through Amazon, watching Netflix and chilling when traveling to those Airbnb apartments that we get to on the backseats of Uber rides while listening to music from Spotify. Those are all companies that utilize exponential technologies reaching almost infinite numbers of people with their ingenuity and create value in a more future-oriented way. And a very Silicon Valley-like way. But can this model for innovation and disruption be exported outside? Let’s stay in tiny Denmark for a while. Now they also have a franchise of the prominent Singularity University. The American concept has opened an office in Copenhagen in the form of a so-called innovation hub. At Singularity the mantra is to solve ‘humanity’s grand challenges’ with exponential technologies. And if there ever was anyone capable of staging the endless possibilities that comes with technology in a fascinating way it is Singularity. So that’s just great. You’ll need all the inspiration and aspiration there is to be innovative. So in this awesome fairytale country that gave the world Lego, Noma and Hans Christian Andersen they even have a special commission named Siri. Yes, very originally inspired by the artificial assistant from Silicon Valley juggernaut Apple. In other words; Denmark is ready for disruption, innovation and exponential growth. And Silicon Valley. But can you fit Silicon Valley into wonderful Copenhagen? Is it possible to copy the Silicon Valley recipe for a radically different environment? Be it Denmark or for that matter Berlin, London or Paris? It’s a bit like trying to recreate your grandmother’s secret recipe for tartlets. You’ll never come close to that magical feeling from childhood. And maybe that’s exactly the whole point. The world does not necessarily need more tartlets, but something completely new. And that is precisely what technology brings with it — new opportunities. Therefore it seems extremely uninspiring and uncreative to import a recipe no matter how wonderful it is in its original surroundings. that can put handling of the future in a formula and be disseminated to everyone and everything. In the Valley they call it scaling. And if there is something they invented more than anything else, it is probably the model of scaling. It’s both impressive and admirable. That’s why we all use their products. In Silicon Valley everything is being made under the banner of making the world a better place, and it works extremely well. So well there is a heavy pull towards that way of thinking in a lot of other countries. Just like the kind of cultural imperialism coming from out of Hollywood — when everything springs from the same, everything will also be soaked in the same culture and values. Development of ideas, design, language, business models, even the way to engage with the world, will be the same. But if we all have the same standpoint and starting point, it’s hard to bring anything new to the table. Which is needed in an increasingly competitive market. They know that very well in Silicon Valley. That’s why they have a strong tradition of obtaining patents. And that’s why they have a culture of promoting inventions as the genius of individuals. To protect and celebrate intellectual property and the original in order to incentivise creators. They also know the importance of being creative in China. Notably the Chinese way with an almost reversed approach. They’re not that concerned with the role of the individual in the creation of new. They also have a very relaxed approach to copying and mixing existing inventions in to new original combinations. The genius is not to invent the ingredients, but to put them together in new and creative ways. WeChat is a nice example of that. Here the Chinese owners aggressively mix and match a sea of ​​products that otherwise operate as independent businesses and services in the US and the more international market. You can compare the Chinese chat app with both the social layer of Facebook, user-to-user market as on eBay and the everything store of Amazon. You can also book tickets and taxis and set up bank loans and use it for payments. And of course you will also be able to find a new friend or lover through the app by shaking your phone. This is not to say which of the two philosophies is best. We will probably never know. And that’s exactly the point. The important thing is that they have found the models that works well in their own unique environment. And both models are especially suited to a world that has become unpredictable and therefore don’t reward reproduction of ideas, but rather the production of them. The Americans have found a way. The Chinese another. It would be innovative if the Denmarks of the world also found their a way where the ingredients come from the nearby environment and cultural traditions. Philosophical, ethical and humanistic intellectual issues are already causing a lot of discussions in governments, organisations and society. We as humans have to figure out where we’re headed and how we will deal with exponential technologies when the effects of exponentiality becomes clear. Not just in music, hotels, transportation or social networks. But in artificial intelligence, robotics and cyborgborgs. Now that’s an open market to conquer. And that will make the world a better place. The Old World of Europe should have an advantage in thinking and acting democracy, politics, philosophy and humanities with a healthy critical perspective. The whole point of innovation is to be innovative. And original. Also in your approach."
BUSINESS,"To put it mildly, Uber is the midst of an identity crisis right now. To name a few of its problems, CEO Travis Kalanick recently resigned, 20 workers were fired earlier this month amid sexual harassment allegations, and the Equal Rights Center is suing Uber for denying equal access to its services for people with disabilities. In order to successfully rebound from these (and other) missteps and regain public confidence Uber should hire a women CEO. Here’s why: Uber needs a good story to tell; hiring a highly qualified woman CEO is a good place to start.

ARTS & CULTURE,"An artist is giving President-elect Donald Trump’s most outrageous comments the comic book treatment. Cartoonist Robert Sikoryak is transforming several of the controversial and offensive statements that Trump made during the presidential election campaign into eye-catching and thought-provoking illustrations. “The idea occurred to me right before the election,” the New York City-based artist told The Huffington Post on Saturday.  “Trump had said so many outrageous things during his campaign that I wanted to catalogue them.” “It was important to me to only use Trump’s actual quotes, I didn’t want to put any words in his mouth,” he added. “Once Trump became the president-elect, I felt I had to do it.” Sikoryak’s work has previously appeared on the cover pages of The New Yorker magazine and the Harvard Business Review. He has also transformed Apple’s iTunes terms of service into comic parodies. For this project, titled “The Unquotable Trump,” he has compiled the images into a mini-comic. He’s also posting them on a dedicated Tumblr page. “The reaction has been very enthusiastic, much more so than I expected,” Sikoryak told HuffPost. “I needed to get these comics out of my system, so it’s gratifying that other people have been enjoying them.” Check out more of his Trump-themed comic book covers below and see his other work via his website, Facebook, Tumblr and Twitter accounts."
ARTS & CULTURE,"My dear friend Larry Payne mentioned that he had just purchased three watercolor paintings, so I arranged a visit to this exciting new artist's atelier. Based in Culver City, CA, Donna Quesada finds inspiration in nature. Towering over her home studio are two giant sycamore trees that she says are the sole survivors of what was once a line of 122 brothers and sisters. Intertwined among them now are various other plants and trees, such as palms, umbrellas and even banana trees.  Donna showed me her paintings and the first thing I noticed was that some of her exquisitely ornate watercolors had a slightly Asian feel. Donna said that she loves to work with a special Japanese ink called sumi-é, which she often uses alongside watercolor. It is the sumi-é that gives many of her pieces an eastern feel.  Here are four of my favorites:  I loved the black trees juxtaposed by the bright leaves in ""Yellow Autumn Trees."" It is simple yet dramatic and striking, immediately conveying the feeling of the changing season.  ""Pink Blowing Tree"" was another immediate favorite. If you look closely you can see layers of splattered paint in myriad colors bursting off of the canvas and making the painting feel dynamic and alive. I loved the paradoxical mood created by the dark ink background with the brightness of the sky and the tree. This is a very exciting painting.  With the sycamores above the studio, it is easy to see how ""Sycamore Tree"" came into fruition. The upward perspective was dizzying and enticing; it made me feel as if the tree was reaching towards the infinite.    With its subdued palette of earthy colors and speckled snow, ""Boy & Dog in the Snow"" is a vivid impression of a winter day in the woods.  For more information please visit www.DonnaQuesada.com"
ARTS & CULTURE,"When you compose an opera based on William Hogarth's famous and guardedly beloved series, The Rake's Progress, you build in a certain expectation. Spectators in large numbers will have the highly populated depictions of louche English 18th-century behavior in mind as they enter. They could assume that's what they'll be seeing. Jonathan Miller's 1997 production of The Rake's Progress, revived at the Metropolitan Opera House for the first time since 2003, and around for only two additional performances, eschews the look. As designed by Peter J. Davidson, it goes for something entirely different. The opening scene of a tall house with treetops for a roof, and standing against a blue sky with a couple stationary clouds, is reminiscent not of Hogarth, but of René Magritte. With the subsequent nine scenes and an epilogue presented in similar settings, the decadence that can almost be sniffed in the Hogarth images that inspired composer Igor Stravinsky and librettists W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman has been replaced by an antiseptic environment, this despite the stuffed animals decorating Tom Rakewell's swanky apartment. Even when the chorus members arrive in sequences that alternately conjure the 1950s, 1940s, 1930 and 1920, in that reverse chronological order, they appear more like stick figures than dissolute participants. (Judy Levin designed the costumes). The same goes for the asylum scene, which doesn't look too much, as it might have, like dingy Bedlam. It's one thing to update but another to contradict. But while the look of this Rake's Progress is at odds with Stravinsky's intentions -- unlike the David Hockney production, which modernizes Hogarth but doesn't dismiss him -- James Levine's conducting is surely what Stravinsky, who led the opera's1951 opening, would want. As the maestro always has, he honors the composer's neo-classical intentions throughout, so that the various predecessors to whom Stravinsky alludes -- Handel right off the bat(on) -- are heard crisply and with the proper Stravinsky jangle. The singing is strong, for the most part. As Tom, the roundish but thoroughly athletic Paul Appleby acquits himself well. Scampering about in the early sections and even leaping mercurially onto a table at one moment, he goes into the rake's decline impressively. Gerald Finley, bearded as Nick Shadow, gives an impeccable performance, none more so than when convincing Tom that he should defy all convention and marry Baba the Turk. (Why Tom doesn't twig to the menace of a character whose surname is Shadow is never explained, of course.) As Anne Trulove, Layla Claire has a few shrill moments when going for the high notes, but she, too, sings persuasively. (Why costumer Levin has dressed her for much of the action in a suit resembling a nun's contemporary dress, is another matter.) In his Met debut as Anne Trulove's censorious father, the bass Brindley Sherratt, makes a worthy impression. Stephanie Blythe, outrageously and hilariously garbed by Levin, is her usual glorious self. Whether she actually gets right the second-act aria in which she gabs at Tom to the point of his combustion isn't clear, but so what? The quartets and quintets are rendered effectively. Speaking of enunciation: It's known that Auden wasn't happy with the way Stravinsky set Kallman's and his libretto on the music. On the other hand, he knew that Kallman and he were handing his poetic handiwork over to Stravinsky. What did he think was going to happen? By the way, watching Nick Shadow whispering poisonous somethings into Tom Rakewell's ear is akin to observing Iago influencing Othello, or Otello and Mephistopheles misdirecting Faust. It's another absorbing instance of a literary and operatic theme: The id corrupting the ego.  Irresistible, isn't it?"
ARTS & CULTURE,"By Justin Quirk, April 7, 2015 A new show at Zurich's Migros Museum re-examines the work of Swiss artist Xanti Schawinsky, a European creative whose work is inextricably bound up with the chaotic period that he had the misfortune to be born into. The child of Polish Jewish parents, Schawinsky  worked briefly in architecture before enrolling at the Bauhaus in 1924. This immediately placed him shoulder to shoulder with those of his fellow students who would go on to exert such influence over visual culture, including Walter Gropius, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, and Josef Albers. During this time, Schawinsky experimented in the movement's theater and music departments, work that was later included in the original 1938 MoMA Bauhaus exhibition. While much of Schawinsky's time at the Bauhaus was a formative creative period, it also impressed upon him how inseparable art was from the political culture around it. During his tenure, the Bauhaus was pressured, marginalized, stripped of its leaders and eventually shut down. In 1936 - thanks to Josef Albers - Schawinsky and his wife secured safe passage to America, originally for a teaching post in North Carolina, then to New York where he reunited with Gropius and other Bauhaus luminaries. There he perfected his ""Spectodrama"" pieces, early version of countercultural happenings, bringing space, light, sound and color together. Schawinsky went on to produce a body of visual work that still looks remarkably fresh. It has the clean, formal discipline that gives away his architectural training, but with a sense - thanks to comic touches, surreal flashes and experimentation - of an artist constantly pushing at the boundaries of genre. Cut-outs, optical tricks, the repurposing of brand identities and early mechanical graphic treatments: all contribute to work which manages to be genuinely avant-garde without snobbishly pushing the viewer away. Schawinsky deserves to be a better known name, both in art and also in the world of graphic identity which now permeates almost all aspects of modern life.  Xanti Schawinsky is on view at the Migros Museum in Zurich through May 17, 2015. --Justin Quirk is an ARTPHAIRE contributor, and the Editorial Director of HOUSE magazine, as well as a contributor to The Guardian, Esquire, Shortlist, Stylist, Grazia and The Sunday Telegraph.

BUSINESS,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation has arrested a Volkswagen AG executive on charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States, the New York Times reported on Monday. Oliver Schmidt, who headed the company’s regulatory compliance office in the U.S. from 2014 to March 2015, was arrested on Saturday by federal investigators in Florida, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter. VW admitted in September 2015 to installing secret software known as “defeat devices” in 475,000 U.S. 2.0-liter diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and make them appear cleaner in testing. In reality, the vehicles emitted up to 40 times the legally allowable pollution levels. Volkswagen declined to comment on the reported arrest. “Volkswagen continues to cooperate with the Department of Justice as we work to resolve remaining matters in the United States. It would not be appropriate to comment on any ongoing investigations or to discuss personnel matters,” it said. The FBI was not immediately available for comment. Schmidt is expected to be brought before court in Detroit on Monday, the NYT said. Senior VW officials are not attending this year’s Detroit auto show, which is taking place this week. The news comes as Volkswagen was nearing a deal to resolve criminal and civil allegations over its diesel cheating, crucial steps toward moving past the scandal, which has cost it billions of dollars and its reputation. Volkswagen shares were up 2 percent at 141.75 euros by 3.16 a.m. ET, at the top of a 0.2 percent-weaker German blue-chip DAX .GDAXI, on the expected deal.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Your intrepid reporter has traveled far and wide to see opera before, but this was his most challenging assignment yet: to venture into deepest, darkest Manhattan, find parking that didn't require a second mortgage and see the new Broadway play featuring dear Renée Fleming, Living on Love. For comps your reporter will subject himself to any indignity (opera company marketing and PR departments take note), so off he went. And he didn't regret a minute of it. Of course this whole play is about Renée Fleming, so at this point I must pause to lavish her with praise. The part of Raquel De Angelis is perfect for Miss Fleming, who delighted in portraying the egotism, the false modesty, the brash assurance of the Diva, as she is called by everyone. The moments when she revealed the true Raquel, insecurities and all, were handled skillfully, although at times one suspected the character was using even those moments to manipulate people. In spite of one or two bumpy transitions from the grandiloquent Diva to the genuine Raquel, one was left entirely satisfied by Miss Fleming's portrayal of the Diva. With the stage set just so, the rest of the story is no surprise. But that's not important. As the Diva explains, recalling a very young fan's comment, people go to the opera because it's better than life. So it is with the theater. The intricately choreographed efficiency of the two butlers (played by with great joy by Blake Hammond and Scott Robertson) was a delight, both in changing scenes and in their condescending interaction with the two young writers. When they sang along with the opera recordings that accompanied the scene changes -- quite well, I might add -- it was amusing and quite charming. Their lounge-act performance of ""Makin' Whoopie"" as they were setting the stage for the the Diva's and the Maestro's grandest attempts to seduce the two ghost writers was a delight. Kudos to director Kathleen Marshall for a thousand delightful details. Kudos also to the spectacular design team:  costume design by Michael Krass, scene design by Derek McLane, wig and hair by Tom Watson. The Eisenhower-era costumes and wigs were absolutely stunning.  One of the most touching details is the story of how the Maestro and the Diva met. Seated next to each other at a sidewalk cafe in Vienna, they both delighted in a small boy performing the Irving Berlin song ""Always"" on his tiny violin. They asked for another song, but the lad claimed to know no more songs, so he played ""Always"" again and again, and soon young Vito and Raquel were in love. The Maestro has never been able to progress beyond this story with any of his ghost writers, and at the end, it is instrumental in the Maestro and the Diva reaffirming their love. Miss Fleming's sweet performance of this song almost brought a tear to your hardened reporter's eye. That is how the play ended, and that is how this review ends -- with an image of the Diva in the Maestro's arms, singing sweet, romantic songs to him."

ARTS & CULTURE,"Multiple women have accused Broadway star Ben Vereen of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to assault, according to a Friday morning report from the New York Daily News. The alleged sexual misconduct happened during Vereen’s tenure as director of the 2015 production of “Hair” at the Venice Theatre program outside of Tampa, Florida. Vereen, who was 69 at the time, held open auditions for the production and later managed the 32-person volunteer cast. Four female cast members told the New York Daily News that Vereen repeatedly and forcibly kissed and hugged them without their consent. Several other cast members corroborated their experiences, telling the New York Daily News that Vereen routinely made degrading comments about female cast members’ bodies during rehearsals and one time stripped naked with the cast during what he called an acting exercise.  Two of the four women alleged that Vereen invited them separately over to his home in September 2015 for “private rehearsals.” During these two incidences, Vereen allegedly coerced the women into getting naked and asked them to join him in the hot tub. According to the two accounts, Vereen pressed his erect penis into the women’s legs and made unwanted sexual advances.  “He was acting as my mentor, asking me about my parents, then that same night, he put me on his lap while I was crying, and I felt his erection,” Kaitlyn Terpstra, who was 22 at the time, told the New York Daily News.  “He asked me, ‘Feel that?’ It was terrifying. I said, ‘Feel what?’ I wanted to act like I didn’t. I pushed myself off with a laugh,” she continued. “Then later, he asked, ‘Do you think I want to fuck you?’ I said ‘Yes,’ and he got angry. He said, ‘Well, I don’t, and that’s unfortunate.’ He made me feel like I had my mind in the gutter.” The other woman, identified only as “Kim,” told the New York Daily News Vereen asked her to perform oral sex while they were in his hot tub. Kim, who was only 23 at the time, said she acquiesced and recalled feeling “confused.” “I didn’t feel like I had a choice,” she said. Kim said she willingly entered into a relationship with Vereen after that first encounter. Now, however, she believes it was because he manipulated and took advantage of her.  Vereen starred in the original Broadway production of “Hair” between 1968 and 1972, alternating between the roles of Claude and Hud. Many of the 2015 cast members (all of whom were volunteers looking to jumpstart their acting careers) said that they were in awe of Vereen’s iconic role and subsequent successful career, which made it easier for him to take advantage of them.    In a statement to HuffPost, Vereen did not deny the accusations and apologized for his actions: I would like to apologize directly to the female cast members of the musical Hair for my inappropriate conduct when I directed the production in 2015. While it was my intention to create an environment that replicated the themes of that musical during the rehearsal process, I have since come to understand that it is my conduct, not my intentions, which are relevant here. So I am not going to make any excuses because the only thing that matters here is acknowledging and apologizing for the effects of my conduct on the lives of these women. Going forward, my having come to terms with my past conduct will inform all my future interactions not only with women, but with all individuals. I hope these women will find it in their hearts to accept my sincere apology and forgive me. Murray Chase, executive director of the Venice Theatre, told New York Daily News that the theater is “working to strengthen our sexual harassment policies and procedures, including the reporting of them, to prevent any future occurrences.” "
BUSINESS,"Las Vegas mogul Steve Wynn has been accused of a decades-long pattern of sexual harassment and abuse toward workers at his casinos, according to an investigation by The Wall Street Journal. Dozens of current and former employees at Wynn’s gambling establishments told the Journal they had experienced or witnessed chronic abuse by the billionaire, who was named finance chairman for the Republican National Convention last year. The allegations range from lewd comments and inappropriate touching to soliciting sex acts from women who worked as manicurists and massage therapists at Wynn’s Las Vegas casinos. One former employee at Wynn Las Vegas said the mogul pressured her into having unwanted sex with him after she gave him a manicure in 2005. Wynn later agreed to pay the woman a $7.5 million settlement after she filed a report. “The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous,” Wynn said in a statement shared with HuffPost. “We find ourselves in a world where people can make allegations, regardless of the truth, and a person is left with the choice of weathering insulting publicity or engaging in multi-year lawsuits. It is deplorable for anyone to find themselves in this situation.” Wynn, who turns 76 on Saturday, went on to blame the allegations on his ex-wife, Elaine Wynn, who is suing him to lift restrictions preventing her from selling her stock in Wynn Resorts Limited. At one time a rival of fellow casino businessman Donald Trump, Wynn was appointed to head the RNC’s finance committee in January 2017. He has supported both the Democratic and Republican parties with financial contributions over the years. But Wynn threw his support behind the latter during the 2016 election cycle, donating some $833,000 to Republican joint fundraising, according to Forbes. The RNC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations against Wynn. A spokesperson for Wynn Resorts declined to comment on whether the businessman intends to step down from his role with the RNC. In a statement to HuffPost, the Wynn Resorts representative said the company is “committed to operating with the highest ethical standards and maintaining a safe and respectful culture.”  The spokesperson also noted that the company requires employees to receive annual anti-harassment training, and that it offers a hotline for employees to submit harassment claims anonymously. “Since the inception of the company, not one complaint was made to that hotline regarding Mr. Wynn,” the representative said. Current and former employees who spoke with the Journal said they were nervous about coming forward due to Wynn’s influence in the casino industry. Wynn is worth over $3.5 billion, by Forbes’ estimate. He owns two sprawling Las Vegas casinos ― the Wynn and Encore resorts ― as well as two other complexes in Macau. Another $2.4 billion Wynn casino is in construction in the Boston area. His power and influence, like those of other prominent men who have been accused of recurrent sexual abuse, may have led him to feel invincible in his own domain. Current and former employees told the Journal that Wynn would frequently walk around in short shorts with no underwear, exposing his genitals when he sat to receive a pedicure. He would proposition female employees in his private office and even allegedly asked a former executive to get him the phone numbers of casino cocktail waitresses. “Everybody was petrified,” said Jorgen Nielsen, a former artistic director at the resort’s on-site salon, who told the Journal that female employees would hide in bathrooms and back closets when they heard Wynn was approaching. One former employee who Wynn allegedly harassed told the Journal she tried to laugh off his advances. “I would say, ‘Oh Mr. Wynn,’” she recounted. “I was just trying to get on with my job.” This article has been updated with remarks from a Wynn Resorts representative."
BUSINESS,"While it’s really all too common to find a corporate crisis in the headlines on any day I walk into my classroom to teach graduate students about the value of authentic communications, yesterday’s United Airlines debacle was unfolding in real time at the start of class. So my graduate students and I decided that whatever lecture I might have had planned could wait. We projected Twitter onto the board and began to analyze comments in hopes of understanding what this dreadful incident could show us about how to handle a corporate crisis. And in the process we learned what a weak and disingenuous CEO statement can suggest about corporate values and culture. First, of course, we watched the hideous video. Seeing a man beaten and dragged from his seat, while shocked passengers wailed and videotaped from all angles, left us speechless for a moment. But as we watched the incident a second and third time—as most viewers will, we arrived at the inevitable question: How bad does the whole system at United have to be for things to spin this badly out of control, this fast? The answer, of course, was provided by United CEO Oscar Munoz himself in the form of a singularly bad public statement we found almost immediately on Twitter. Many of the organizational and cultural woes at United were right there for all to see, not just between the lines—but literally easily identified in every line of that statement. So what can the Munoz statement tell us? Wow. In poker, I believe they call this a “tell.” The first line is an opportunity to convey authenticity, empathy, leadership, and integrity. But not here. This opener suggests that, at least as far as Munoz is concerned, this incident is first and foremost distressing to everyone at United? Really? This may come as a bit of a shock to the innocent passenger who was the victim of the beating, to his fellow passengers who were traumatized by the attack, to the entire traveling public riveted by the viral video, and anyone on the planet with access to Twitter. Here’s the reality: Virtually no one in the audience at whom this statement is directed cares about how unsettling this event is for everyone at United. This opening line suggests an unwillingness to address victims of this incident—and might as well read, “We at United are primarily unsettled by bad publicity. Damn those cell phones with their video cameras.” A reasonable reader’s takeaway: If an event like this doesn’t cause some soul-searching at United, nothing will. I’m going to try to avoid United at all costs. Incredibly, with this line, the United CEO doubles down on his stubborn insistence that this incident is primarily about someone other than the passenger who was beaten. Apologizing to some other group of passengers doesn’t even remotely achieve the objective of redirecting our attention from the bloody face of that poor man; it only increases our realization that the CEO intends to misdirect rather than resolve. Indeed it also makes us more eager to know more about the victim, the broken operational system, and corporate culture that led to the attack. And neither does injecting a stilted, unhelpful verb like “re-accommodate,” redirect our attention from the storm troopers. If the first rule of a good communications strategy is authenticity, then the first sign of a truly bad one is having to dig deep into Merriam Webster for a verb that is supposed to sound vaguely official, but really suggests a desire for diversion and a lack of regard for the truth, not to mention an absence of empathy. A reasonable reader’s takeaway: United is either not sorry or not in control of the situation, as evidenced by this ‘re-accommodation’ red herring. After an incident like this, one of the only ways to rebuild trust is to insist on an independent and open inquiry to identify weaknesses in a system that broke down so completely. There is no real sense here that accountability or transparency are of great importance; rather the focus on “our own detailed review” suggests that United thinks it may be qualified to get to the bottom of the situation on its own. Clearly we’re past that point. A reasonable reader’s takeaway: United will come up with some sort of story in coming days (and victim blaming is quite likely), but has no real intention of examining the culture that let this happen or overhauling the system that will practically ensure that it happens again. Munoz Statement Line 4: We are also reaching out to this passenger to talk directly to him and further address and resolve this situation.  At last this neutral mention of the passenger and the “situation” comes too late to convey any empathy or outrage. Instead it just sounds like an obligatory nod to the elephant in the room—the passenger with the bloody face who hasn’t been mentioned at all so far by the CEO, even though he is now a global star on Twitter. A reasonable reader’s takeaway: If they would have talked directly to the passenger, this never would have happened in the first place. Indeed, if this happened to that passenger, it could happen to me. Better to just avoid United. Beyond the general inadequacy of this statement as a tool for managing the crisis, it also reveals profound weaknesses in policy, values and culture at United. There was clearly no holding statement ready (or it wasn’t used) in anticipation of a crisis, despite the chaos and complaints that arise from overbooking hundreds of times every day at an airline. This begs the question: If they don’t have a contingency plan for utterly predictable customer service issues, do they have contingency plans for safety, security, or mechanical problems? One of the serious systemic issues this incident exposes and the scary questions it raises are about chaos, about lack of managerial engagement and sloppiness that United will have to now answer forever. But beyond systemic failure, the apparent belief in the C-Suite at United that this CEO Statement was either in line with the corporate values they say they demand—integrity, competence, respect—or compatible with a sustainable corporate culture that insists on transparency, collaboration, accountability and humanity—suggests there are moral bankruptcies that can precede financial ones. One thing is for sure: No one who read this statement came away with a sense that passengers are at the top of the United Airlines priority list. Or possibly even on that list at all."
POLITICS,"The 17-year-old who killed 10 people last week at his high school in Santa Fe, Texas, was too young to buy a gun, but he didn’t have to look far to find one. On Friday morning, he took his father’s pump-action shotgun and .38 revolver, concealed them under a trench coat and walked into an art class before opening fire on students, teachers and a responding school resource officer. Authorities haven’t released further details about how the gunman was able to access the weapons, but in the aftermath of the massacre, people from across the political spectrum have stressed the importance of securing firearms to keep minors and others from getting ahold of them without permission. “If you’re a parent and you own guns, lock your guns safely away,” Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a staunch pro-gun Republican, said at a press conference on Friday. “It’s a serious issue and one big step we can take.” Ed Scruggs, a board member of Texas Gun Sense, a nonprofit focused on gun violence prevention, offered similar advice. “If you have minors in the house, the guns should be secured, because anything just laying out is a risk,” Scruggs told HuffPost. Advocates on both sides of the gun debate appear to have found some elusive common ground in promoting safe and responsible firearm ownership, an issue that nationwide studies suggest is a worthy cause. A survey published earlier this year found that most gun owners don’t safely store all of their firearms in a locked container, such as a safe or gun case, or with a trigger lock device. Among households with children under 18, 55 percent of gun owners said they did. Some 4.6 million kids live in a home with a firearm that is unlocked and loaded, according to a recently published study. Those guns frequently end up in children’s hands, leading to suicides, fatal accidents and a number of recent school shooting events. Although Texans may agree on the need to confront the issue of unsecured guns, they don’t agree on the best way to do it. Texas is one of 27 states, as well as Washington, D.C., that attempts to compel gun owners to store their firearms properly with a child access prevention law, which allows prosecutors to charge adults with misdemeanor criminal negligence when a child under 17 obtains a “readily dischargeable” firearm from their property. Because the suspect in the Santa Fe shooting is 17, the law may not apply in this case. The Galveston County District Attorney’s office did not respond to a request for comment on whether it would pursue charges against the gunman’s father. Recent reports have called the effectiveness of the 1995 law into question. There were only 61 convictions statewide under the statute in its first 20 years, according to 2015 review by the Austin-American Statesman. Gun control experts say prosecutors may be hesitant to bring charges against individuals who may already be coping with a tragedy after a child’s shooting. They’ve also criticized the law because it doesn’t explicitly mandate safe storage practices and is typically only used after a tragedy has happened. To Scruggs, that’s proof the state should strengthen the law and clarify the circumstances in which it would be applied. “Right now, the state really does very little, if anything, to encourage the safe and secure storage of firearms at all,” Scruggs said. “It’s not really a gun rights issue, it’s just a gun issue and we shouldn’t be afraid to discuss it.” Last legislative session, Texas Gun Sense and other gun violence prevention groups also worked to launch a statewide education and public awareness campaign around gun safety, which would’ve used funds from the state’s handgun licensing fees. Gun rights groups opposed the measure, and it failed to make it out of committee. Alice Tripp, legislative director of the NRA-affiliated Texas State Rifle Association, said the push for a new gun safety program was a “noble goal,” but that the legislature shouldn’t be responsible for paying for it. “They can do what the rest of us do: Work your tail off, make money and give it to create it,” she told HuffPost. “You don’t do it through law and legislature and through tax funding.” Under federal law, every handgun sold by a licensed dealer must be accompanied with a trigger lock or other safety or storage device. Those rules don’t apply to private sales between individuals. Firearm manufacturers also include basic safety information in the owner’s manuals that come with their products. But Massachusetts is the only state that actually requires all firearms to be stored with a locking device in place when not in use. In an interview on Sunday, Patrick wouldn’t commit to supporting a stronger law on gun storage, insisting that Texas already “holds you responsible if you’re a gun owner.”  Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick on gun safety: “A gun ownership ... that comes with responsibility of gun control in your home” #CNNSOTU https://t.co/HcWwFsu65x Tripp said she opposes a more stringent safe storage law in Texas, and questioned whether police would even be able to enforce such a measure. She pointed to existing safety programs provided by groups like the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry’s lobbying association, and said that a large part of gun safety ultimately comes down to “parental logic.” “You don’t leave out poison or medications,” she said. “Nobody has to tell me not to store my car keys in my ignition, but there are people that do that.” But Tripp said she supported Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s plans to convene a roundtable discussion on gun violence and school safety following the Santa Fe shooting, an announcement that some saw as a surprise coming from a Republican who has long opposed any talk of gun control. She said she hoped to see them cover a number of proposals, including potential changes to the state’s child access prevention law. “If it needs to be a stronger penalty, then that needs to be discussed. But if it’s not being used at all, then how come?” she said. “Nothing can be off the table.” In the meantime, Scruggs said gun owners can take it upon themselves to begin an honest conversation around safe storage and keeping firearms out of the hands of their children. “Maybe people grew up in a house with hunting guns and other guns available, but they need to realize that we’re living in a different time,” he said. “We can never be too safe.”"
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― A 30-year-old former CIA employee who the federal government suspects of ― but has not charged with ― giving a massive trove of agency documents to WikiLeaks is also facing charges in Virginia, where he’s accused of snapping photos as he sexually assaulted a passed-out friend as she lay on the floor of his bathroom. Joshua Adam Schulte was arrested in August on federal child pornography charges, but it wasn’t until Tuesday that The Washington Post and The New York Times reported the government was interested in Schulte because it suspected him of providing WikiLeaks with thousands of documents on the CIA’s hacking operations. The “Vault 7 leak,” published in March 2017, was the largest loss of classified documents in CIA history. Schulte’s Manhattan apartment was searched one week after it was published. The government still hasn’t brought a case against Schulte in connection with WikiLeaks’ publication of the documents. Instead, they charged Schulte in August with child pornography over videos found on an encrypted computer server he started back in 2009 when he was in college. His lawyers have said that dozens of people had access to that server. The FBI also sent along photos they obtained from one of Schulte’s phones to prosecutors in Loudoun County, where he lived when he worked for the CIA. The photos, taken in April 2015, show a woman “passed out on the floor” of his bathroom and being sexually assaulted. The unnamed woman has been referred to as Schulte’s friend and former roommate. The government said in October that the county conducted its own investigation and interviewed the victim after the FBI provided the photographs. In November, according to federal prosecutors, Schulte was charged with two crimes: a felony count of object sexual penetration and a misdemeanor count of unlawful creation of an image of another. “The victim remembers the night in question. It was one of the few nights that she passed out and didn’t remember what occurred. She could also, apparently, identify the bathroom, which was the bathroom where she was staying as a roommate of Mr. Schulte’s,” a federal prosecutor said at a hearing in January. The government told the judge that the woman was unconscious at the time, and was unable to identify Schulte as assaulting her. But prosecutors in Virginia, the federal government told the court, were evidently able to confirm that the pair of hands depicted assaulting the woman belonged to Schulte. But even if it wasn’t Schulte who assaulted the victim, the federal prosecutor said it was “outrageous that Mr. Schulte would keep these types of images of someone who is supposed to be his friend on his phone” and contended it “shows more than just someone who wants to look at things; it shows someone who cannot control their impulses.” Schulte had been released on strict bail conditions in September but was detained in December after he was charged in Virginia as a result of the information the FBI had given to local prosecutors. Prosecutors also said he’d violated his release conditions by accessing his email as well as the anonymous internet network TOR. The new charge, they said, “shows that the defendant is someone who will act out on his impulses and actually engage in sexually dangerous behavior.” Neither Schulte’s attorney nor the Loudoun County prosecutor responded to HuffPost’s request for comment on those charges. The status of the Virginia case isn’t entirely clear. “Virginia never came to get him,” his lawyer said at the hearing in January. “Virginia just didn’t do anything in this case.” His lawyer said Virginia was “just sitting back and waiting to see what happens” with the case and that the state had “no interest in Mr. Schulte.” The only case against Schulte listed in Loudoun County court records available online is an old traffic offense. Schulte was recently assigned a federal public defender after his private attorney dropped out. The Times reported that Schulte’s family had spent most of their savings on legal fees. Meanwhile, Schulte remains in federal custody. Evidently a fan of Ayn Rand, he’s also begun writing lengthy, pseudonymous essays about the injustices of the federal criminal system for “John Galt’s Legal Defense Fund,” according to the Post and the Times. The Facebook page, a reference to the hero of Atlas Shrugged, had just two likes as of Tuesday.

ENTERTAINMENT,"Actress Julianna Margulies unleashed her funny method of venting at President Donald Trump on “The Tonight Show” Friday. The “Dietland” star told host Jimmy Fallon that she uses “Trump poop bags” to pick up after her dog. She said she received the bags, which have Trump’s face on them, as a gift from her in-laws. Now they’ve become a therapy of sorts when the family pooch does her business. Said Margulies: “There’s this sort of really cathartic, therapeutic moment, and I just stand there and I go, ‘You take a poopie! You take a poopie!’” Get the rest of the scoop above."
ENTERTAINMENT,"At one point in “I Feel Pretty,” after the newly emboldened protagonist, Renee Bennett (Amy Schumer), has landed her dream job as a receptionist at a haughty cosmetics company, she is in the cafeteria when the couture-clad CEO, Avery LeClair (Michelle Williams), spots her. Bosses at bustling beauty enterprises are, the average story goes, bloodthirsty. Avery, on other hand, is thirsty for an understanding of how normal people ― ones whose grandmothers aren’t the namesake of an imperious brand ― live their lives. Naturally, that’s something of a struggle for someone whose privilege butts up against her eccentricities. “I thought I smelled animal products,” she meows upon seeing Renee.  If an actor is fortunate, at some point she’ll give a performance so unlike anything we’ve ever seen her do that it’s downright startling. This week, Michelle Williams is that actor. Even though Williams’ first lead in a movie was playing an airheaded teenager who inadvertently exposes Richard Nixon’s Watergate break-in in the 1999 satire “Dick,” she’s since matured into a so-called serious actress with indie clout and four Oscar nominations to her name ― a fact that makes her bonkers work in “I Feel Pretty” all the more delicious. It’s the type of role that’s only memorable coming from an established performer, especially one known for dramatic heft like “Brokeback Mountain,” “Blue Valentine” and “Manchester by the Sea.”  Maybe your jaw will drop as low as mine did upon first hearing Williams speak in “I Feel Pretty,” which opens this weekend. Instead of the velvety innocence that usually accents her on-screen persona, Williams speaks with what co-directors Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein call “high-pitched vocal fry.” It’s an odd confluence of Valley Girl lilt, enunciated baby-speak and spacey stonerisms, further underscored because the character actually fits none of those attributes. Avery, we learn, has an MBA from Wharton and clerked for a Supreme Court justice before taking a leadership post at Lily LeClair.  Coupled with the bamboozled but relentlessly relaxed aura Williams brings to the film, Avery’s flat cadence skirts the dragon-lady stereotype that defines the high-powered fashionistas portrayed by Meryl Streep in “The Devil Wears Prada” and Tilda Swinton in “Trainwreck.” She carries herself with the weight of a feather, gliding along as if oblivious to her surroundings at all times. Kohn and SIlverstein, longtime creative partners who also penned “Never Been Kissed” and “He’s Just Not That Into You,” had written Avery’s intonation into their script, but they had no idea what Williams would do with it until a couple of weeks before she arrived on set. Williams sent Kohn and Silverstein an NPR story from 2015 about a woman incapable of feeling fear. The woman’s speech, which sounds almost identical to the voice Jenny Slate created for the adorable stop-motion creation Marcel the Shell, was Williams’ inspiration, though the results were still a work in progress when she tested it for Kohn and Silverstein over the phone. They didn’t hear the final version until they went to Williams’ trailer on her first day shooting the movie.  “Truthfully, the thing she did for us on the day in the trailer was not like anything we’d talked about before,” Silverstein said. “It was so much better.” “We were like, ‘Can you sustain it? How is it to do a voice like that?’” Kohn recalled. “She was like, ’Yes, I got it. I can do it. It’s part of the whole thing.’” Avery’s wardrobe completes the “whole thing.” Costume designer Debra McGuire, who was attracted to “I Feel Pretty” because its empowerment message works in opposition to the “tight, sexy” clothing she felt obligated to use while working on “Friends” in the ’90s, based Avery’s grandmother (Lauren Hutton) on a cosmetics guru she once knew who dressed head to toe in Chanel. With that in mind, McGuire wanted Avery to put a “fun” twist on high-end fashion, bringing a California ease to the office’s cutthroat New York setting. Furthermore, Avery and the self-effacing Renee needed to work as complements, not foils à la Streep and Anne Hathaway in “The Devil Wears Prada.” When Renee falls off a SoulCycle bike and knocks her head, her feelings of unworthiness vanish. Convinced she is suddenly thinner and more conventionally beautiful ― “Modeling is an option for me,” she later tells Avery and her colleague (Naomi Campbell) ― Renee encounters a series of contrivances that ultimately lead her to realize she got the job (and a boyfriend) without actually shapeshifting or altering her appearance.  Normally, McGuire would have designed Avery’s attire from scratch. But she didn’t have access to Williams during pre-production, as the actress was filming another movie in Europe (presumably “All the Money in the World,” which Williams shot in Rome immediately before “Pretty”). Instead, McGuire scouted Tom Ford, Dolce & Gabbana and Gucci boutiques. Knowing that Kohn and Silverstein didn’t want Williams to wear the same sort of regalia she dons in real life, McGuire sought an “au current” metropolitan sensibility accentuated by straight, flowing blond locks. “There was an Ivanka Trump vibe going on there,” she said half-jokingly.  That dichotomy ― corporate gloss meets puerile squeal ― is best evidenced in a baby-blue dress Avery wears with pink flowers and golden retrievers all over. A Dolce & Gabanna original that McGuire said was inspired by the designers’ own dogs, the blithe garment reflects Avery’s lifelong struggle to cultivate a personality despite the fact that no one takes her seriously. The movie’s producers first balked at the canine frock, thinking it might be too distracting, but McGuire, who had the directors’ support, wasn’t budging. “That dress was going to be on camera even if I had to stomp over anybody who didn’t want it,” she said. “I felt this was just a perfect place to show part of who this character is because there’s a snobby vibe to the Lily LeClair aesthetic. To come to work in a puppy dress, you’ve gotta be some kind of woman to do that.” Avery’s accouterments and wispiness mask a crippling insecurity. “I sound like a freaking moron,” she moans in an uncharacteristically candid moment, listing the line items on her astoundingly intellectual biography to prove how belittled she is because of her voice. In the same way that Schumer learns to value her body by the movie’s end, Avery is meant to better understand her place in the class-conscious, image-obsessed world. She is the face of Lily LeClair, but it’s her inability to muster the confidence needed to excel that encourages her to extend the brand to reach more than just snobby rich women. That arc is baked into Williams’ oddities.  “On the first day, she did this one thing where she, like, leaned on her hands together like she was posing for a picture while she was talking,” Silverstein said. “Avery has seen human behavior and tries to emulate it in ways that are not right: ‘Oh, this is what a person would do right now. They would lean on this table as they talk.’ [Williams] really got into that. This is the story of a person of privilege, yet someone who’s grown up with a lot of obstacles in her way and maybe without a lot of personal connections and without a lot of real human interaction. It’s just a really fun thing to watch her do this and find the line.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,"The Abakuá is an all-male, Afro-Cuban secret society that originated in Nigeria and gained traction in 19th-century Cuba, where African slaves would covertly participate in the mysterious rites and rituals as means of protection and forging community. Today, the mysterious Abakuá is the only prevalent secret society in Cuba. Through the centuries, one of the fundamental traditions of the brotherhood has remained constant: the secrets of the Abakuá must remain secret, at all costs.  The weight of this secrecy is palpable in the works of the late master printmaker Belkis Ayón, who made the Abakuá her primary subject matter. Throughout her career, the Afro-Cuban artist used the technique of collography to create sharp and unnerving representations of Abakuá folklore imbued with a feminist, intellectual edge. A retrospective of the artist’s works is on view now for the first time at a U.S. museum. As part of her unique process, Ayón collaged a variety of textured materials ― from soft paper to sandpaper to vegetable peelings ― onto a cardboard matrix, which she’d then cover with ink and run through a printing press. By layering a wide range of surfaces with different feels and absorbencies, Ayón could precisely control her ink ― whether it came out thick and velvety or delicate and scaly, yielding prints that resembled meticulously sketched drawings.  Ayón, who was born in Havana, Cuba, in 1967, became interested in the Abakuá and their mysterious traditions in 1985, when she was making art as a high school student. She was drawn, primarily, to the figure of Sikán, an African princess and the sole female character in Abakuá mythology.  According to legend, it was Sikán who originally discovered the magic of Abakuá, by accidentally trapping a fish who subsequently spoke to her in the mystical “voice” of Abakuá. Since women were banned from knowing the organization’s deepest secrets, Sikán was sworn to secrecy. The princess, however, gave in to temptation and divulged her forbidden knowledge to her fiancée; her life was sacrificed as a result.  In Abakuá lore, Sikán is killed for her transgressions. But in Ayón’s works, the figure is brought back to life, in part serving as a proxy for the artist herself. As Ayón put it: “I see myself as Sikán, in a certain way an observer, an intermediary and a revealer,” an exhibition statement from the Fowler Museum recounts her saying. “Sikán is a transgressor, and as such I see her, and I see myself.”   Like the princess, Ayón tests the limits of secrecy enshrouding the Abakuá, saturating her prints with graphic symbols and visual riddles ― sacred fish, roosters, goats, medallions, and snakes. The foreboding presence of silence bleeds through Ayón’s artistic style, in which humans appear as flattened figures in greyscale hues, endowed with large, expressive eyes and no mouths.  “These figures can look at you but cannot speak,” art historian Cristina Figueroa explained in an interview with NPR. “So you have to interpret what they’re trying to say through the expressions in their eyes.”  Furthermore, Ayón injects the all-male narrative of the Abakuá with feminine presence in her prints, accomplishing in art what could never manifest in real life. In “La cena (The Supper),” she riffs off the familiar image of The Last Supper, with Sikán replacing Jesus at the center of the table, and an assembly of lattice-laden shadow figures, also women, at her sides.  Together Sikán and Ayón challenged a realm of knowledge ordained solely for men, art serving as an alternative means of communication that rests on the power of the eyes, not the tongue.  Another, more sinister connection between Sikán and Ayón emerged on Sept. 11, 1999, when the artist shot herself with her father’s gun at just 32 years old. At the time of her death, Ayón was already a famed figure in the Cuban art world, having shown at the Venice Biennale in ‘93 and sold works to both MOCA and MoMA. For her loved ones, Ayón’s death was a complete and utter surprise, a mystery oddly akin to the shadowy scenarios that served as her subject matter.  Cuban police allegedly investigated the possibility that the Abakuá was behind Ayón’s death, perhaps for revealing some fraternal secret or disrespecting its boundaries, but later ruled that suspicion out. The artist’s death was deemed a suicide, a conclusion with which her family agrees. Still, a sense of uncertainty looms over the event; a riddle that will never be fully solved.  Following her death, Ayón’s family has worked tirelessly to preserve her oeuvre and share it with the world. Her sister gave up her career as a doctor to conserve the works, a challenge outside of a museum in Cuba’s humid atmosphere. It has long been a dream of Ayón’s family to see her work exhibited and celebrated around the world, making her first U.S. retrospective a truly momentous event.  “Nkame: A Retrospective of Cuban Printmaker Belkis Ayón” is organized by the Belkis Ayón Estate and Ayón Manso with the Fowler Museum in Los Angeles, guest-curated by Cristina Vives-Figueroa. The show, whose title translates to “greeting” and “praise” in the language of Abakuá, is divided into five parts, tracing the evolution of Ayón’s technique and career.  Recent strides in diplomatic relations between Cuba and the U.S. have enabled Ayón’s work to travel further than once seemed possible. “Here in Cuba, we always keep hope for everything,” the artist’s niece, Yadira Leyva Ayón, told The LA Times. “And we have hope that now, so many people will see Belkis’ work. It’s important for our culture and our family. She was a very outstanding artist and person. And this way, we keep her alive.”    “Nkame: A Retrospective of Cuban Printmaker Belkis Ayón” is on view at The Fowler Museum at UCLA until Feb. 12, 2017. "
POLITICS,"The Trump administration is poised to hand religious conservatives another victory: a slew of new federal rules that would give religious health care providers wide latitude to refuse to treat patients or perform procedures if doing so would violate their religious beliefs. Some of the most powerful hospital networks in the country have lobbied for these “conscience” rules, claiming they shouldn’t fear a legal risk for practicing medicine according to their religious beliefs. But those same hospital networks are already using religious justifications to place women in life-threatening situations with impunity, documents obtained by HuffPost show. At a hospital owned by Ascension, the largest Catholic hospital network in the country and a staunch proponent of a rule that would give nearly any health care worker the right to refuse care, doctors refused to intervene as a woman was undergoing a life-threatening miscarriage because they believed that doing so would be the same as performing an abortion, the documents show. Instead, they carted her out to the hospital parking lot so a relative could drive her to a different emergency room, where she underwent a massive blood transfusion and emergency surgery.  Ascension, which operates more than 150 hospitals according to these same religious principles, also runs a hospital where doctors refused to perform a tubal ligation, even though the patient was at risk of dying if she ever became pregnant again. And at hospitals controlled by Trinity Health, a network that manages nearly 100 care centers around the Midwest, multiple women have accused doctors of withholding emergency medicine because it violated their prohibitions on certain kinds of reproductive health care. One of the new rules, which the Trump administration proposed in January but has not finalized, would limit patients’ and advocates’ ability to protest these incidents. The rules would broaden and define the legal right of virtually any health care worker, from surgeons to nursing home attendants to receptionists, to refuse to provide or facilitate medical services that go against their personal religious beliefs or their employer’s. The reach of the new guidelines would be widespread. The American health care system relies heavily on Catholic and other religiously affiliated hospitals. Around 1 out of every 6 hospital beds in the U.S. is located in a Catholic facility, according to a 2016 report. That means for many Americans, the closest hospital is one that might refuse to treat them. That’s what happened on Oct. 25, 2012, when a woman arrived at St. John Hospital and Medical Center of Detroit in an ambulance. The woman was between 17 and 23 weeks pregnant — a point where an infant would not survive outside the womb — and in the midst of a miscarriage. Her condition was life-threatening and indicated that she needed an emergency termination to prevent the risk of bleeding to death, according to a complaint later filed by a medical staffer at another hospital. Doctors at St. John recognized they would not be able to prevent the death of the woman’s fetus. But they refused to offer her emergency intervention.  “I’m not sure why you’re here,” a doctor at St. John told the woman, according to the complaint. “We can’t help you since you’re having an abortion.” For a hospital, failing to try to stabilize a patient in a medical emergency is a violation of federal law. St. John broke this rule, then violated regulations again when it failed to transfer the woman to another hospital, federal investigators determined. When the woman left St. John, her heart rate was elevated and she was bleeding so much that staff were constantly cleaning blood off her body, according to documents from the investigation. But instead of calling an ambulance, St. John staff gave her directions to another hospital, placed her in a wheelchair and wheeled her into the parking lot. An unidentified woman then drove her away. “I think it was her mom or her aunt,” one staff member told an investigator. “I just saw her get into a car with a woman. Do you know if she got care at [the other hospital] and if she is OK?” In fact, once the woman arrived at Hutzel Women’s Hospital, she had a miscarriage and underwent emergency surgery to stop a “massive hemorrhage,” according to notes from the investigation. The woman had to be hospitalized for three days.  Several weeks later, a staff member at Hutzel filed a complaint about the woman’s treatment with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid for “multiple episodes of poor care.” “It seems inconceivable that a major hospital with labor and delivery services lacks the ability to care for a pregnant patient who is having a miscarriage or postpartum hemorrhage,” wrote the staff member, who is unidentified in the documents. “I believe that further investigation into these events is warranted to determine... why she received improper management of her life-threatening condition. She is interested in understanding also.” In an interview with a federal investigator, a St. John staff member said, “We are a Catholic institution and we do not perform abortions here if there are fetal heart tones.” All of Ascension’s hospitals adhere to a set of ethical guidelines written by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops that bans abortion services or “material cooperation” in an abortion. The guidelines do allow doctors to perform certain procedures as long as the primary goal is not to terminate the pregnancy but to save the life of the mother. But in practice, many Catholic hospitals place a blanket ban on any procedure they consider an abortion. Ascension is not the only Catholic health care system pressing the Trump administration to protect it from consequences for risking patients’ lives. Trinity Health, which has lobbied the Trump administration to dismantle an Affordable Care Act rule prohibiting gender discrimination, owns and operates several hospitals that have been accused of violating federal laws requiring hospitals to provide patients with basic care. One woman accused a Trinity hospital of refusing to remove her intrauterine device, which had been dislodged when she fell down, causing her weeks of pain. Mercy Health Partners in Michigan, which Trinity owns, risked the lives of five women who were having dangerous miscarriages by failing to offer a kind of medical intervention the hospital considered to be abortion, a whistleblower told federal authorities. All of the women suffered potentially fatal infections for which the typical treatment is to hasten the miscarriage. The whistleblower later reported three more cases where medical records suggested the hospital withheld certain treatment options because of its Catholic affiliation, according to federal records obtained by HuffPost.  A spokesperson for Mercy Health Partners declined to comment. Ascension did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Religiously affiliated hospitals already rarely face consequences for refusing to provide treatments. Under former President Barack Obama, the Department of Health and Human Services made a brief and perfunctory threat to suspend St. John’s right to participate in Medicare, but dropped it once St. John took “corrective action.” Trinity Health did not receive any major citations for breaking any laws after federal investigators received the complaints about Mercy. And courts have dismissed a string of lawsuits against Catholic hospitals for refusing reproductive health care.  With the new rules in place, they could enjoy even more protection."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Tina Fey has something of an confession about how the recent batch of “30 Rock” reboot rumors may have started. On Thursday’s broadcast of “The Tonight Show,” the actress acknowledged to host Jimmy Fallon that the latest round of speculation may have begun with a coy response she gave on the red carpet for her new “Mean Girls” musical. “Well … OK. Here’s what I’ll say. So we were on the red carpet for the Broadway opening and someone was like, ‘Would you ever do a “30 Rock” reboot?’ And I was like ‘Maybe …,’” Fey said.  “A little bit of that is on me, like I must be so thirsty for internet attention,” Fey explained. “Maybe I’m Banksy,” she jokingly added, before revealing how she’d never do a straight reboot of the show that ended in 2013, “because that would be too easy.” “If we get anything together, I promise you will be the first to know,” she added. Later in the show, Fey spread the love by surprising unexpecting fans who lined up in front of a promo poster for her musical to explain how she’d inspired them:"
ARTS & CULTURE,"In September, I experienced a landmark in my life as an artist: the opening of a room in a museum in which a painting of mine is permanently installed. The painting is Day, my first painting of Leah, a muse and friend I have worked with almost every week since 2009. The museum is the New Britain Museum of American Art. And the room is what I'd like to talk about with you today -- it was the room for the Post-Contemporary Art collection. Post-Contemporary Art sounds very official, doesn't it? I'm not sure who came up with the term, but I know that painter Graydon Parrish pushed for its use to describe something which, in its current state, is very loose and amorphous. You could call it an art movement, except that the only things about it which everyone interested in participating seems to agree on are that the art called Post-Contemporary should show three qualities: 1. Skill
2. Creativity
3. Empathy Absent any stricter definition, I guess I'll tell you what I think it is, and why it's important. For a sense of it, we start with the famous third chapter of Ecclesiastes, verses 1-3: 1. To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
2. A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
3. A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; This is the start of a poignant tapestry of opposites, developing the idea of cyclic time. It describes the world, and life, but it applies to art as well. I think we can all agree that for Western art, since the hour of that famous urinal, this has been a verse 3b1 kind of time: a season of breaking down. There have been fancy names for the principles involved - modernism and postmodernism, deconstructionism, critical theory - but what it comes to in the end is breaking down, breaking down the past, breaking down tradition, breaking down assumptions and mores.  It has been a long season of breaking down, and I think we are about at the end of it. Post-Contemporary is a name for the dawning season, for springtime, a time to build up. We have been through an age of doubt. But to build, one must give up doubt in certain very important ways: one must trust in one's foundations. The three qualities above - skill, creativity, empathy - are the Post-Contemporary proposal for foundations to be trusted. You can build walls and floors upon them without fear that they will crumble. TOWARD THE BURDEN LIMIT Before we discuss springtime, let's review winter. Set before the eye of your imagining the heirs, for instance, to a vast steel fortune. The generations before have exerted themselves in endless labors, accumulating great wealth through thrift and industry. Over time, however, the descendants have gradually forgotten the homely virtues that earned their family's fame. At last we come to the end of the line, a generation of profligate hedonists determined to burn through their inheritance in a sustained, astonishing performance of libertinism. This last generation is possessed by dark virtues -- some might even call them vices -- but they are not without a kind of infernal creativity. They carry out their willful destruction of the family business with one dazzling spectacle of decadence after another. There is a terrible beauty to their creations, not only in their specific forms, but in their medium; for their medium is the scandalous waste of resources painfully husbanded by an unbroken line of disciplined, self-denying ancestors. There is a stomach-churning giddiness to be had in beholding their raucous frivolities. There is a genius to their bloody-minded work. This is not a simile for today's avant garde art. It is a simile for the avant garde art of a century ago. Dada is already 102 years old. The readymade is closer to the battle of Antietam than it is to us. Who is the other half of the simile, the old industrious family? This: up until the dawn of ""anti-art,"" Western art had undergone about 650 years of more or less continuous upward struggle. The goals of this struggle were never entirely agreed upon, and yet many steps in the struggle built upon older ones. Even the failures were treated with respect. It was understood they had been pursued in a spirit of hope and hard work. The early 20th century saw an end to that fellow feeling, even before the all-is-forgiven trauma of the First World War. Aspiration was replaced with spite; skill with impulse; empathy with scorn; veneration with derision; and above all, hope with mania, and ultimately with despair.  What came of this violent attitude? Great art. It birthed magnificent art such as the world had never seen. Revolution on revolution, chain earthquakes, upheavals and revelations. But that first generation was a generation of geniuses, and the fortune they set out to burn was the treasure-house of the West itself. It could hardly have gone otherwise. I once read a fascinating analysis of sadism. This analysis claimed that without being animated by a living Catholic faith, sadism is impossible. Sadism depends on desecration, and without the holy, there is no desecration. Similarly, those early, radical works of the now-distant avant garde depended on the continued vitality of the Western tradition. Without it, how could Tristan Tzara have kept a straight face as he wrote: Let each man proclaim: there is a great negative work of destruction to be accomplished. We must sweep and clean. Affirm the cleanliness of the individual after the state of madness, aggressive complete madness of a world abandoned to the hands of bandits, who rend one another and destroy the centuries. Without aim or design, without organization: indomitable madness, decomposition. (Dada Manifesto, 1918)1 He could not. And yet he won; the great negative work of destruction was accomplished. In the end, it was all bandits, and no centuries left to destroy. Witness the past sixty years of artists scrambling after any crumb of respectable tradition left to shit on -- ""to shit in different colors"" (Tzara) -- a desperate scramble against the entropic end-state of decadence, which is boredom: one really great orgasm, a second, not as good, and then an eternal refractory period. The family fortune has been consumed, the seed grain was used to bake yesteryear's bread.  The permanent revolution inevitably spawns the Institutional Revolutionary Party. So too did this take place in art. The institutionalization of the avant garde ruled out any art but the so-called revolutionary: smashing the past while creating a new language. Read any really glowing highbrow review from the past couple generations, and odds are good the artist will be claimed to have created a new way of seeing, a new language, a new medium, or a new art form. Who is capable of so heroic an effort? Only a genius. The revolutionary logic of the institutional avant garde makes it a cult of geniuses. And yet, when everything is new, the scope of ingenuity must ever broaden in order to continue the revolution. I'd argue the last genius, in his eating-an-earthworm way, was Chris Burden. Both revolutionary logic and common sense, however, dictate that you can only shoot yourself in the arm for art once before it's tired. This kind of destructive act of genius is the artistic equivalent of clearing a kiloton of rainforest for a single hamburger. It might be a very tasty hamburger, but it's the opposite of sustainable. After the scathing nihilism of the gunshot to the arm, there are only a few more moves available. Burden lacked the insight or the nerve to make those moves. After Shoot, the stunt with the car descends into the realm of twee socio-economic critique.  The moves, of course, are all those remaining which extend Tzara's demand for ""the great negative work of destruction."" After Burden flirted with self-destruction, the list was whittled down to these: suicide, destruction of art, rape, murder and mass-murder. To my knowledge we have not yet witnessed the art-suicide, nor the art-rape, the art-murder, or the art mass-murder. But we have witnessed the attempted appropriation of the non-art mass-murder for art. Recall composer Karlheinz Stockhausen's press conference of September 16, 2001, in which he discussed certain events of five days earlier: ""Well, what happened there is, of course -- now all of you must adjust your brains--the biggest work of art there has ever been. The fact that spirits achieve with one act something which we in music could never dream of, that people practice ten years madly, fanatically for a concert. And then die. And that is the greatest work of art that exists for the whole Cosmos. Just imagine what happened there. There are people who are so concentrated on this single performance, and then five thousand people are driven to Resurrection. In one moment. I couldn't do that. Compared to that, we are nothing, as composers.""2 And yet, we have seen plenty of destruction of art for art. Let me pass over the bombing of the Bamiyan Buddhas, and the bulldozing of Palmyra, because those were at least proper iconoclasms. Similarly the enterprising art criticism involved in butchering Theo Van Gogh or gunning down the senior staff of Charlie Hebdo. I also pass over Ai Weiwei's interference with those Han dynasty vases. I am a little more interested in Walter Gropius convening his students at Harvard in the 1950's to smash up the plaster casts of classical sculptures.3 But what I really want to bring to your attention is the personal account of painter F. Scott Hess4: ""In 1974, as a freshman at Lawrence University in Appleton, WI, I sat through many an art history lecture in a darkened auditorium where they also displayed the university art collection. Included was a large Bouguereau of two little sisters. As he was consistently denigrated in lectures as the 'boogie man' of modern art (everything painting shouldn't be, pure kitsch) the painting was abused. I remember it having about a dozen puncture wounds from students' pencils."" This, my friends, is the end state of this particular chain of logic. Not the bracing bonfires of books and paintings, but the petty, normalized follow-ons, the Milgram's 37 of art: undergrads with No. 2 pencils, mimicking authority. At the cannibalistic dead end of the road Tzara planned, we finally come near to answering the question, ""What isn't art?"" If incineration is your paintbrush, then human beings cannot be your medium. If penetration by sharp objects is your paintbrush, then existing paintings cannot be your medium. Art itself does not preclude such art. Art has no formal limits. Only our morality as civilized human beings does. After Tzara, Duchamp, and Burden, the deconstructionist revolution yields only phenomena that are not art. If they do not exceed the Burden Limit, they are not revolutionary. And if they deconstruct beyond this limit, they are not art. The ""time to break down"" left the realm of art -- morally, if not formally -- with a gunshot to the arm in 1971. The 44 years since then have been nothing but trivia and monstrosities.  BURIED TREASURE Now let us leave behind the musty abattoir, and breathe the fresh air of the Post-Contemporary. Through the long darkness of the modern era, a thread ran. It is like a chain buried underneath a barren shore. Some pilgrim, reaching the sea at last, finds a single rusty link upon the ground. He stoops to pick it up. But a tug on the first link reveals a second; the second, a third; and the third, a fourth. The pilgrim makes his way along the strand, unearthing the hundreds of links of an enormous chain. At the end of the chain, a vast form lies buried. It is a shipwreck, and the chain once held its anchor. In the hold of the ship are skeletons, and treasure. They went through a period of desiccation and decay, but they have been quietly reassembling themselves. The tarnish has fallen off the coins, and flesh has knit itself over dry bones. All this lay hidden underneath the featureless waste, indicated by a single rusty link. Tristan Tzara and his heirs proclaimed the annihilation, and then the utopia. They overlooked the same thing all utopians overlook: that human nature is not entirely malleable. Some things about it may be prodded and molded by the temper of the age, but it will always have in it a chamber for love, and another for hate. It will always harbor hope and fear, longing and regret, anticipation and nostalgia. It must retain its aspiration toward the good, and its temptation toward evil. There is a place in it for the utopian's thrill in destruction and creation, but the experience of this thrill does not transform human nature. There is always a day after the epiphany. There is no New Man. There is only us. Walking alongside this immutable humanity is art. Art is nothing more than the vessel of a human search for meaning. Just as human nature does not change, so art does not change -- not really. Its methods may change. Some may increase in power, and others fall into disuse. But the needs it answers to remain the same. The pathos of a dying lion carved on a Mesopotamian wall has surely changed since Ashurbanipal commissioned it, but the force of the image has not. The sterile Contemporary age ultimately gave us a light bulb flickering on and off in an empty room, an aesthetic equivalent to that abandoned shore. But the age, and the room, and the shore, were illusions. As Freud points out, the repressed returns. Underneath modernity, the chain lay buried, waiting to lead us back to the ship. The ship was human art, and its hull and crew have nearly healed themselves, in their century underground. Human art depicts, because the eye thirsts to see. It depicts human beings, because we are social animals, and understand ourselves in the faces and bodies of our fellows. It depicts stories, because human beings tell stories to make sense of their world. It depicts landscapes, because we come from the land, and live on the land, and die on the land and return to it. It depicts still lives, because we sanctify our objects and find the soulfulness in them. It depicts animals, because animals have been our companions since the beginning, and we raised them, and they raised us. It depicts visions and fancies, because we have always sought to make our imaginings more convincing, and that meant cloaking them in the forms of the real. Genius forms the skeleton of human art, but love is its flesh. The Post-Contemporary age throws off the shackles of a small cabal of embittered rejectionists, who stridently sought to delegitimize human nature and its works, to replace the hunger for eternity with an addiction to novelty, to replace the search for meaning with the cleverness of critique, to replace the beauty of the truth with the glamor of destruction. Art does not belong to cliques, or insiders, or aesthetes. It belongs to everyone who yearns for it, which is to say, some form of it belongs to everyone. FOUNDATIONS Returning to the Post-Contemporary proposal for foundations to be trusted: 1. Skill. Art is meaningful. All things have some meaning, but there is a special aspect to the meaningfulness of art. When we say that art is meaningful, what we mean is that a conscious human being made the thing, and made it in on purpose. The art may result from intention, in which the mind makes a choice and the hand follows. Or it may result from inspiration, in which the soul receives an insight, and the artist becomes its slave. Whether intention or inspiration triggers the artwork, the artist cannot serve the artwork without proceeding from a foundation of skill. Skill ramps up and down to match the demands of the vision. A lack of skill hampers the expression of that vision. The guarantee of skill in general indicates that when a particular skill is not used, it is not used because the nature of the work, and not the limit of the worker, demands that it be set aside. The mature, self-described artist who makes a mark without skill is already partway devolved back to the meaningfulness of nature. That artist may make a magnificent work, but without skill it has no human on-purposeness, and without this, it lacks human meaning. Its magnificence is of a kind with the cloud, the lightning, the sand dune, and the sea. But it is less than these, so why should anyone look at it? ""But,"" argues one partisan of deskilling, ""the genius invents new forms of art; what need has he or she of skills?"" To which I answer: true. But only somebody who has never created anything could sustain the naive and romantic notion that there is a real genius, who wakes up one morning with a vision of the new world - and then manages to implement or communicate it at all without a tremendous basis in the same pedestrian skills that have served lesser goals a thousand years and more. It has never happened, and will never happen. The unskilled genius may have the vision, but he or she is condemned to failing it, without first acquiring the eloquence of skill. ""But,"" argues another partisan of deskilling, ""skill diminishes the pure impulse. It's easy. It substitutes an automatized set of rules for the genuine flash of originality."" Not so; not at all. Two responses to this argument. The first response is that skill, in the hands of an artist, does not automatize art-making. Rather, it makes it more difficult. It offers a thousand tools, and no guide what to do with them. It strips the artist naked before the demands of the art, without the contributions of incapacity to muddy the waters. Bad skilled art is much, much easier to recognize than bad unskilled art.  The second response is that clearly skill carries with it a temptation to deadening, to the rote. One must, in the face of this temptation, persevere in fiery consciousness. Conclusion: art is hard. What did everybody expect? In a few ways, art is harder than anything. Maintaining the original flash in the face of the acquisition of skill is one of those things about art that is nothing but hard. A serious artist masters skill, and is not mastered by it. He or she understands that skills are tools. There is much joy in them, but they serve a goal. They are not themselves the goal. The serious artist pursues a very difficult program: on the one hand, spending years to acquire skills, and on the other hand, throughout that entire time, grasping, as to the tree of life, his or her original and unique reasons for wanting to make art. This leads to the second foundation of Post-Contemporary art. 2. Creativity This fiery consciousness, this original reason, this tree of life, is of course what we call creativity. It arises differently in different people. In some it is a blaze which lights from an early age; over time it may sustain itself in a torrent, or it may calm to a workable glow. In others it emerges alongside skill, with skill feeding it, and it feeding skill. In still others it appears as a sudden and startling realization later in life. There is no end to possible forms of creativity. The Post-Contemporary concept does not function without the application of creativity to the question of making art. Creativity drives the impulse to make art. It is the ichor that flows down the channels provided by skill.  It is also one of those very fundamental concepts which is difficult to define in a rigorous way. I have my own intuition about it, but I wanted a different perspective, so I wrote to Graydon Parrish to ask what he had to say. Most of us are friends with one another. More on this later. Graydon says this: ""Contemporary art emphasizes being original as the sine qua non of art and has pursued it at all costs. This program has been a failure. All we see is painful conformity. Being original is a difficult if not impossible goal from the start. And it isn't really sustainable. However, creativity is. To ask artists to be creative, rather than original (or novel) is a good thing. Creativity implies life, joy and exploration without the burden of coming up with something that no one has ever made before.   ""Creativity is also linked to skill. Daniel C. Dennett in his book Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking affirms what many of us know already: one cannot be creative without knowledge and tradition. That is, I am actually more creative as a trained and skillful musician, artist or writer than I would be at large without skills and parameters. The brain just needs fuel in order to create and in the world of art, this is learning how to draw, to paint or sculpt, art history and perhaps, now, science.    ""Creativity is risky. To try something new means failure most of the time. Of course, having a set of skills helps, but one still has to strive to think differently, and this is difficult. It is the struggle here that breads an empathetic response to others who have tried and failed.  In order to have empathy, one must have done something hard, gotten in the ring, so to speak, rather than sat on the sidelines.  (Your offer to Saltz was a way for him to gain empathy for the artists he derides.)  ""As I see it, there is a deep connection between the three 'pillars' of PoCo: skill, creativity and empathy. Learning a craft unlocks creativity, and being creative connects you to others. This connection helps you make art not only for yourself, but for an audience you care about."" Thus Graydon. His mention of Saltz (Jerry) is a reference to an article on drawing in which I invited Jerry to come life drawing with me,5 an offer he turned down.6 Graydon's mention of this episode makes me think I ought to name at least one living name myself. How are you going to get your movement going without burning a bridge or two? So let me nominate Matthew Barney as a shining instance of Graydon's idea of a tension between originality and creativity. I restrict myself here to the Cremaster films. I am unfamiliar with the rest of Barney's work, which may well contradict much of what I have to say.  There is little disputing that the Cremaster cycle is an original work. Nobody else has made anything quite like it -- a sprawling cinematic epic, shot radically out of sequence, with wildly varying degrees of production value and an inconstant narrative format, from the classical to the surreal to the dadaist, expressed overall in a clinical tone evocative, at times explicitly, of profound sexual anxiety. It is shown as an art object, not a film, so it is difficult to get a chance to see it. When I had my chance, some years ago, I leapt to go.  And I found it utterly mystifying. Why? Because it brims with images, and yet bears the icily fastidious mark of a person who is not creative. The images are messy and gregarious, but their maker is stiff and dry. I have never seen these things go together: the psychology of the art, as manifested in the content, and its maker, as manifested in the style, at irreconcilable odds. There it lay for years, Matthew Barney a question mark in my mind, my opinion suspended pending more information. Then one day, I got it. An ancient legal dispute over distribution rights was resolved, and Alejandro Jodorowsky's 1973 movie Holy Mountain came out of film history limbo and returned to theaters, where it belonged. I went to see this too. I happened to be with my friend Bob. Watching the movie, I experienced a strange double-emotion: on the one hand, elation at discovering a masterpiece. And on the other hand, dismayed insult. Virtually every key image in Cremaster, including the logo,7 proved to be a copy of an original in Holy Mountain. Except, unlike Cremaster, Holy Mountain is a unified work. Unlike Cremaster, it has a coherent narrative served by each of the same set of images. It conceptualizes itself, as Graydon discusses, as an innovation within the traditions it inhabits - chief among them the hermetic tradition. Unlike Cremaster, it boils with vitality. Holy Mountain is joyful and experimental and urgently affectionate, the work of a laughing madman who runs up to you to give you a hug. As the credits rolled, I turned frowning to Bob, and Bob turned frowning to me. He said, ""Cremaster?""  Matthew Barney is original, but he is not creative. The Cremaster cycle is a fake, a lockstep ripoff of an unacknowledged and far superior original. To be fair, there was no reason at the time to expect that anyone except a very few film fanatics would ever see Holy Mountain again. Ironically, that sad fate now awaits Cremaster, which insists it is a delicacy for the few, and not an iTunes download for the many. The uncreative property of contemporary art has led to a flowering of so-called ""appropriation"" art, in which the charm of the new work derives from the charm of some original work or object which the artist has appropriated and recontextualized. ""Recontextualization"" is academic jargon for the shabby practice of messing with an original in a carefully calibrated dance which stops just short of annihilating the charm of the original; for any new elements are charmless, because the artist who made them is not creative. Richard Prince and Jeff Koons are the chief swindlers currently linked to this particular practice, with Prince having descended in his dotage to image-theft from random strangers over Instagram. This project is said to be frightfully clever by the fawning herd of critics and academics, and simple fraud by anyone with taste or decency.  Apart from the miserable practice of appropriation and recontextualization, the lack of creativity of the contemporary scene reveals itself in the dismal panorama of the gallery/artfair/auction/museum complex: packed with endless, joyless variations on the same narrow set of barren configurations and practices. Nobody likes these dead things, not even the buyers (we will discuss the role of the buyers in a future article). The Post-Contemporary program asserts that creativity is needed, that the universe's storehouse of great and resonant images is not yet exhausted, that the species that gave us the unsettling dimness of Velazquez's Las Meninas, the demanding and redeeming light of Caravaggio's Calling of St. Matthew, the fearfully patterned flames of Botticelli's Inferno, or even the blinding spike of broken glass that arcs across Hunt's Lady of Shalott - that that species is not finished creating great things and, in fact, that nothing less than great things is what we ought to demand of ourselves. 3. Empathy And finally, there is empathy, the famous Einfühlung: the in-feeling, the in-suffering, the overall sense that what you have felt and suffered, I have as well, and what I have felt and suffered, you have undergone. Empathy as a concept is closely linked to art appreciation; it is the connection made through art which binds us to one another, and punctures the sour borders of our loneliness, allowing us to commune with one another. To my way of thinking, this is the weakest tenet of Post-Contemporary art. Consider how much energy the Contemporary apparatus has spent attacking the ethos of skill and the concept of creativity. But what partisan of the Contemporary has bothered himself about empathy? It is a less obvious and direct trait of art, it does not so much address what art is made of, but what it is made for. Empathy as a characteristic of art depends, in some sense, on applying concepts outside the proper scope of art itself. Setting the Burden Limit invokes similarly extrinsic concerns. Because empathy is the weakest tenet, it is the most poignant. It cannot defend itself. It makes demands upon our humanity, it begs of us that we show humanity, and it leads us on the way toward vulnerability by itself being radically vulnerable - it is unjustifiable. In Graydon's passage above, he discusses one axis of empathy - that between critic and art. He suggests that the critic should open himself to his own vulnerability, in order to empathize with the vulnerability of the artist and the art. This, to me, is a problematic argument, because it suggests criticism on the basis of some factor apart from the quality of the work. And yet, I cannot reject Graydon's argument for this reason: the criticism of the modern age has a sorry record as regards evaluating the quality of work. It has done quite badly all on its own, without any empathy at all. At least with empathy it might not have been indecent. And it is entirely possible that empathy leads to good taste. But the important axes of empathy are these: between artist and art, and between artist and viewer. The artist must make himself or herself vulnerable to the work, in order to allow the work to begin to breathe with life. And the artist must empathize with the viewer, in order to learn to speak with the viewer, and to share common experiences and new ones.  Consider for a moment the father and son in Rembrandt's The Prodigal Son. Having returned to his father, the son kneels, clothes tattered, one foot bare where his shoe has fallen apart. He slumps against his father, head shaven and bowed, eyes closed. The father hunches over the son, bowed as well, worn with age and concern, blinded by his emotion. He has returned to the realm of touch: he rests his hands on his son's shoulders, in an all-encompassing gesture of relief, of forgiveness and ingathering. It is impossible to look at this painting without being struck blind, like the father, and awakened to the inner truths it conveys: that we are all going home, that we all need to be forgiven and don't deserve it - and that we are all waiting for those who have left, and that we have already forgiven them for their part in whatever it was that drove us apart. This painting teaches a lesson in empathy which has never been exceeded. Rembrandt is tender with his art, and compassionate with his viewer. He recognizes the things he and his viewer have both suffered, and understands that the entirety of his wisdom is to have seen a few steps farther along the path of the spirit, and refined an ability to summarize and communicate what he knows in images of heartbreaking clarity. He respects his situation, and does his best. Nobody can do more. His achievement calls out to us. We are free to shirk the challenge of finding, in our own way and for our own time, so mighty a testament to empathy and humanity. But the odds are very, very poor we will find some better thing to do. Geniuses have been trying, and failing, for over a century. -- These three then: skill - creativity - empathy. These are the bare minima. Post-Contemporary is not a philosophy, a style, or, ultimately, much of a movement. It is a course correction. Certain essential things about art have been forgotten or willfully obscured. Art has suffered for it, and our culture has suffered for it. People depend on art, and art has scorned their needs and pushed them away. The Post-Contemporary course correction says, ""Enough.""  AGAINST WHOM? The odds are very high that if you are among the first round of people to have gotten this far in this particular article, we actually know one another. Because I like to look at all kinds of art, and have become friends with the artists who make it, no doubt some of you are looking at my denigration of contemporary art and asking yourselves, ""Is he talking about me?"" The answer is almost entirely ""no."" I don't hang out with the kind of empty-souled con men and heartless scenesters who make the art I've been criticizing. I know they exist, but I know very few of them personally. Virtually all of you, working as you are in your diverse fields of expression and abstraction and what-have-you, have, in your own ways, forged a sincere path - you may not be Post-Contemporary, but you are not cynical. More importantly, however, each of you has failed to further the Tzarist program. As I said before, it is a program in need of a terminally small number of pieces of art, to carry it from inception to the Burden Limit. Every one of those pieces has been made, and you did not make them. From the perspective of pure modernity and postmodernity, your work is superfluous. Even those of you following one Tzarist art-making model or another are repeating a chess move executed long ago. This means that your interest is more aesthetic than political - and so you are already a reactionary. You have let down Tzara. Against whom, precisely, have I been inveighing? It's a good question, and I have reflected on it for a long time. We are all stuck down here in the trenches, where we pick sides, or sides will be picked for us. I would like all of the artists to sit together at one table, and exchange ideas and inspirations in an atmosphere of friendship. But I recognize that not everyone would like to extend me and my work the same respect. Consider the following comment, tweeted to an art critic friend who is broadly of like mind with me: >Afraid the idea of ""expression"" has been almost entirely deconstructed and debunked, as cliche, among art historians A respected and widely-published critic (no, not Jerry) wrote this dismissive little rabbit shit of a thought. It would appear that a cadre of academics somewhere has deduced to their satisfaction what I am, and am not, allowed to do. These academics are like Susanna Clarke's scholarly magicians of York: ""...not one of these magicians had ever cast the smallest spell, nor by magic caused one leaf to tremble upon a tree, made one mote of dust to alter its course or changed a single hair upon any one's head."" (Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, p. 1) She continues, describing the current state of the academy quite well: ""But, with this one minor reservation, they enjoyed a reputation as some of the wisest and most magical gentlemen in Yorkshire."" It is hollow theorists such as these who have broken down everything in art except the walls between artists and other artists, and between artists and art, and between art and the public. These walls they have built high, with ideas bearing the weight and texture of bricks, and they have set themselves up as traffic cops and toll collectors in their suffocating labyrinth. You would call them petty tyrants, if the territory they had filched were petty. But it isn't. It's some of the most important real estate there is. So they're just tyrants. These sonsofbitches must go. They are, however, only one node of an interlocked network of persons interested in maintaining a stultifyingly narrow status quo. The professors operate hand-in-palm with curators, critics, museum directors, dealers, and buyers. As I said, we will discuss the buyer ecosystem in greater detail soon, and this will touch on the rest of the sorry legion. An anecdote: I know an individual who is very highly placed in the network I am describing here. He is involved in maneuvering large resources at a high level in the art world. He is a perceptive, intelligent, and thoughtful guy, and like me, he is interested in discussion. He follows my writing, and describes himself as respecting my work, despite it not being his thing; I believe him. I once asked him how I could tailor my presentation to make my work acceptable to people in his sector. He said there was nothing I could do, because the work was categorically irrelevant. It had nothing to do with presentation. Seeking to soften this assessment, he noted that there are collectors, galleries, and publications operating in my sector, and that surely I can find a full life in it, among those with outlooks similar to mine. I pondered his response for a long time. There is much of value in it. It is true that I have a sector, and that this is a flourishing sector with its own customs, events, stars, and so forth. But for all that, it is a ghetto. My acquaintance is interfaced with the dominant museums, auction houses, collectors, and media outlets. I suppose I have developed an amount of access to them myself which would be enviable to most artists. But I have to fight a categorical exclusion every inch of the way. I want unbiased access. I resent walking a gauntlet of contempt and disparagement. I do not want this access because I want fame or money, although I do want them - but the ""I"" here is corporate: I would be content if my own work failed the quality test for access but my kind of work got in. I want it in not because I want fame and money, but because I want history and culture. The dominant art network is busy writing art history, and I will not accept categorical exclusion from it. Nor will I abandon culture. The broad mass of people needs art, and art needs them. Filing in to Van Gogh spectaculars and glitzy fashion retrospectives does not count. The public deserves a vibrant world of new art that neither scorns nor entertains it, but rather delivers those necessary things art particularly can: transcendence, uplift, enlightenment. Why doesn't my acquaintance, who is so thoughtful and open to discussion, help with this program? At the most pragmatic level, why isn't he interested in getting in at the curatorial and investment ground floor of my scene, before his colleagues? I have reflected on this as well. And my conclusion is: it's not his job. His job is not to create culture, but to facilitate its flow. That means it's my job. It's my job to change the terrain underneath his feet. Once the watershed changes, he will change, and if not him, then his colleagues. And that's fine. That's what I'm here doing. I've treated this as my job for some years now, and I think it is producing results. The New Britain Museum of American Art's accession and installation of a Post-Contemporary collection would tend to argue that I am not entirely incorrect about how things are going; nor, increasingly, is the NBMAA alone in this type of decision. The question, though, was ""against whom?"" Let's try to define it from another angle. Here's an experience I have been having for a long time, which will be familiar to several of you. Some art world person asks what you do. You tell them that you are an artist. They ask what kind of work you do. You describe your figurative work to them, or show it to them. Then they give you a jaundiced squint, and you find that you must defend your work - not against the charge that it is bad, but against the charge that it is wrong. You must defend the premise of your work, the legitimacy of highly-rendered sincere figurative or representational painting itself. This must end. To each of you jaundiced squinters, then, here is notice. I am against you. Your dominion has played itself out. Your assumption of entitlement is undone, and your entitlement depends entirely on that assumption. Therefore you are finished. Inertia may carry you along a little longer, but you will have no peace. You will have no peace from the ghosts of the dead, and you will have no peace from the ghosts of the living.  I am against those who squint. The legitimacy of my work is not in question. From a great distance, over tremendous spans of effort and time, I and my friends have carried and developed a culture which was left for dead. It is not dead. It is a great and living culture, and it is coming home. FOR WHOM? I and the program I am describing are for three somewhat overlapping groups of people: Post-Contemporary artists, artists who are not Post-Contemporary, and everyone. Let me explain what I think the Post-Contemporary concept offers each of these groups. For Post-Contemporary Artists An anecdote: a different guy I know, also highly placed in the dominant art sector. One time he made a social media post about a particularly impressive artwork which had passed through his establishment. I commented how enviable it was that he got to interact so closely with such great art. He joked, ""I didn't get into the art world for the personalities."" Now that's very telling. He might have friends in the art world, or not, but the joke was there at the front of his mind to make. It suggests that among his colleagues, he finds himself feeling revulsion, or loneliness.  Let's move to a different community for a moment. I have spent a certain amount of time among skydivers. There is an interesting thing about the core skydiving community which, once you notice it, you feel you should have anticipated. Skydiving is addictive to a certain small wedge of humanity. But who is most likely to follow up on this addiction and build a life around the drop zone? Two demographics: hippies and ex-military. As one would imagine, the hippies tend to be on the left side of the political spectrum, and the special forces types on the right. But they all have to share the drop zone. So they have learned to respect one another's differences of opinion and live together anyway. This is a model of fraternity which much of the country used to follow. A glance at Facebook or Twitter will reveal that mediated communication has encouraged many to slip away from this practice of tolerance. Tolerance is not about celebrating a diversity that you love. It is about accepting differences that you despise. It is not an unlimited virtue, but it is much broader than is commonly practiced today. Tolerance allows one to find friendship and love not because of differences, but despite them. The skydivers have created a community rooted in shared passion and political tolerance, and their friendships are rare and profound. Tolerance does not pertain to political difference alone. Eighteenth and nineteenth century England is understood to have been the golden age of eccentricity. Not many, but some, people behaved in very odd ways, and their oddity was apparently accepted without much fuss. There is something marvelous about this, an open-hearted tolerance for the outer limits of harmless, or even somewhat harmful, weirdness; a deep attitude of live and let live.  I find our modern age rigidly conformist, especially in the arts. Groups in society at large have sorted themselves into monoliths, and the arts in particular foster a compulsive mutual agreement. To be a Post-Contemporary artist is to swim against the tide. It assumes a degree of nonconformity from the outset. And so the members of the current figurative and Post-Contemporary communities are among the most tolerant artists I know. They have the confidence in who they are to accept others being different. I am proud to belong to a community in which eccentricity may still be found, and is embraced.  ""I didn't get into the art world for the personalities."" No, I suppose I didn't either. I got into it because I love art and make art. So the personalities were a bonus. It is a bonus that I am surrounded by so much love, respect, amity, and support. It is a bonus that I am warmly greeted when I walk into a room of artists in my community. There is none of the false good cheer or angry sucking-up I see in the dominant art culture. My own happiness at seeing others in my community is no less genuine. I take joy in following their work. I learn from it and am inspired by it. I am delighted at their successes, even when I envy those successes; and when I can have a part to play in helping them along, I play it gladly. I am acquaintances with most, friends with some, and share bonds of love with a very few. But I never cease to be grateful for having found such fine companionship. It is for them that I am kicking up (I hope) such a fuss here. To address you directly now, you Post-Contemporary painters of various stripes. Understand this: you have already won. There are several fields of competition for the success of artistic movements. Among them are the validation of the establishment, and the adoration of the people. We have persuaded the people. Don't look at the metrics where gate-keepers retain control. Look at the crudely democratic ones. Compare the relative numbers of followers on social media. Compare the magazine circulation numbers. Compare the rates of establishment of new colleges. We make the work that other people want to look at, and learn to make themselves. The Post-Contemporary has stirred here and there for many years now. But through the cold night of the twentieth century, painters following the path of what has become the Post-Contemporary remained isolated and alone. Even ten or twenty years ago, it was not yet time.  The explosion of social media has pushed the Post-Contemporary from the ever-receding future into the crisp, bright present. That same sorting tendency of Internet-driven socializing which has done so much damage to the country overall, has shown its other, positive, face for us. Suddenly, it is very easy to look up the kind of art you like, and to contact artists directly. Many of us at the older end of the age range recall teachers and professors making us think we were the only one left who wanted to paint stuff to look like stuff. This cruel illusion has been punctured by Facebook and Instagram. One must merely post something well-drawn or well-painted, and fans by the thousands coalesce and begin to discuss ideas and opinions. Suddenly the embittered loneliness of the representational painter is obsolete.  We have persuaded the people, and the establishment is getting older and grayer. It is a clot in the aorta of art, glued in place with a tremendous amount of money. But trends are trends, and the clot must soon break up, and be swept away. Given these facts, I think it is time the broad swath of us began to reckon with the responsibilities and opportunities of having won. First of all, we must come to terms with our experience on the outside. This is an experience which has impoverished us, and crippled us, and often made us doubt our work and our worth. Many of us lost decades, and not all of us lived to see the far side of it. But it is coming to a close and we have to decide what to do with it. There is a spectrum of possible approaches. I don't know which is right, and we don't all have to agree. For myself, I aspire to the one described so eloquently by Oscar Wilde as he considered his imprisonment, in De Profundis: ""But while there were times when I rejoiced in the idea that my sufferings were to be endless, I could not bear them to be without meaning. Now I find hidden somewhere away in my nature something that tells me that nothing in the whole world is meaningless, and suffering least of all. That something hidden away in my nature, like a treasure in a field, is Humility. ""It is the last thing left in me, and the best: the ultimate discovery at which I have arrived, the starting-point for a fresh development. It has come to me right out of myself, so I know that it has come at the proper time. It could not have come before, nor later. Had any one told me of it, I would have rejected it. Had it been brought to me, I would have refused it. As I found it, I want to keep it. I must do so. It is the one thing that has in it the elements of life, of a new life, VITA NUOVA for me. Of all things it is the strangest. One cannot acquire it, except by surrendering everything that one has. It is only when one has lost all things, that one knows that one possesses it. ""Now I have realised that it is in me, I see quite clearly what I ought to do; in fact, must do. And when I use such a phrase as that, I need not say that I am not alluding to any external sanction or command. I admit none. I am far more of an individualist than I ever was. Nothing seems to me of the smallest value except what one gets out of oneself. My nature is seeking a fresh mode of self-realisation. That is all I am concerned with. And the first thing that I have got to do is to free myself from any possible bitterness of feeling against the world."" Each element of this formulation strikes me as so correct, and so appropriate, and so productive. Indeed, let what we suffered be not meaningless. Let us learn from having had nothing, that it is in the midst of nothing one identifies the inalienable. Let us identify that humility and its companion, hunger, are inalienable, and never cease being humble or hungry in our work - let us strive always to be great, and understand that we will never be good enough. Let us seek new forms of self-realization. And let us not be bitter against the world. So miserable as we were, those who stood against us were more miserable still. We were consoled by the wisdom we inherited and built upon, but they had nothing to console them, and their chill went straight to the bone.  When it is time - and it is not yet time - let us be kind to those who were merciless toward us.8 They were bad people, but they sometimes made good work. We have had our good work rejected and destroyed; if we should earn power once again, we mustn't become the kind of savage who tormented us when we had none. -- I know a painter, who I suppose would call herself Post-Contemporary, who is of a pugnacious character and angrily rounded on me at a bar. She said to me, ""My work isn't new or important, and isn't meant to be. I do what I like and I'm lucky to be able to sell it and feed my family. Why do you have to go making it out to be anything more?"" She said this, and it is true that she has not been a painter for long and will, later on, be better than she is now. But what she paints now are haunting and dreamlike images of herself and the people she cares about, in gray abandoned landscapes, cut off and adrift from the world. There is a muted anxiety to them, and the kind of daytime silence in which you can hear the blood beat against your eardrums.  She is still bitter against the world, and part of her bitterness results from applying the Contemporary paradigm of criticism to Post-Contemporary work. It is true that she has created no new medium, nor torn down any received wisdom. But it is not true that her work is not new or important. She has reached an arm down into the storm drain of her soul, and groped around until her fingers touched something, something awful. She scrabbled about until she grasped that awful thing, and brought it up, and showed it first to herself, and then to us. It was her fear, a fear that is uniquely hers, but which, once she made it visible, we recognized as belonging to us as well. Without creativity, she could not have reached down into her soul. Without empathy, she would not have brought out what was there or wanted to give it away. And without skill, she could not have made it visible.  Her work begins the way literature begins. It will get better as she practices. It does not change everything, but most things don't - that is a Contemporary demand. It is not the finest art ever made - that is a Contemporary expectation (and one they never met). There can be nothing more new and important than the work of this self-dismissing painter that I know. -- As we relinquish our bitterness, we face two necessities.  The first is that we must develop a new culture of critique. We are remarkably good at giving and taking technical critique - at discussing how well a thing was painted, from the rawest technical aspect to the most abstract compositional principle. This is a wartime model of critique, a starvation model. It is important to preserve it, but letting it be most or all of our critique is stunting us as artists. We need to reckon with our work at the level of art just as intensely and continuously. This includes learning from the best of what modernity and post-modernity produced. I, and you, may have problems with the ideology that defined this long period, but its accomplishments and ambitions are not to be dismissed. I know that many of you do not, and I apologize for belaboring the obvious. We need always to be looking at Post-Contemporary work and saying: Is it good art? If so, how and why? If not, why not and what is missing? When our own work falls short and our peers tell us, we must develop skin thick enough to suck it up and learn whatever there is to be learned and still be friends in the morning. There is a reason we were so easily drummed out of the mainstream of culture, and our fatally weak culture of critique has allowed that reason to persist. If we do not address our core flaw, we will fail ourselves and our public a second time. We must do better. The second necessity is that we must be good ambassadors. My acquaintance in the mainstream art world, the one who said there was nothing I could accomplish in his sector by tailoring my presentation - well, maybe he had it right. I don't know all the people he knows. I only know the ones I know. Among them, being nice has rarely done me wrong. I have sometimes been taken for a fool or a nobody, because I was nice. And I will gladly admit to being a fool and a nobody. But the overwhelming majority of cases went the other way. Whenever I could get in the room and present myself and my work, I have always found much less resistance to what I do, especially among artists, than the overall tenor of this article suggests. I believe much of my own part in this open reception resulted from simple friendliness. I believe that each of us should be ready to discuss his or her work, ready to listen, and ready to extend a hand - not obsequiously, but with self-respect, and confidence, and good cheer. If we believe in what we do, this is our responsibility, and it is frequently a happy one. For Artists Who Are Not Post-Contemporary All of this is for you as well. You know me. Let me tell you the truth: I hide from people who are making work I don't like. I can't bear to lie, and I hate to say I don't like work. So I hide from people who make work I don't like. Since you know me, and we have talked about your work, you can be assured that there was something to your work that I liked. And I am telling you the truth now as well: this essay and this set of ideas are for you too. When you asked me to discuss your work with you, and we talked about it, you told me that you found what I had to say useful. I think the reason I was able to be of use to you is that I did not apply my own aesthetic categories to your work. I sought out your categories, and compared the work to its ambitions and context. I believe in discovering the aesthetic paradigm in which an artwork locates itself, and evaluating the work in light of that paradigm. So how is it that I am writing this broadside against, it would seem, everything that you do? Of course, I think that I am not; this is my sincere position - that even if my logic would seem to militate against my acceptance of your work, I personally welcome your work with gladness.  As far as aesthetics go, I have trained myself to be very open to systems that are different from mine. Your aesthetic system isn't my problem. As I have been saying, its politics are. Many of you - most, even - are working under a political regime in which my work is simply unacceptable. This is bad for me, but it's not good for you either. I'll explain. Skilled work - the humble and glorious craft of making work well - and let us not pretend we don't know what that means, that we are confused, in some cute way, as to whether De Kooning paints as well as Titian - skilled work is taboo in your world. Certainly you are permitted to display skill, but only if you have heaped an appropriate amount of calumny on it. It is extraordinarily difficult to calibrate the relative intensities of calumny and skill. On top of that, it takes a very special personality to develop real skill, and also to embrace its damnation. We may call this strange combination the Currin Paradox. Far more common among Contemporary artists is simply to avoid getting too close to the taboo. This has, however, unfortunate effects. At the most basic level, it runs counter to the spirit of art, which is that you follow your creativity. Inside the vast terrain of art, it is illegitimate to cordon off territory and warn, ""not here."" That having been done, however, certain skews are introduced. The artist is forced into a toxic chain of lies - and I am moving here from addressing artists I know, to describing the ones I purposely avoid - as I was saying, these artists are forced into a toxic chain of lies. They are aware, at a deep gut level, that good work demands skill. Once the artist has denied skill, they become very defensive about it. They know that the lack of skill is a defect in their work, so they seek strategies for addressing or sidestepping the problem.  One is to over-emphasize the role of irony in the work, to make art badly or awkwardly on purpose. Ironism is not a common or particularly healthy feature of the human personality. Art does not attract a disproportionate number of ironists. It attracts a disproportionate number of very sincere and attached people. There is no bitter ironist like the ironist who started from a place of sincerity. The art world is currently a factory for this type of ironist: people who were denied at school a grounding in skill, and who have distorted the message of their art to accommodate the crippled state of their abilities.  There is a social dimension to the toxic chain of lies as well. The contemporary artist who has accepted the ethos of deskilling naturally resents an artist who has not accepted it. The deskilled artist becomes an enforcer of the anti-skill program, because if they can't have permission to be skilled, nobody else is getting it either.  Irony is one escape from the denial of skill. Conceptualism, and more generally art minimizing or eliminating the work of the hand, also has an unnaturally foregrounded position in Contemporary art: work made by machines, work subcontracted to domestic factory assistants or faraway Chinese laborers, work involving sitting in a chair for a long time or somebody shooting you in the arm. There is a real place for the conceptual and the detached in art, but as with irony, it has come to dominate because it serves to paper over a lack of skill. Art does not naturally appeal to the bloodless and analytic personality. It appeals to people who never got tired of Elmer's glue and popsicle sticks and plasticine and pipe cleaners. Savonarola, in his wildest dreams, could not have stripped the carnality, the sensuality, the profoundly erotic work of the hand, out of art the way that a century of tenured eunuchs have managed. This alienation, and its resultant personal and artistic neuroses, constitutes the surface layer of contemporary art. But beneath that surface, there is another story. Most of the contemporary artists I know thirst for skill, and easily return to admiring it and everything it makes possible, and tend to quietly attend life drawing workshops. Thus, I say to all contemporary artists who are suffering quietly and in shame: I am here to offer you permission. I am giving you back your permission to become skilled. Your work has become asymmetrical, because your craving for skill went unfulfilled. I am giving you permission to breathe, to spread out, to grow into the artist you wanted to become. But you must give me something in return. You have let a lot of things go in your art, because they would have brought you too close to the taboo. You have bought into a lot of very bad ideas, because they told you that your work was going fine, when you knew it wasn't. You have, in public, become very dismissive toward skilled work, because you were secretly afraid that your work would look bad beside it on a wall. Your taste has been determined by a lack of confidence in what you were doing. What I want from you in return for my permission is your complacence, and your bad ideas, and your lack of confidence. It is time to challenge the limits of your capabilities, and to think clearly and simply and honestly, and to take responsibility for your work without clearing the field of anything you worry might compete with it. This is why you got into art in the first place. I don't want you to make work that looks like my work. I want you to make work that looks like your work. Some of you are doing a very good job inside the system of artificial constraints your politics have placed on you. But this is not the same as becoming yourself. You didn't get into art to navigate a theoretical minefield, or to destroy. You got into art because of a passion for creation. I don't want to change one petal of your passion. I am not the mutilator that your professors were. And fortunately, your politics are separable from your aesthetics. Many of you have not made your art yet. But you might, and I believe you will. For Everyone This article, and this movement, are for everyone. One of the many bad ideas of modernity is that one must join a very exclusive high priesthood in order to understand art. This is a lie, and not only a lie, but a damned lie. If an artwork requires an accompanying text in order to be appreciated at all, then it is a failure. Once Stanley Kubrick had the power not to give interviews, he stopped giving interviews, explaining that his work should speak for itself. Kubrick had the right idea. Note that an advanced understanding of cinematic grammar and aesthetics yields an almost unbelievable wealth of ideas and revelations in Kubrick's oeuvre. His art rewards specialized study. But it does not require it. Anyone can walk in off the street and watch Paths of Glory or 2001 or Full Metal Jacket and have a complete experience of a functional artwork: comprehensible, captivating, and enlightening. Contemporary art fails in this respect. Observe the dismay of ordinary people walking into the contemporary section of an art museum. Note how they become bored, how their pace speeds up. This is an art of hostility, of purposeful alienation of its audience. This is art that says, ""I am important, and you are not; what I have to offer is not for the likes of you."" But the squalid truth is that this is a pose. The work has nothing to offer. This is tragically insufficient. Art is so important to humanity that we virtually date the emergence of humanity itself to the production of aesthetic objects. That combination of skilled intention, and material uselessness, is a key quality anthropologists seek in ever-more-ancient artifacts. The so-called fertility goddess no less than the adze distinguishes us from our animal ancestors. The material insufficiency of the world, and the bare cruelty of humanity and too-short life, acts to imprison us in a tiny cage of triviality and tedium. Art is an exit from this cage, a message from a gigantic plane, from a region of insight and beauty which, just as much as entropy, is our common inheritance. Without art, our access to that plane is diminished or cut off. The part of our soul which responds to it shrivels and may die. The vicious nihilism of art doctrine in the twentieth century sought this outcome. In part, it succeeded; it destroyed the popular art-appreciation culture of America and Europe. But the twentieth century is over, and this, among its many poisons, must not be permitted to sicken the twenty-first.  This essay and these ideas are for everyone - for every one of you - because it is time to give art back to you. Art is not owned by collectors, nor scholars, nor even by artists. Art is an impulse inborn in every human breast. The art object acts only to summon it, to nurture it, and to educate it. Art as an institution has neglected this sacred privilege for a century, but that neglect is coming to an end. The Post-Contemporary is for you. It is too late for the institutional Contemporary, but it is not too late for you, or for me, or for us. Thus we begin. -- NOTES Because of the limits of the Huffington blogging platform, the notes above may be reached by clicking on the superscript numbers. x"
BUSINESS,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin tumbled 18 percent on Tuesday to a four-week trough close to $11,000, after reports that a ban on trading of cryptocurrencies in South Korea was still an option drove fears grew of a wider regulatory crackdown. Bitcoin’s slide triggered a massive selloff across the broader cryptocurrency market, with biggest rival Ethereum down 23 percent on the day, according to trade website Coinmarketcap, and the next-biggest, Ripple, plunging 33 percent. South Korean news website Yonhap reported that Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon had told a local radio station that the government would be coming up with a set of measures to clamp down on the “irrational” cryptocurrency investment craze. South Korea had said on Monday that its plans to ban virtual coin exchanges had not yet been finalized, as government agencies were still in talks to decide how to regulate the market. Bitcoin slid on the latest news, trading as low as $11,191.59 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, down 18 percent on the day, for a short period putting the digital currency on track for its biggest one-day fall in three years. “It’s mainly been regulatory issues which are haunting the cryptocurrency, with news around South Korea’s further crackdown on trading the driver today,” said Think Markets chief strategist Naeem Aslam, who holds what he described as “substantial” amounts of bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple. “But we maintain our stance. We do not think that the complete banning of cryptocurrencies is possible,” he said. Cryptocurrencies enjoyed a bumper year in 2017 as mainstream investors entered the market and as an explosion in so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs) - digital token-based fundraising rounds - drove demand for bitcoin and Ethereum, the second-biggest digital unit. The latest tumble leaves bitcoin down more than 40 percent from the record high around $20,000 it hit in mid-December, wiping about $130 billion off its “market cap” - the unit price multiplied by the total number of bitcoins that have been released into the market. The news from South Korea came as it emerged a senior Chinese central banker had said authorities should ban centralized trading of virtual currencies as well as individuals and businesses that provide related services, according to an internal memo from a government meeting seen by Reuters. Bloomberg reported on Monday that Chinese authorities plan to block domestic access to Chinese and offshore cryptocurrency platforms that allow centralized trading. ″(It) seems like it’s uncertainty spooking the markets,...with regulations unclear,” said Charles Hayter, founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare. ”(Traders) are taking profits on the increased risk scenarios going forward.” A director at Germany’s central bank said on Monday that any attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies must be on a global scale as national or regional rules would be hard to enforce on a virtual, borderless community. By 1000 GMT bitcoin was trading down 16 percent on the day at around $11,500 on Bitstamp."

ARTS & CULTURE,"In an effort to organize counter-programming during President-elect Donald Trump’s inaugural festivities, a bevy of bands big and small will perform protest concerts benefiting organizations such as Planned Parenthood this weekend. One such group, a self-described “feminist hardcore punk band” aptly called War on Women, will perform an acoustic show Sunday in Washington, D.C. Their lyrics ― bluntly worded, logically argued dismissals of the patriarchy ― also apparently make for great protest posters. At least, that’s what artist Hexelot has showed us with her latest project, which turns the messages delivered by one of her favorite bands into visual rallying cries. “I just really wanted to celebrate all women,” Hexelot told The Huffington Post in an email. “Whether that be women of color, women not born biologically female, women that practice religion outside Christianity. All women.” The artist chose lyrics that she thought “really focused on the angst and frustration one can feel as a woman” but that were “still hopeful about the future.” “I don’t want to flatter myself by saying I’m making their lyrics more powerful,” she said. “I think I just emphasized their original message by showing who this message is for.” Lyrics like “Give! Us! The! Pill!” and “We are not weak, we are brave” are graced with girlish flourishes like hearts and exclamation marks in the works “because it made the drawings look a little gooey and traditionally (as much as I hate this word) ‘girly,’” Hexelot said, adding that she hoped to flip “the preferred image of women looking and acting a certain way.” “I hear a lot of groups make songs nowadays that talk about equal rights, which is great, but the songs are always so calm,” Hexelot said. Calm is not her speed. She’s concerned that there is no space to discuss and validate “true anger” of gender inequality, lest the women expressing it be labeled “feminazis” or otherwise not taken seriously. “My overall hope for what people take away from my drawings and the music is that they don’t need to remain silent,” she added. A timely message heading into the forthcoming march."
ARTS & CULTURE,"You oughta know that your favorite ‘90s woman rocker is headed for the theatre.  Alanis Morissette, whose Grammy-winning album “Jagged Little Pill” you’ve probably wailed along to with a hairbrush mic, will have her album adapted into a musical next spring.  Diane Paulus ― of “Hair” and “Finding Neverland” fame ― will head up the production, and “Juno” writer Diablo Cody is writing the book. According to a press release, Cody and Morissette are basing the musical’s story on “a modern and multi-generational family and their complex dynamics, touching on issues of gender identity and race.” “The chemistry between all of us is crackling and I feel honored to be diving into these songs again,” Morissette said in a statement. And yes, hits like “Ironic” and “Hand in My Pocket” will be worked into the musical, which will premiere May 2018 in Cambridge, Massachusetts."
POLITICS,"Advisers to President Donald Trump declined on Sunday to rule out that women other than porn star Stormy Daniels received money to keep silent about alleged affairs with the businessman-turned-politician. Rudy Giuliani, who recently joined the president’s legal team, said he was unaware of any other such payments brokered by Trump attorney Michael Cohen, but he left a wide door open for them. “I have no knowledge of that, but I would think if it was necessary, yes,” Giuliani told George Stephanopoulos in an interview on ABC’s “This Week” about the possibility.  Speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union,” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said she didn’t personally know about payments other than the one to Daniels, though she added an important caveat. If such payments were made, “They didn’t cross my desk as campaign manager” in the 2016 election, Conway told Jake Tapper. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said she had an affair with Trump in 2006, after he’d married his wife Melania and a son was born to the couple. Daniels signed a nondisclosure agreement regarding the alleged affair and accepted $130,000 from Cohen just before Trump won the White House. Trump has denied the affair occurred. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, created a controversy for the president last week when he acknowledged publicly that Trump reimbursed Cohen for the payment. Trump had previously denied knowing about the hush money, though Conway now is saying he meant that he was unaware of the payment when it occurred.  The payment may have comprised an illegal campaign donation if Cohen made it in order to protect Trump’s campaign from scandal.  Giuliani has claimed that the payment was made to Daniels not for the sake of Trump’s candidacy but to shield his family from adverse and hurtful publicity. Giuliani has called the payment a personal matter rather than a political one for the president.  As for similar potential payments to women, Giuliani said Cohen would have made them as someone who handled business for Trump. “He made payments for the president,” Giuliani said. “He conducted business for the president.”"

You will soon have a chance to see these and plenty more beloved creatures in the flesh ― or rather, in the fuzz ― thanks to a comprehensive Jim Henson exhibition headed, permanently, to the Museum of Moving Image (MOMI) in New York.  The Museum launched a Kickstarter campaign on Tuesday, calling on all Henson buffs to help raise $40,000 to realize the creatively named “Jim Henson Exhibition” in all its glory. And boy did they deliver. In just two days, the museum met its initial mark. We can officially say, the show will happen.  Now they’re hoping to reach their “stretch goal” of $100,000, in order to welcome even more bug-eyed creatures with squeezable noses and unruly mops of hair into their new Queens home.  The permanent MOMI exhibition was first announced in 2013, with help from $2.75 million in backing from New York City, a place many muppets would have called home if they could talk. “Many of the Muppets who you’ve come to love were made right here in New York City,” Jim’s daughter Cheryl Henson said at the time. “They were sewn, glued, designed and built right here.” The money helped fund a 2,200-square-foot gallery on the museum’s second floor and ensure that it is puppet-proof.  Given the fact that the Jim Henson’s Creature Shop is based in Queens, the setting was a perfect spot for the muppets to settle down in.  This next round of fundraising is geared toward the restoration of the puppets themselves, around 40 of which will appear in the exhibition. The crop is any puppet-head’s dream come true, featuring original beasties from all the Henson classics: we’re talking “Sesame Street,” “The Muppet Show,” “Fraggle Rock,” “The Dark Crystal” and “Labyrinth.” The delicate creatures are to be spruced up by designers and builders at Henson’s legendary Creature Shop, where they’ll be preserved for future generations to ogle, as well.  If you’re not based in New York, worry not, a traveling version of “The Jim Henson Exhibition: Imagination Unlimited” is also slated to go on tour, starting off at Seattle’s Museum of Pop Culture on May 20.  Clarification: The Center for Puppetry Arts, based in Atlanta, also received a major donation from the family of Jim Henson and has a permanent exhibit devoted to Henson on view. The two exhibitions are not related. "
POLITICS,"President Donald Trump swiftly defended Tomi Lahren as an “outstanding and respected young woman” after the Fox News contributor said fellow diners at a restaurant pelted her with water and obscenities. “Everybody is with Tomi Lahren, a truly outstanding and respected young woman!” Trump tweeted Wednesday morning, shortly after Lahren talked about her weekend experience at a Minneapolis restaurant on “Fox and Friends.” Everybody is with Tomi Lahren, a truly outstanding and respected young woman! @foxandfriends Video posted on social media shows Lahren getting heckled by diners at the restaurant, with some calling her a racist and yelling. As Lahren walks away, a woman appears to sling water at her back from a glass of water. Lahren said the restaurant patrons’ behavior was “not something that I’m not used to,” and admitted it was embarrassing, especially with her mother there. “You don’t have to like me, you don’t have to agree with my political opinions, but you don’t have the right to throw things at me,” she said. “But again, I’m tough, I can handle it.” Comedian Kathy Griffin also stuck up for Lahren against those at the restaurant. She tweeted on Tuesday night that she “couldn’t disagree more” with Lahren, but she has a right to her views. “The first amendment is a beautiful thing,” Griffin added. I couldn’t disagree more with @TomiLahren, but I don’t think it’s cool to resort to physical actions to make your point. The first amendment is a beautiful thing - use it. https://t.co/Yx8obh0aH0 Lahren, who joined Fox News as a contributor last summer, has gained a reputation as a polarizing figure, with her controversial political views on subjects including immigration, gun control, and abortion igniting fierce debate and opposition."
ARTS & CULTURE,"The art world is a swiftly flowing river. The currents shove every artist along, indiscriminately, at a fast clip. A few pass by twice while most flow through only once. Sometimes, an artist can get lodged along the riverbank, snagged onto a hold. Sometimes that ""new land"" grows into a promontory. Most times, the pull of the river yanks an artist back into the flow and out of our sight, never to be seen again.  That said, I still don't understand why Masami Teraoka is not better known. His talent is unbelievable and incredible and worthy of our rapt attention. Not only is his technical skill exemplary, his interests and ideas are smart, fascinating, entertaining and with varying degrees of humor. He is a quiet warrior. I love the guy. Most of you will never know that his show at the Honolulu Museum of Art is titled ""Feast of Fools: The Triptych Paintings of Masami Teraoka."" As an artist once based in Los Angeles, we were always having a never-ending dialogue on the benefits or detriments of moving to New York, the art world citadel of the universe. Los Angeles based artists would never have the advantages and attentions that a New York artist would. From the Sixties to the recent present, this has been a much talked about topic. (Today, New York no longer seats the art world, a revolution of city gentrification, the fun of art party fairs and the easy-access of the internet.)  Within the language of the art world, if LA is backcountry, then how far removed is Waimãnalo?! Teraoka lives on the Hawai'i island of O'ahu. These islands are remote. Messages are still sent by ship and bottle.  Whatever the reasons, Masami Teraoka is sublime in every way.  Following are some fascinating insights from curators, editors, columnists and contemporary artists. Below, they ponder the question, ""Why isn't Masami Teraoka more famous?"" ""We were neighbors, in Baja Santa Monica, on Main Street, way back when. His studio became Wolfgang Puck's restaurant. I saw a show, a year or two back, at Sam Freeman's (Santa Monica gallery). I knew him, but not well. I'll bet Gajin Fujita knows him.""

All that bright color went dark. Golden. Brown..."" Fujita laughs with self-knowledge, ""Shakin' his skeltons!"" I know. I mean, I dunno... He's the quintessential artist. He's original. He doesn't paint for others. He paints for himself. He's not bombarded from..."" The street-influenced artist pauses and laughs loudly sayin', ""He'd be doin' some crazy ass shit!"" We both laugh, knowing that Teraoka is an iconoclast and a sleek fighter. Fujita continues, ""I kneeled before him many times.""

""The question is a curious one. Being an art world player is different than being a great artist. Understanding how a community and system works doesn't make one a good or bad artist necessarily, just that you understand the rules of which professionals in a certain group function and how to navigate that either for the advantage of oneself or one's cause. What makes a good artist is defined by each of us singly, something like a consensus (something like fame) is reached over time, but this is usually only half-right and generally in a state of pretty much being constantly rewritten until that generation no longer feels relevant to the present one, and even then small gangs of scholars will argue for millenia if allowed to. These works by Masami Teraoka, that I've only seen on a screen, look beautifully wrought. It would surprise me if Masami didn't have financial support to continue the work, and in the end, what more could any artist ask for.""

 ""(I) don't know why he isn't more famous but at one time, in the early 1990's, he burst on to the scene like a fireball. His Japanese print parody style was the biggest sensation the art world had experienced in a long time and he seemed destined to be at the very top for eternity... To me he is.""
Greg Escalante
Curator and Co-Founder of Juxtapoz Art Magazine ""We have represented Masami Teraoka's work since 1997. I was first introduced to his work while studying art history at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1980s and it had made a strong impression on me at the time. I remain incredibly honored to work with him.
 
""There is a lot to say about Teraoka's practice, the way the ideas conveyed in his work anticipate concepts like globalism, for example. And there is a lot to say about Teraoka himself. How brave he has been to abandon the ukiyo-e based works on paper that made him so visible as an artist in the 1980s for a style that is in a more western tradition and rendered in oil on panel or canvas. Teraoka also engages with extremely challenging topics that not everyone is comfortable discussing let alone seeing depicted in an artwork, such as the sex abuse scandal in the Catholic church.
 
""As I am sure you are aware, the art world is fickle, and yesterday's rock star is often tomorrow's busker. The reverse is trie as well. Teraoka has had his moments of stardom, like his 1979 solo exhibit at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Many a curator has told me that someone should do a career retrospective, and whomever chooses to undertake that exhibit would put his/her name on the map in so doing. I certainly hope that will happen and there is no doubt that Teraoka's work and career, now spanning more than four decades, merits that kind of thoughtful and in depth consideration.
 
""In the mean time, I continue to pursue other exhibition opportunities for him. Teraoka has a solo exhibit titled Feast of Fools consisting of newer work and opening at the Honolulu Museum of Art, Friday, May 29. A survey exhibit of his work will open at Cal State Fullerton in 2016 with an attendant catalogue.  The exhibit will travel to the Crocker Art Museum, Sacramento. They just acquired a significant work from Teraoka's AIDS Series, which is currently on exhibit in their contemporary gallery. Catharine Clark Gallery (my gallery) presented a solo, retrospective of his work from the 1960s to the present during Miami Basel at The Miami Project last December, and placed several works in museum collections and in significant private collections. But yes, Teraoka should be better and more widely known. I have confidence that will be the case in coming years.""

 ""I think the word ""famous"" is quite a subjective term. It is one that is constantly changing in the contemporary art world, very much in reaction to the larger arts ecosystem of the market, what influential critics are writing for noted publications, the power of passionate collectors on the sidelines willing to offer the kind of financial support that is needed these days to mount major museum exhibitions and working with ""tastemaker"" curators. Undeniably, I think Masami, who I have the pleasure to also call a long-time friend, is extremely well-represented in major institutional collections around the world, including the Met, Tate Modern, Singapore Art Museum, LACMA and our very own Honolulu Museum of Art. To my knowledge he is really the only artist living and working in Hawai'i today who is routinely sold in auctions run by 'The Big Three' (Christie's, Sotheby's and Bonhams). Unfortunately, nationally and particularly internationally, there is very little awareness on contemporary artists from and/or working in Hawai'i. When I'm attending global art events or at a conference, whether in London, Hong Kong, New York, Venice, or Dubai, I often get into conversation with someone and Hawai'i inevitably comes up (particularly over the past year as we build up momentum for Honolulu Biennial 2017) and on the rare occasion that the person I am speaking with does have some awareness on Hawai'i's art scene, most of the time, their only reference point is Masami Teraoka or POW!WOW!""

 ""I agree, Masami should be more famous for his body of work and I don't know why he isn't. Maybe his more recent Catholic works are too angry or shocking? It's hard to believe that's the case in our day, but perhaps. In any case I'm a life long fan of his work.""

POLITICS,"DORAL, Fla. – The United States has never had kings, dukes or even barons, but President Donald Trump’s most loyal subjects have found a way to pay him millions of dollars in tribute anyway. New Jersey Republican congressman Tom MacArthur spent $15,221 to hold a fundraiser at Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, according to a HuffPost analysis of Federal Election Commission filings. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican and a close Trump ally in the House, spent $689 for an office Christmas party at Trump’s hotel a few blocks from the White House. The Illinois-based Family PAC paid $3,183 to Trump’s hotel in Chicago to hold a conference there. And the Republican National Committee this week will likely spend in the neighborhood of a half-million dollars at Trump’s resort in Doral, a few miles west of downtown Miami, for its spring meeting — not counting hundreds or even thousands of dollars RNC members must pay out of their own pockets for airfare, hotel rooms and some meals. The golf resort boasts plenty of ornate chandeliers and baroque fountains — but lies directly beneath the flight path of Miami International Airport’s takeoffs and landings, and is miles from the closest beach. RNC members said they like it anyway, even if it means that some of their own money winds up in the president’s pockets. “Well, we elected a president who’s a businessman,” noted one RNC member on condition of anonymity. “A shrewd businessman.” Cindy Siddoway, the RNC committeewoman from Idaho, said she didn’t know how the RNC settled on Trump’s golf resort but had no objection. “I don’t have a have a problem with it,” she said. “It’s a lovely hotel.” In all, some 70 Republican candidates and parties from Washington state to Washington, D.C., have spent $1.9 million of their donors’ money at the president’s golf courses, hotels and restaurants thus far this election cycle. A portion of every one of these dollars enriches Trump and his family personally. “If you are a politician who, A, has no principles and, B, wants Donald Trump’s endorsement, then of course you will want to host your fundraising event at a Trump property,” said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, an open-government advocacy group that has successfully sued Trump for access to White House visitor logs. “There’s no better way to appeal to the transactional president, no better way to make a mark with the no-attention-span president.” One GOP official, on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the unsavoriness of funneling donor money to the president and his family but said that ― given Trump’s brazenness about profiting from his presidency — the party had essentially given up. “In terms of the optics of it? We’re way past that at this point,” the official said.  For years, the entire system of donors with financial interest in particular legislation and regulations giving campaign contributions to candidates who will then craft those same laws and regulations has been derided as corrupt and tantamount to legalized bribery. But candidates must abide by strict rules on what they can and cannot do with that money. Using it to personally enrich themselves is illegal. Trump’s refusal to divest himself of his hotels and golf courses — despite his promises to do so during the campaign — has made it possible for Republican candidates and parties to put money directly into his pocket. “It’s a scary reality when we’re discussing whether the president is susceptible to the influence of people paying him while president, but it is our current reality,” said Jordan Libowitz of the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which has sued Trump for violating the constitutional prohibition from taking payments from foreign and domestic government officials. The biggest source of GOP money flowing to Trump’s properties is the Republican National Committee, which essentially went under the control of Trump since his election in 2016. Through its March filing, it has spent $763,335 at Trump properties since Jan. 1, 2017. That includes $106,646 for a dinner at Trump’s Washington hotel in January, $224,858 for a weekend of meetings and fundraisers at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in March and $237,310 in advance payments to Trump’s Doral golf resort for this week’s spring meeting. In past meetings, the RNC would typically pay half of the total cost of the event beforehand, and the remainder afterward. The next biggest spender at Trump properties is the president’s re-election campaign, which is wholly under the president’s direct control. Thus far it has funneled $551,643 of its donors’ money to his hotels and golf resorts as well as to Trump Tower in Manhattan, where it rents office space and buys food from Trump’s restaurants there. Other high-profile spenders include Great America Committee and America First Action, two Trump-supporting political action committees that occasionally host fundraisers at his Washington, D.C., hotel. But Trump properties also draw smaller committees as well as candidates for House and Senate races, who choose to pay the higher prices that Trump venues often charge compared to nearby competitors. Illinois’ Adam Kinzinger, Kansas’ Kevin Yoder, New York’s Peter King, California’s David Valadao and Florida’s Ted Yoho are all Republican House members who reported spending at Trump properties. Both the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee have held events at Trump properties, as did the Morris County, New Jersey, Republican Party — reportedly with dire results. After paying Trump’s Bedminster golf course $24,487 and a Fox News host $30,000 to serve as keynote speaker, the fundraiser actually wound up losing money, leaving the local party with shaky finances. Omar Navarro, a Republican who hopes to replace Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters in Los Angeles, reported spending thousands at Trump’s golf resort in Palos Verdes. He conceded that the high costs at the Trump resort ate into the total he collected, but said it was the only venue that would agree to host him. “Trump is the only place where I can hold an event without being shut down,” Navarro said. “They don’t get intimidated by fascist people who keep us from having campaign events.” He said longtime Trump confidante Roger Stone headlined his first fundraiser and former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio his second. “It’s expensive. It’s not cheap,” he said. CREW’s Libowitz said it is obvious why candidates and incumbent Republican officials alike spend money at Trump properties: in the hopes of winning Trump’s support and endorsement. “If someone wanted to try to literally buy his favor, they have a direct and legal line to do so. This is why we’ve seen a sudden influx of spending by Republican candidates and committees at Trump properties where they had not previously spent,” Libowitz said. “They have to have their events somewhere, so many may believe that allowing the president to profit off of them will give them a leg up in gaining his support.” One Republican close to the White House, though, scoffed at the idea that Trump’s political office — known for its dysfunction — had the initiative or discipline to keep track of which candidates were frequenting Trump properties. “No,” he said. “Please.” Another Republican official close to Trump, who believed that the use of Trump properties by GOP candidates was ethically troubling, agreed that Trump’s political team is not paying any mind to who is spending money at his golf courses and hotels and who is not. “I don’t know that it is noticed by anyone,” the official said. “Maybe it is.” For Corey Stewart, a U.S. Senate candidate for Virginia, time is running out for somebody in the president’s political world to notice his Trump-brand loyalty. Stewart jumped into the Senate race not long after losing the primary for the Republican nomination for Virginia governor last year. In October and November of 2017, he spent $1,422 at the Trump hotel in Washington on meals as “meeting expenses.” Stewart said he hosts get-togethers with small groups of “high-dollar donors” there – although at least on one occasion in November, he appeared to be socializing with tourists and other visitors at the bar, not meeting with donors. His FEC report for that period included a bill for $355 for that date. “I might have been just hanging out there,” he said, adding that the hotel has become a “clubhouse for conservatives” in the area. “We like to host events there because there are a lot of MAGA folks who like to meet there,” he said. Notwithstanding his frequent visits there, Stewart said he does not expect Trump to endorse him prior to the June 12 Virginia primary, in which he faces two opponents. Navarro, of Los Angeles, similarly does not expect a Trump endorsement, but said he would continue to use Trump properties. “I’d rather do business in a place where someone has my values,” he said. And — notwithstanding his own website that calls for “an end to accepting bribes” and ridding “corruption/greed” in government ― he rejects the idea that Trump is doing anything wrong by profiting from his businesses while in office. “If he’s not breaking the law, he’s not breaking the law,” Navarro said."
ARTS & CULTURE,"A Jean-Michel Basquiat painting just sold for the highest price ever paid at auction for an American artist’s work: a whopping $110.5 million. The 72-by-68-inch acrylic and oil stick “Untitled” painting of a skull by the late graffiti artist was the subject of 10 minutes of intense bidding Thursday night at a Sotheby’s auction in New York City. The opening bid of $57 million drew gasps from the audience, Bloomberg reported. Sotheby’s had estimated it would sell for at least $60 million. It was the sixth-highest amount ever paid at auction for any work of art, putting Basquiat in the rarefied company of the celebrated Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. Only 10 works have sold for more than $100 million. The successful bidder, Japanese art collector Yusaku Maezawa, an e-commerce billionaire, announced in an Instagram post showing him standing next to the work that he had “just won this masterpiece.” “When I first encountered this painting, I was struck with so much excitement and gratitude for my love of art,” he added. “I want to share that experience with as many people as possible.”  I am happy to announce that I just won this masterpiece.

Basquiat died of a heroin overdose in 1988 at the age of 27 after painting for seven years. He created the skull in 1982. It’s considered one of his most important works still in private hands. Maezawa said he plans to loan the work to institutions around the world before making it one of the centerpieces of a museum he has created in his hometown of Chiba, Japan. The businessman last year bought another 1982 Basquiat painting of a devil at a Christie’s auction for $57.3 million, which at the time was the most ever paid for a work by the artist. The Basquiat was part of a Sotheby’s Contemporary Art Evening Auction of American post-war paintings that also featured works by such artists as Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschenberg."
BUSINESS,"Bill O’Reilly — barely beyond settling a huge sexual harassment lawsuit — is negotiating for a job with the Sinclair Broadcast Group. Sinclair, in case you missed this, is the second largest television station operator in the country, dominating markets in the South and Midwest. It has been involved with Fox Broadcasting since that company’s launch in 1986 and is consistently criticized for its conservative-only news reporting. There are entire regions of our country that get no news beyond that which Sinclair provides — would that be undue political power? But I digress. So, despite Sinclair’s much-vaunted family values, sexual harassment is not a deal-breaker when it considers hiring. Does no one question this? The answer is “no” because sexual harassment has been and remains normal. When women warn each other about certain men, it isn’t with a lot of shared surprise. Such things happen everywhere, all the time: in corporations, in the armed forces, in churches, in colleges—there’s no place free from it. Harvey Weinstein is the latest predator to be outed. Because it’s show-biz and everyone loves a Hollywood scandal, there’s a lot of news coverage. Movie stars and other industry figures are coming forward saying, “Me too.” Their male counterparts who had long recognized what was going on are apologizing for not speaking up. Women, harassed years ago, are saying they are sorry for not speaking sooner. Back and forth. It’s a rush-to-regret Derby with only losers. Screenwriter Scott Rosenberg wrote a prose poem about Weinstein, his mentor of many years, and his sorrow that he got swept up in the moment, the parties, and the personal advantages. You might dismiss that as self-serving B.S. if it were not for his recurring refrain, “Everybody fucking knew.” And there you have it. Everyone does know. Weinstein’s rapacious appetite wasn’t strictly acceptable, but it was normal. It’s less than 12 months since voters blew off Donald Trump’s boasts about groping random women as normal. Among this year’s celebrity lawsuits there’s Bill Cosby (for multiple rapes), and Harvey Weinstein for couch-casting, exposing himself, and maybe rape. Mark Halperin of CNN has just been accused of asking younger female colleagues not only to sit on his lap but to do so while he had an erection. George H.W. Bush must be surprised to find himself in the line-up of living presidential offenders alongside Bill Clinton. I bet Bush had no idea that the odd butt-pat/fondle was other than warmly received. Why? Because no matter how a woman experienced it, that behavior was typical of the men he grew up with. It was normal. But also in 2017, the New York Times reported that O’Reilly and Fox News had settled five lawsuits against O’Reilly since 2002. In fact there’s a tangle of charges from various women. O’Reilly left Fox last spring, as did Fox’s CEO, Roger Ailes, who was also accused of multiple instances of sexual harassment. I don’t have a problem with anyone else’s voracious sexual appetite or their capacity for one-night stands. I do care about consent. Someone may make a come-on remark to a person they find attractive but they need to pull back quickly and gracefully if the response is less than positive. That’s the difference between sexual pursuit and predation. I realize that people in elevated positions (usually men but women too) use their standing to pressure others to sleep with them. Many friends, male and female, gay or straight, have stories of powerful people trying to intimidate them into sex. Sometimes it’s meaningless, other times it’s ugly, but it’s not necessarily coercive, just opportunistic. How you select among life’s opportunities is personal and some of the effects get muddled by subjectivity and hindsight. It may be the abuse of power, it may be sleazy, but it’s not necessarily sexual abuse. Sexual harassment is abuse when defined as an on-going hard push despite the other person’s disinterest. It’s very much abuse if the victim has to face negative consequences for not acquiescing. Groping is abuse. Rape is rape. If such abuse won’t stop (as it probably won’t in this century) there have to be consequences to at least slow the offenders. Bill O’Reilly must never work again. Probably the same goes for Mark Halperin—it’s too soon to tell. Bill Cosby should be in prison. George H.W. Bush needs to update his social skills. Bill Clinton’s wife has paid his price for him—which further disgusts me, but let’s not start on that. The boasts of sexual assault should have been a deal breaker for the American electorate, but they weren’t, and thus we have Donald Trump. He needs to be voted out. Abuse must stop being normal. The Women’s Liberation movement of the late 1960s learned a lot from the Civil Rights movement that directly preceded it. We have had some successes but many unresolved issues from that time are surfacing again. These days, we’ve had to state “Black Lives Matter” because that idea, that core principle, has yet to be established. It’s not normal. It is normal for a well-dressed black man driving an expensive car to get pulled over by the police for no reason. A casually dressed black man may be considered to be “asking for it” when he pops out to buy candy after dark—much like a woman who finds herself stranded in the wrong place. “Black Lives Matter” demands a new norm in which all people are treated according to their individual actions—just as the vast majority of white people are. African Americans are fathers, sons, husbands, lovers, uncles, senators, doctors, artists, mailmen. Their lives are important to themselves and others. They matter. I can’t help thinking that women are once more in debt to African Americans for their leadership in the struggle for personal and legal rights. White, black, or brown: women’s bodies matter. This is not one of those vapid or reactionary “All Lives Matter” comments. This is about another group of people who are subject to violence because of how they present—not their color, but their gender. Women cross the street to avoid dangerous-looking people. They don’t necessarily live in fear but they live with caution. Depending on where they are, they lock themselves in their cars or avoid certain parts of town. They throw the deadbolt in their hotel rooms. In cities, they carry pepper spray. In isolated areas, they may sleep with a pistol under their pillow. Most find strength in numbers, leery of being alone in a subway car, a public elevator, or even a college restroom. Like most African Americans, women remain polite in order to evade a threatening situation, despite any inner rage. They understand that the consequences of losing self control can be dire. I know this—I’ve been beaten up in New York City by a stranger, just for rejecting his advances. For many women the abuse is not just occasional and random but daily. They have to fear their male family members or their spouse—or their boss in a much-needed job. These may not be celebrities, more likely they are women whose names you will never know. They may be rich or poor. Class doesn’t matter, it’s gender that does—that’s what makes it normal. The right to make love or to have sex just for fun must be left up to the individual woman. No one should touch someone else’s body intimately unless invited. We all know this. Right now it’s a rule that is honored in the breach by many—boys will be boys! Now it’s time to stand up against that behavior and kick the rule-breakers to the curb. Don’t let Bill O’Reilly dominate any part of our culture again.

BUSINESS,"The Weinstein Company reportedly plans to file for bankruptcy protection after last-ditch talks to sell the studio collapsed. The company board of directors said late Sunday that bankruptcy is the only “viable option” after negotiations “concluded without a signed agreement,” according to Reuters. The board said it “has no choice but to pursue the only viable option to maximize the company’s remaining value: an orderly bankruptcy process.”  The move comes months after the departure of chairman and co-founder Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused by more than 70 women of sexual misconduct, including rape. The board had been in talks to sell the Weinstein Company to an investor group led by Maria Contreras-Sweet and backed by billionaire investor Ronald Burkle for $500 million. That deal was derailed in early February, when New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a lawsuit accusing the Weinstein Company of “repeatedly” turning a blind eye to the sexual harassment allegations against its co-founder. According to Variety, a deal still seemed possible as of Wednesday, when Schneiderman met with Contreras-Sweet and members of the Weinstein Company board in Manhattan. On Sunday, however, the Weinstein Company board broke off the talks. “We must conclude that your plan to buy this company was illusory and would only leave this Company hobbling toward its demise to the detriment of all constituents,” the board said in a letter to Burkle and Contreras-Sweet, according to Variety. “Despite your previous statements, it is simply impossible to avoid the conclusion that you have no intention to sign an agreement ― much less to close one ― and no desire to save valuable assets and jobs.” Harvey Weinstein was fired from the Weinstein Company in October, amid mounting allegations of sexual misconduct. The movie mogul, who is reportedly seeking treatment in Arizona, has denied allegations of non-consensual sex. He acknowledged in a statement last year that his behavior had “caused a lot of pain.” "

McCain released a statement just hours after Haspel went before the Senate Intelligence Committee for her confirmation hearing. In her testimony, Haspel told lawmakers that she would not restart the agency’s defunct torture program if confirmed to head the CIA, but she repeatedly dodged questions about the morality of the program. In his statement, McCain said he understood “the urgency that drove the decision” to resort to torture as a method of interrogation after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. “But as I have argued many times, the methods we employ to keep our nation safe must be as right and just as the values we aspire to live up to and promote in the world.” He continued: “I believe Gina Haspel is a patriot who loves our country and has devoted her professional life to its service and defense. However, Ms. Haspel’s role in overseeing the use of torture by Americans is disturbing. Her refusal to acknowledge torture’s immorality is disqualifying. I believe the Senate should exercise its duty of advice and consent and reject this nomination.” McCain is a fierce opponent of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques. The senator, who fought in the Vietnam War, was held in solitary confinement and tortured as a prisoner of war in Hanoi for more than five years.  Haspel, a 30-year CIA veteran and current acting director of the agency, headed up a clandestine base in Thailand, where she reportedly oversaw the interrogation of a terrorism suspect that included waterboarding. She also reportedly played a part in helping to destroy recorded tapes of the interrogations in 2005. Despite McCain’s comments, his good friend Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) announced Thursday that he would back Haspel. Graham said she “has rejected the interrogation policies of the past” and “should be confirmed as soon as possible as we live in a time of continuing threats.” At the time of Haspel’s nomination in March, McCain responded by calling the United States’ use of torture against detainees “one of the darkest chapters in American history.” Haspel’s role in the CIA’s torture program has generated bipartisan criticism on Capitol Hill. More than 100 retired and former career and non-career U.S. ambassadors sent a letter to the Senate on Wednesday expressing “serious concern” over her nomination. McCain, 81, was diagnosed with brain cancer last July and has been recovering at his Sedona, Arizona, home after undergoing surgery for an intestinal infection last month. He will likely be absent when the Senate votes on Haspel’s confirmation. This piece has been updated with Graham’s comments."
POLITICS,"Hundreds of people took to the streets in cities across the country on Monday, as part of a new movement seeking to challenge racism and poverty in America.  The Rev. William Barber II and the Rev. Liz Theoharis ― the two religious leaders spearheading The Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival ― led dozens of demonstrators at a rally and march in front of the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Monday afternoon.  Similar rallies were coordinated and held in front of state houses in over 30 states across the country, according to organizers ― from Tennessee to Massachusetts to California. Participants in D.C. sang out familiar chants from protests against racism and police brutality in recent years: “What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now.” Rev. Barber also led a variation on the chant: “What do we want? A living wage. When do we want it? Now.” Somebody’s hurting our people and it’s gone on far too long! We won’t be silent anymore! #PoorPeoplesCampaign pic.twitter.com/RNVzTciht0 Hundreds were arrested at the nonviolent rallies nationwide on Monday, according to organizers. In D.C., Barber, Women’s March leader Linda Sarsour, and dozens of others were arrested, with police leading them out of the street they were blocking in front of the Capitol to a cordoned-off area nearby.   The actions kicked off 40 days of planned demonstrations across the country by the campaign, which is meant to continue in the footsteps of Martin Luther King Jr.’s Poor People’s Campaign, cut short when King was assassinated 50 years ago. The movement’s broad demands to lawmakers include “a massive overhaul of the nation’s voting rights laws,” an end to systemic racism and support for a “living” wage, according to a release. At Monday’s D.C. rally, the reverends called for government to support “accessible” housing, healthcare and public transportation, as well as relief from “crushing student debt.” More rallies are planned each Monday for the next six weeks, with a final gathering in D.C. on June 23 ― after which organizers hope participants will continue taking action in their own states to call for legislative changes. While the campaign is expressly not partisan and does not make endorsements, it does seek to mobilize voters to the polls in the 2018 elections, a spokesperson told HuffPost last month.  “We come not with a left agenda or a right agenda. We come with a moral agenda that cares for all people,” Barber said at the D.C. rally on Tuesday. A domestic worker at the rally gave an emotional speech about her struggles living in poverty, speaking in Spanish as someone translated in English.   “I work cooking and cleaning and make 11 dollars an hour. I have suffered depression and sometimes suicidal thoughts at the thought of my children living on the streets because we can’t afford rent,” the woman said, wiping away tears. “Systematic poverty that has been created, not because we’re lazy or don’t want to work, but because of politicians who block a living wage.” See what the demonstrations across the country looked like: We shall not be moved!

BUSINESS,"Influential people have a profound impact on everyone they encounter. Yet, they achieve this only because they exert so much influence inside, on themselves. We see only their outside. We see them innovate, speak their mind, and propel themselves forward toward bigger and better things. And, yet, we’re missing the best part. The confidence and wherewithal that make their influence possible are earned. It’s a labor of love that influential people pursue behind the scenes, every single day. And while what people are influenced by changes with the season, the unique habits of influential people remain constant. Their focused pursuit of excellence is driven by eight habits that you can emulate and absorb until your influence expands: 1. They think for themselves Influential people aren’t buffeted by the latest trend or by public opinion. They form their opinions carefully, based on the facts. They’re more than willing to change their mind when the facts support it, but they aren’t influenced by what other people think, only by what they know. 2. They are graciously disruptive Influential people are never satisfied with the status quo. They’re the ones who constantly ask, “What if?” and “Why not?” They’re not afraid to challenge conventional wisdom, and they don’t disrupt things for the sake of being disruptive; they do it to make things better. 3. They inspire conversation When influential people speak, conversations spread like ripples in a pond. And those ripples are multidirectional; influencers inspire everyone around them to explore new ideas and think differently about their work. 4. They leverage their networks Influential people know how to make lasting connections. Not only do they know a lot of people, they get to know their connections’ connections. More importantly, they add value to everyone in their network. They share advice and know how, and they make connections between people who should get to know each other. 5. They welcome disagreement Influential people do not react emotionally and defensively to dissenting opinions—they welcome them. They’re humble enough to know that they don’t know everything and that someone else might see something they missed. And if that person is right, they embrace the idea wholeheartedly because they care more about the end result than being right. 6. They are proactive Influential people don’t wait for things like new ideas and new technologies to find them; they seek those things out. These early adopters always want to anticipate what’s next. They’re influential because they see what’s coming, and they see what’s coming because they intentionally look for it. Then they spread the word. 7. They respond rather than react If someone criticizes an influential person for making a mistake, or if someone else makes a critical mistake, influential people don’t react immediately and emotionally. They wait. They think. And then they deliver an appropriate response. Influential people know how important relationships are, and they won’t let an emotional overreaction harm theirs. They also know that emotions are contagious, and overreacting has a negative influence on everyone around them. 8. They believe Influential people always expect the best. They believe in their own power to achieve their dreams, and they believe others share that same power. They believe that nothing is out of reach, and that belief inspires those around them to stretch for their own goals. They firmly believe that one person can change the world. Bringing It All Together To increase your influence, you need to freely share your skills and insights, and you must be passionate in your pursuit of a greater future. Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me. Want to learn more from me? Check out my book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Kanye West’s shock tour continued Tuesday with an extremely candid interview at TMZ.  The rapper revealed to the newsroom that he was addicted to opioids and underwent liposuction in 2016 just before his mental breakdown.  “Two days before going to the hospital, I was on opioids. I was addicted to opioids,” he said in a video clip provided of the interview.  “I had plastic surgery because I was trying to look good for y’all,” West said, speaking to the TMZ staffers.  “I got liposuction because I didn’t want y’all to call me fat like y’all called Rob [Kardashian] at the wedding and made him fly home before me and Kim got married. I didn’t want y’all to call me fat so I got liposuction, right?” the rapper said. West’s liposuction admission is somewhat startling because his mother, Donda West, died shortly after undergoing a tummy tuck, breast reduction and liposuction in 2007.  After getting his procedure done, West said, he began taking opioids ― two of them a day ― and started driving to work while on them. He also said he used them on tour.  “And then my boy … and I’d always ask my boy, you know, ‘We on tour give me some weed blah, blah, blah,’ so he had to go get me the opioids,” the rapper said. “And there was talks amongst my camp like Ye’s popping pills, so when he handed them to me he said, ’You know this is used to kill genius,’ so I didn’t take it. Two days later, I’m in the hospital.”  West continued talking to the staffers, saying, “I was taking two pills a day at the time. When I left the hospital, how many pills do you think I was given? Seven!” the rapper said, raising his voice. “I went from taking two pills to taking seven. So the reason that I dropped those tweets and everything is because I was drugged the fuck out.”  In the same interview, West also told TMZ about his love for President Donald Trump and said that slavery was a “choice,” before sportswriter and podcast host Van Lathan shut the rapper down. “When you hear about slavery for 400 years ... for 400 years? That sounds like a choice,” West said. “Like, you was there for 400 years and it’s all of y’all? It’s like we’re mentally in prison. I like the word ‘prison’ because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks. It’s like slavery, Holocaust. Holocaust, Jews. Slavery is blacks. So, prison is something that unites us as one race. Blacks and whites being one race. We’re the human race,” he added. Kanye with the worst take yet ""You hear about slavery for 400 years. 400 years?! That sounds like a choice."" pic.twitter.com/jJwtByDuyH West later tweeted about his TMZ interview Tuesday evening and appeared to clarify some of his comments. Below are just a few of the tweets:  the universe has a plan. I knew that TMZ would be awesome. the reason why I brought up the 400 years point is because we can't be mentally imprisoned for another 400 years. We need free thought now. Even the statement was an example of free thought        It was just an idea once again I am being attacked for presenting new ideas pic.twitter.com/oK90WQRSST Need help with substance abuse or mental health issues?

ARTS & CULTURE,"  Lower East Side at Dusk. Photo: Jens Schott Knudsen. The Changing Face of the Lower East Side Manhattan's art scene is one that fluctuates and migrates. Watching it over time, it starts to look like a natural process, like herding patterns, or erosion: galleries pop up in neighborhoods where rents are relatively low; attracting more galleries and other businesses; rents rise and property values go up; stalwart, established galleries remain and smaller galleries start to move out, finding lower rents in a different neighborhood; the process then repeats. In the 1950s and 60s the 10th Street Galleries were established as an alternative to 57th Street. In the 1970s it was SoHo. The 1980s ushered in the era of the East Village. In the late 1990s it became all about Chelsea. And most recently, as neighborhood attractions like the Highline and the new Whitney Museum have driven up rents in Chelsea, we've seen more and more of a concentration of galleries on the more-affordable Lower East Side. Between 2010 and 2015 Artnews reported the number of galleries in the neighborhood rose from 71 to 132. Each month seems to bring news of a new gallery opening or relocating to these densely packed streets around the Bowery and Delancey Street, but there have also been major closures--such as Laurel Gitlen Gallery, shuttered in February 2016, after seven years on the Lower East Side. To examine the changing face of the neighborhood, we collected opinions from a selection of galleries--from galleries who began on the Lower East Side, to those who have moved in from other areas, or found a ""second home"" there--on why they opened up shop in the area, how they've seen the neighborhood, business, and their foot traffic change, and what differentiates the LES from other art hubs around New York.    Hales Lower East Side location. Courtesy Hales Gallery. Hales Gallery 64 Delancey Street Opened: March 2016 Hales Gallery is one of the newest to open up on the LES, with an office and viewing gallery serving as this London-based gallery's North American outpost. ""Although we've only just opened, we know the area well. It's interesting to see some of the larger New York galleries open downtown and what the expansion represents in their business. It's also brilliant to see those now establishment galleries, who begun in the area a while back, thrive. The Lower East Side feels like a multifaceted neighborhood, unlike perhaps Chelsea, which though unique in its focus has always been about one thing. In many ways it reminds me of London and specifically the East End - galleries dotted throughout a community with a shifting demographic of businesses and residents. I think all of this feeds off one another and refreshes the context for art to be viewed. ""With the increased rents in other parts of the city it's interesting to see what will happen in the existing art neighborhoods and indeed where next will become a hub. I'm keen to see what 'growth' and 'expansion' means within the LES as it can't really equate to square footage due to the infrastructure. I think this is a good thing as with galleries in other areas getting bigger by the minute hopefully those on the LES with continue their somewhat positively different ethos and approach."" -Stuart Morrison, Director, Hales Gallery    Danziger Gallery. Courtesy Danziger Gallery. Danziger Gallery 95 Rivington Street Opened: February 2016 A leading gallery devoted to photography, Danziger Gallery first opened in SoHo in 1989, moved to Upper East Side in 1996, then to Chelsea in 2004. ""Rising rents and the over-saturation of art in Chelsea"" contributed to Danziger Gallery's decision to relocate to the LES. ""Chelsea seems fatigued and the LES seems vibrant and neighborly. It is a mixed-use area. Galleries, restaurants, stores, tattoo studios. And no howling wind off the Hudson. ""The gallery business, like the world, is constantly changing. Foot traffic is less important for sales as the internet and art fairs become sales drivers. However the gallery still plays an important role in providing an in-depth look and context for the art and artists we represent."" -James Danziger    Eugene Von Bruenchenhein, King of Lesser Lands, installation view, Andrew Edlin Gallery, March 24 - May 8, 2016. Courtesy Andrew Edlin Gallery. Andrew Edlin Gallery 212 Bowery Opened: December 2015 Andrew Edlin Gallery, which focuses on self-taught artists like Eugene von Bruenchenhein and Henry Darger, moved to the LES from Chelsea last year. ""Our building in Chelsea was being razed for new condo development. On the Lower East Side, the 212 Bowery address had magic to it, fantastic location... The neighborhood has been changing with new construction projects up and down Bowery, but the LES still has some edge to it, a street vibe compared to other art neighborhoods."" -Andrew Edlin    Concept, Performance, Documentation, Language, installation view with works by Tehching Tsieh, David Wojnarovicz, Duff Scheninger, Jack Smith, Neke Carson, Vito Acconci, Mitchell Algus Gallery, February 20 - May 1, 2016.

Mitchell Algus Gallery 132 Delancey Street, 2nd floor Opened: January 2015 Mitchell Algus opened his first gallery in SoHo in 1992, moved to Chelsea in 2002, and then opened a joint venture, in 2010, Algus Greenspon, in the West Village, which he operated with Amy Greenspon. Algus opened an independent exhibition space on the Lower East Side early last year. ""The neighborhood is changing rapidly. Condos, Essex Crossing, gangs of young people roaming the streets at night. The quality of the art is all over the place (which is not necessarily a bad thing). What I mean is that there are numerous crappy galleries because the rents have (for the time being) been affordable. There are also many young galleries which are getting their act together and that means quality is all over the place with lots of student-y work. None of that bothers me. There are some quality eccentric spaces. And there are a few (not many) really good galleries, but it is not like Chelsea where all the 'good galleries' show it with the 'power', attitude and obvious cost of their spaces. The mix is good here and if you know what you are looking at, it's easy to figure out. If you don't know what you're looking at, so be it."" -Mitchell Algus    Juliana Cerqueira Leite, Intransitive, installation view, Regina Rex, February 28 - April 10, 2016. Courtesy Regina Rex. Regina Rex 221 Madison Street Opened: August 2014 Artist-run space Regina Rex was founded in Bushwick, Brooklyn, in 2010, and moved to a space down on the southern end of the Lower East Side in 2014. ""Rent here was comparatively affordable and easy to arrange, actually much more so than Brooklyn, which was (and is) under such speculative development that acquiring a space at a rate we could sustain was highly unlikely. This stretch of the Lower East Side feels, in the best way, like much of the neighborhood did ten years ago--filled with bodegas, salons, franchises and small businesses. It's live, vital, and inhabited by large Chinese and Hispanic populations. When we moved, there were already many spaces in the LES with untraditional gallery models like CANADA, Abrons Art Center, Reena Spaulings, Beverly's and others, so it felt like a natural place for us to land, and broaden our audience. Definitely, more restaurants, bars and galleries have moved southward. But compared to areas northward, we are surrounded by a lot more low-income and affordable housing units and co-ops, which hopefully will result in the preservation of the economic and racial diversity that makes the neighborhood typical of the 'garden' of New York. The LES has such a rich cultural history, and that has attracted artists to the neighborhood for years. So it definitely feels more integrated than other art hubs as a place where artists, not only exhibit, but live, work, eat and drink."" -Katherine Aungier and Max Warsh of Regina Rex    Scott Alario, Ecstatic Consumption, installation view, Kristen Lorello, March 17 - May 1, 2016.

Kristen Lorello 195 Chrystie Street, #600A, 6th floor Opened: April 2014 On the 6th floor of a building right behind the New Museum, Kristen Lorello is one of the most diminutive exhibition spaces in Manhattan (about 165 square feet). The lack of space is more than made up for by a robust program of young artists. ""When I decided to open my own gallery, I knew I wanted it to be located within Manhattan. When I began looking for a space, I walked around extensively on the Lower East Side and in Chelsea. Since I knew I would be showing artists who were in the early stages of their New York careers, I felt that the Lower East Side would be the best choice. The rents in the LES were more manageable than in Chelsea and I thought the neighborhood would attract collectors looking to discover artists. I'm very happy in the neighborhood. [Concerning foot traffic], for me, meeting people at art fairs and nurturing relationships with different collectors, curators, and advisors has been the driving factor in selling works. My gallery is turning two this month and people are coming in each day. This was not the case in my first year of business, so it is exciting that foot traffic is gradually continuing to increase. ""I think that in general, the galleries in the LES have a somewhat intimate feel to them as well as a generally friendly vibe. For those who are just beginning to collect, this is a great neighborhood to venture to, as many galleries are showing works in an affordable price range. In turn, the neighborhood also offers seasoned collectors a chance to discover new artists and to support younger galleries who they would like to see succeed."" -Kristen Lorello    On Stellar Rays' new space, 213 Bowery, which will open April 10th with an exhibition by John Houck, Playing and Reality, April 10 - May 22, 2016. Courtesy On Stellar Rays. On Stellar Rays 1 Rivington Street, 213 Bowery Opened: October 2008 On Stellar Rays has long been one of the beacons on the Lower East Side. This month, they expand at their 1 Rivington address, opening a new, ground-floor space in the same building. ""On Stellar Rays opened in October 2008--right on the heels of the financial meltdown. The gallery actually opened one day after Lehman Brothers announced bankruptcy. The timing, while challenging, afforded the gallery the opportunity to take more risks with programming--showcasing video, performance, and sculptural installations--a defining characteristic of the gallery that carries through to today. The LES was the logical neighborhood for the gallery to open because the rents were among the most affordable options at the time. The opening of the New Museum certainly propelled a lot of the movement downtown as well. On Stellar Rays has a dedicated core audience visiting regularly, but we are very excited to expand our reach with an imminent move to the ground floor on April 10. This move to a storefront space on the corner of Rivington and Bowery, steps from the New Museum, provides our artists with a more visible and flexible opportunity to realize their projects. We are doubling our gallery square footage, and as a result, our capacity to provide dialogue and experimentation via talks, screenings, performances, discursive events, and partnerships with other arts organizations. ""The neighborhood is certainly more active all times of the day now, and I see this dynamic only expanding in the months to come. We are in the company of several friends' galleries, just within a few steps down the block. Our friend Andrew Edlin recently moved directly across the street, and we look forward to opening of the International Center of Photography a block north. I feel that the next phase of change will coincide with the opening of hotels around either corner from us. The programming at LES galleries is more experimental and risk-taking, and we do not see that changing anytime soon. Galleries live side-by-side with a dynamic and thriving creative community, and are not as silo-ed off as other art hub areas tend to be."" -Kristen Wawruck, Director   --Natalie Hegert

ENTERTAINMENT,"Jazz musician Bob Dorough, the chief composer of the “Schoolhouse Rock” cartoon series, died Monday at the age of 94. Dorough died of natural causes at his home in Mount Bethel, Pennsylvania, according to The Associated Press. Born in Arkansas, Dorough was able to make a living as a pianist and composer from the time he moved to New York in 1949. Although he worked with greats like Miles Davis in the 1950s and ’60s, it was in the early 1970s with “Schoolhouse Rock” that Dorough made his biggest pop culture impact. In 1971, Dorough was working a day job at a New York advertising company when his boss asked him to set the multiplication tables to music, figuring if kids could remember rock lyrics, it might help them learn math, according to NPR. “I got the idea that three is a magic number,” Dorough told NPR in 2013. “Then I looked in the magic book and sure enough, three is one of the magic numbers.”  Dorough turned that concept into a ditty called “Three Is a Magic Number,” and it became the first step for a project first known as “Multiplication Rock” and, later, “Schoolhouse Rock.” Then-ABC executive Michael Eisner turned the songs into a series of animated videos that appeared between Saturday morning cartoon shows for 12 years. The series was revived for five years in the 1990s. Dorough continued performing, but in the 1990s started noticing adults were requesting the “Schoolhouse Rock” songs at his shows after they recognized his voice. “I am not surprised at all [that the videos still resonate],” Dorough said, according to WNEP-TV. “I learned, when performing at elementary schools, that they were ‘getting through,’ so to speak, and the children would readily recognize my voice on such vocals as ‘Three Is a Magic Number’ and others that I sang.” “However, what surprised me most was the impact of network television, which kicked in years later, after we’d been on air at ABC-TV,” he said. “Thirteen years, plus a second round, helped us to reach literally thousands, in a rather broad age spectrum.”  Dorough remained active all his life. Two weeks ago, he was a “scheduled performer” at the School of Visual and Performing Arts in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, according to the Allentown Morning Call. A funeral is tentatively scheduled for Monday in Mount Bethel. "
ENTERTAINMENT,"Ryan Reynolds opened up recently about living with anxiety, a condition the “Deadpool” star says he’s been dealing with most of his life. “I have anxiety, I’ve always had anxiety,” the 41-year-old actor told The New York Times Thursday. “Both in the lighthearted ‘I’m anxious about this’ kind of thing, and I’ve been to the depths of the darker end of the spectrum, which is not fun.” Despite his cool and confident demeanor, the Times described Reynolds as a nervous wreck who gets “wracked by dread and nausea” before talk show appearances and convinces himself that he “might die.” In fact, when Reynolds worked on ABC’s “Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place,” back in the late ’90s and early 2000s, he said he’d do the audience warm-up to help ease “the energy of just wanting to throw up.” Reynolds’ anxiety extends beyond pre-show jitters, however. He said he grew up in a volatile environment because of his late father, with whom Reynolds had a complicated relationship. As a young boy, Reynolds said he spent much of his time trying to avoid agitating his dad, or “the stress dispensary in our house,” by keeping their home in Vancouver, British Columbia, exceedingly clean. “I became this young skin-covered micro manager,” he said. “When you stress out kids, there’s a weird paradox that happens because they’re suddenly taking on things that aren’t theirs to take on.” Yet, his father also introduced him to comedy greats such as Buster Keaton and Jack Benny, who helped Reynolds develop his trademark sense of humor — that, the actor also admitted, he uses as a self-defense mechanism. For instance, while promoting “Deadpool 2,” Reynolds has found that doing interviews in character has helped him combat stress. He also said that once he actually begins an interview, a lot of his anxiety vanishes. “When the curtain opens, I turn on this knucklehead, and he kind of takes over and goes away again once I walk off set,” he said. “That’s that great self-defense mechanism. I figure if you’re going to jump off a cliff, you might as well fly.”"
ENTERTAINMENT,"“Sesame Street” isn’t all fun and games, if a lawsuit filed Thursday by its parent company, Sesame Workshop, is any indication. The nonprofit educational organization responsible for the beloved children’s TV show is suing STX Productions, the producers of the upcoming film “The Happytime Murders,” for using the “Sesame Street” name in the movie’s marketing, specifically the tagline “No Sesame. All Street.” “Sesame seeks to enjoin Defendants’ deliberate effort to appropriate its SESAME STREET mark, and its trusted brand and goodwill, to promote their R-rated movie, ‘The Happytime Murders,’ by way of a violent and sexually-explicit trailer,” the lawsuit states. “The Happytime Murders” is an R-rated buddy-cop movie set in a world where humans and Sesame Street–style puppets co-exist. Melissa McCarthy stars as a police officer who gets a new puppet partner and is tasked with solving a series of connected murders. It appears the makers of the classic children’s program are continuing their mission of education by teaching STX Productions a valuable lesson in trademark infringement. “The Happytime Murders” hits theaters Aug. 17."
BUSINESS,"What should you leave at home when you go shopping this summer? Jennifer Boaro prefers this strategy: Put your credit cards into a cup of water. Then store it in the freezer. ""That way,"" says Boaro, a furniture designer from Bellevue, Wash., ""I have to wait for the ice to melt before I can use it."" Ah, the things we do to keep us from overshopping. Almost 1 in 10 Americans is a compulsive shopper, and the disorder even has a name: Compulsive Buying (CB). Interestingly, most of the research points to poor planning, not a hedonistic lifestyle, as the reason for overdoing it. So if you're stuck with a five-figure credit card bill, a few adjustments to your shopping experience could do the trick. This is a good time to try some new strategies. With the upcoming Memorial Day sales just ahead, you can't afford to wait. And don't forget the Fourth of July, Labor Day and then -- watch out! -- Black Friday and Christmas. You don't have to become a statistic. Last week in this column, I discussed the items you should take shopping with you. Today, I present a list of things you should leave behind: Another person with CB or young kids with little self-control.
""Any parent will tell that you that trying to do any kind of shopping with young children can feel like a truly impossible task at times,"" says Kerri Moriarty, a veteran shopper and head of company development at the financial website Cinch Financial. But that can be true when you're shopping with friends or a significant other. The best shoppers go solo, says Moriarty. They're focused and determined to find the product they need at the best price. A bad day.
Many CB sufferers turn to retail therapy to make them feel better. Retailers even promote it as a way of easing some of your life's stress. Go shopping; it'll make you feel better! ""However, spending money is unrelated to whatever is bothering you,"" says Kendal Perez, a savings expert with CouponSherpa.com, a coupon website. ""It only provides a short-term high that may result in an even worse day if your problems are spending-related."" Indeed, the right state of mind isn't just desirable for shoppers -- it's required. An unlimited budget.
If you have one of those platinum cards without a spending limit, you should keep it in your freezer. ""Don’t leave home without a limit,"" says April Masini of ""Ask April"" fame, who has seen more than her fair share of relationships wither under the pressure of extreme debt. ""If you’re someone who’s prone to spending -- or overspending -- give yourself a thoughtful limit before you leave home."" If you know you suffer from a touch of CB, talk to the person you may choose to take with you. Set a limit and ask that person to hold you accountable. Note: Did I mention you should leave your kids at home? Your credit card.
Jocelyn Johnson, a mother of two girls from Elkins Park, Pa., can't leave them at home when she goes shopping, so she does the next best thing: she leaves her credit cards. ""Instead, I gave myself a weekly cash allowance, so as I shop, I'm not tempted to grab items just because it's on sale or only $2.99,"" she says. ""This also helps me regulate impulse buying when my girls want to just throw items in the cart."" I've used the ""oops-I-left-my-credit-card-at-home"" excuse myself, but it only works for a while with kids. Sooner or later, they'll ask you if you remembered your card before you leave. And then, as they say, the jig is up. If you suffer from CB or know someone who does, these strategies might help. But as before, the only way to stay safe is to keep away from the mall, the big box retail store, or the computer. And helping you do that is beyond the scope of this column.

ARTS & CULTURE," The battle between Actors Equity and its members in Los Angeles has dragged on for over a year, despite behind-the-scenes negotiations to avoid a threatened lawsuit.  And now ill-considered statements by AEA President Kate Shindle, along with upcoming union elections, have thrust the battle back into the public light. To give a bit of background on this long-running dispute, forty years of blossoming creativity was put in jeopardy when Actors Equity launched a proposal that would essentially gut the small theater scene in Los Angeles.  The proposal would prohibit Equity members -- who are often the producers, fundraisers, set painters and generally all-around volunteer laborers in the small theaters -- from working for less than a wage determined by the union.  But who is supposed to pay that wage -- which would quickly bust the budget -- when it is the actors themselves who are supporting the company?  Despite an overwhelming vote by the LA membership opposing the proposal, Actors Equity insisted on forcing the plan on its members, which led to the threatened lawsuit and a protracted period of negotiations, which apparently have achieved very little in terms of tangible results, particularly in terms of the approach of Equity officials. However, the Los Angeles actors appear to have gained the upper hand,  especially if President Shindle's remarks are any indication.  As in any negotiation, there is both an inside and an outside game, and Equity seems to be clueless as to the outside game, as their own president's talking points illustrate.  Here's an example of Shindle's statements in the interview, referring to the decision by the union's Council to launch the proposal:  ""...one of the things that guided the Council - the idea that a mid-sized theater....could open at this point in Los Angeles when they had to compete with the 99-seat business model (which is much more cost-effective) is kind of preposterous."" This is a pretty weak argument on several counts.  Perhaps most tenuous is the idea that a union's governing body should be guided by promoting a particular ""business model.""  The role of a labor union - first and last - is to represent the interests of its members.  It is certainly not supposed to be advocating for a particular set of business interests over its own members.  In addition, the idea of a ""business model"" in the theater world is also suspect.  Outside of Broadway and the touring business (where, incidentally, Equity been accused of serious laxity), the ""business model"" for American theater rests on three legs - subscription audiences, government subsidies and philanthropy.   Subscription audiences, which are dwindling, are available primarily for existing theaters in affluent urban areas, while government subsidies are determined as much by political considerations as artistic merit.  And philanthropy - also diminishing - is dependent on the whims of the top 1%.  Not exactly a viable business model. What all of this reveals - despite a years-long struggle to alter their consciousness - is that the leadership of Actors Equity is mired in the past.  American theater, led by the vitality and creativity of artists like those in Los Angeles, has become a burgeoning and bustling counterpoint to the domination of mass culture.  Furthermore, artists are striking out on their own - moving past the old paradigm of labor-management strife into a more promising future of creative entrepreneurship.  Old-time labor unions like Equity have to change their thinking if they want to not only survive, but have a positive voice in the future."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Chrissy Teigen was following the royal baby news closely on Monday morning when she noticed something “weird” ― that Kensington Palace had tweeted out that the Duchess of Cambridge was in labor at a London hospital. Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge was admitted to St. Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, London earlier this morning in the early stages of labour. The Duchess travelled by car from Kensington Palace to the Lindo Wing at St. Mary’s Hospital with The Duke of Cambridge. Once the palace tweeted the news, news outlets quickly picked it up and prepared for the arrival of her third royal baby with the Duke of Cambridge.  Teigen, of course, perfectly encapsulated just how odd it was that the whole world was on “vagina watch,” as she called it.  “Guys. It is time. For. VAGINA WATCH, 2018 (how WEIRD would this be???)” she wrote.  Kensington Palace made the same announcements for the former Kate Middleton’s previous two pregnancies ― tweeting out when she was in labor and again when she’d given birth to Prince George and Princess Charlotte.  Here is the tweet from George’s birth in 2013:  Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge has been admitted to St. Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, London in the early stages of labour. And the one for Charlotte’s birth in 2015: HRH The Duchess of Cambridge was admitted at 06.00hrs to St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, London and is in the early stages of labour. The third royal baby was born Monday morning and weighed 8 pounds, 7 ounces. According to the Palace, “Her Royal Highness and her child are both doing well.”  Teigen is on her own “baby watch,” as the supermodel and her husband, John Legend, are expecting their second child, who will also be a boy. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Have you ever gone hunting for gold? Brooklyn-based artist Iván Sikic’s new installation, ""LOOT"" (""SAQUEO"" in Spanish), revives that childhood dream of uncovering priceless ore. But he adds a harsh political edge, framing it in a history of colonial oppression, miner exploitation, and good ol' human greed. To do so, Sikic buried a 24-karat gold nugget beneath 54 tons of dirt in an abandoned mansion in Peru’s capital city, Lima. Then, he asked people to engage in the artwork by, well, digging. Whoever found the hidden nugget would be able to keep it -- which is no small success, as it’s worth around $2,000.   “LOOT tackles an issue that is the result of human behavior,” Sikic wrote to The Huffington Post, “and I felt it was important to put the viewer at the center of the work (by inviting them to participate in the creation of it) in order to best expose the repercussions of humanity’s actions.” The artwork thrusts the normally passive art-goer into a morally precarious position: he both relishes the dig and must question that enjoyment. That’s because gold has a long and troubled history in Peru, where Sikic grew up. European settlers ravaged indigenous populations to extract it, and today’s mining practices are similarly destructive -- both to the Amazon Rainforest and to the lives of over 400,000 illegal miners. Those problems, however, are rarely addressed in urban centers like Lima.  “Peru is an extremely centralized country,” Sikic wrote, “where the issues that take place outside the capital (in this case, that of illegal gold mining and its consequences), for the most part, tend to have a soft focus put on them, which only gets sharpened sporadically.” Sharpening that soft focus required a mix of partnership and good fortune. A Peruvian jeweler helped him source the gold and acquire extensive quality certification, but the abandoned mansion was acquired through pure luck. Sikic’s Lima gallery Gonzalez y Gonzalez was located across the street from the derelict. When they inquired, gallery representatives learned it was scheduled for demolition -- and the property developers were happy to give Sikic free artistic reign. The installation was open to hunters for just three days, but when no one was able to uncover the nugget, Sikic himself took on the role of miner to unearth it. While the performance piece may no longer be open for those seeking riches, it continues to address the unacknowledged ways income and lifestyle disparities can emerge from those riches. “I realized that the reading of it went well beyond that of my original intention,” Sikic wrote, “and the work seemed to also speak a lot about human greed for anything that we consider to be of significant value.”        "
BUSINESS,"WASHINGTON, April 7 (Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed sharply in March amid continued layoffs in the retail sector, but a drop in the unemployment rate to a near 10-year low of 4.5 percent suggested the labor market was still tightening. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 98,000 jobs last month, the fewest since last May, Labor Department said on Friday. Job gains, which had exceeded 200,000 in January and February, were also held back by a slowdown in hiring at construction sites, factories and leisure and hospitality businesses, which had been boosted by unusually warm temperatures earlier in the year. In March, temperatures dropped and a storm lashed the Northeast, likely accounting for some of the stepback in hiring. The two-tenths of a percentage point drop in the unemployment rate from 4.7 percent in February took it to its lowest level since May 2007. “There probably was a large weather-related factor in there during the measurement week. If you look at the underlying data outside of this singular report and the way it’s measured, the data still suggests that job growth is pretty good,” said Russell Price, senior economist at Ameriprise Financial Services in Troy, Michigan. The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. U.S. stock index futures were slightly lower. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. While the bigger establishment survey showed fewer jobs created last month, the smaller and more volatile survey of households showed employment increased 472,000. The labor market is expected to hit full employment this year. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing 180,000 last month and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.7 percent. The weak payrolls gain could raise concerns about the economy’s health especially given signs that gross domestic product slowed to around a 1.0 percent annualized growth pace in the first quarter after rising at a 2.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Average hourly earnings increased 5 cents or 0.2 percent in March after rising 0.3 percent in February. That lowered the year-on-year increase in wages to 2.7 percent. Given rising inflation, the moderate job gains and gradual wage increases could still keep the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates again in June. The U.S. central bank lifted its overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in March and has forecast two more hikes this year. The Fed has said it would look at how to reduce its portfolio of bond holdings later this year. “I think for the Fed, it doesn’t change all that much in the near-term outlook. They were not going to go in May, and there are still going to be two more employment reports before the June meeting,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, held at an 11-month high of 63 percent in March. A broad measure of unemployment, that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell to 8.9 percent, the lowest level since December 2007, from 9.2 percent in February. The employment-to-population ratio increased one-tenth of a percentage point to 60.1 percent, the highest since February 2009. Last month, construction jobs increased 6,000, the weakest since August, after robust gains in January and February. Manufacturing employment gained 11,000 jobs, slowing from the 26,000 positions created in February. Retail payrolls fell 29,700, declining for a second straight month. Retailers including J.C. Penney Co Inc and Macy’s Inc have announced thousands of layoffs as they shift toward online sales and scale back on brick-and-mortar operations. Government payrolls increased 9,000 despite a freeze on the hiring of civilian workers.   (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Additional reporting by Herb Lash and Sam Forgione in New York; Editing by Andrea Ricci)"
ARTS & CULTURE,"""There are many ways of traveling. With the body. With the mind. Moving physically or not moving at all. You can move around thousands of kilometers without traveling, or move the body while the mind is stuck in the starting point."" Such is the reality of movement, according to Argentina-based photographer Federico Winer. His series, ""Ultradistancia,"" channels this whimsical understanding of travel into a stunning art project, turning the world into a petri dish of colors and shapes that requires no migration at all. In fact, his series is based on the capabilities of Google Earth's satellite camera, a seemingly omnipresent technology that allows Winer -- a veteran traveler in his own right -- to scour the planet's landscapes without ever leaving the comfort of his glowing computer screen.   To create his geometrically mesmerizing snapshots, he plays around on the internet quite a bit -- or, in his words, takes long Google Earth trips. He hovers over neighborhoods and landmarks, busy routes and tranquil fields, in order to find something that piques his interest. He experiments with different magnitudes, reframing and recomposing his portrait subjects. Then he begins manipulating the images, playing with color and luminosity until a beautifully distorted photo emerges.   It's easy to fall inside one of Winer's kaleidoscopes, that combine the chaos of super highways with the eerie abandon of farmlands or cargo shipments. Winer emphasizes the patterns that happen organically across the globe, infusing each aerial view with saturated pigments and selective perspectives. ""Common landmarks resembles paintings and topography explodes in rare colors,"" he explains. ""We've known for a long time that what we see is not what it is,"" he continued in an email exchange with HuffPost. Winer is also a professor of political philosophy at the University of Buenos Aires, and his descriptions of ""Ultradistancia"" often wander into musings. ""Basically, because we don’t know what is what it is, we only know what we see. And we call that ‘the world.'"" The quotes in this article has been edited for clarity."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Warning: This post contains nudity and may not be appropriate for work.    La Savona, Indianapolis Indiana 2012  It takes a brave spirit -- of any age -- to pose for the camera donning nothing but feathers, rhinestones and sparkly heels. To do so post-retirement, however, requires a certain combination of confidence, liberation, fire and sensuality we can only imagine.  In her series ""Legends,"" photographer Marie Baronnet photographs the former legends of American burlesque in all their scantily clad glory. Though aspects of the burlesque performers' attitudes as well as parts of their physical appearance have changed over time, the undeniable spark of eroticism remains, seducing the viewer with a strangely magnetic grip.  Baronnet was inspired to embark on the series after meeting and then interviewing and photographing burlesque icon Dixie Evans. The photo shoot compelled Baronnet to expand the project and seek out other former burlesque luminaries around the country. ""I was driven by the desire to work again on women’s representation, with older women, usually not shown with full charge of audacity and femininity,"" Baronnet explained to The Huffington Post. ""Also, I was discovering and investigating their stories just as an ethnologist on individuals of a rare tribe.""
 Bambi Jones, Henderson Nevada 2012  The word burlesque, derived from Italian burlesco or burla, which means joke or ridicule, can refer to both dramatic and literary parodies caricaturing more serious works. In America, the term has come to refer to a particular variety show format, often incorporating elements of bawdy comedy and striptease. But the tradition has always been about far more than disrobing.  ""American burlesque is an authentic art form,"" explained Baronnet. ""It is as modern and contemporary as it is political, an intelligent mix of popular tradition and social avant-garde. It's a strong community where all genders are mixed and celebrated."" Likewise, the women of American burlesque are just as authentic. ""These women were pioneers, using their art to conquer for themselves and for other minorities their independence. They were natural activists of the feminist cause, consciously for some, not so much for others. But they all were 'free spirits' at heart, and so bold for their time,"" she continued. ""For those women, burlesque is an imaginary world of its own, which in my mind makes it a genuine artistic domain of expression, just like painting or cinema. They invented modern 'performance' on stage in direct interaction with their lively audience, plugging into human soul and flesh, dancing with elegance and suggestion, wearing (or 'un-wearing') haute couture costumes, improvising choreographies on live music. Glamour and imagination were thrown at the spectators.""
 Stephanie Blake, Simi Valley 2013  Baronnet used her investigative skills to track down potential subjects, finding help in the accommodating burlesque community along the way. The photographer collaborated with each of her models on a concept for their image, plotting out a particular attitude, setting and costume for each. ""Again, these women are creative ​and audacious; they are performers by nature, ​so they were not afraid of my photographic propositions. With each one, the shoot was an adventure that took us beyond the usual 'pin-up' cliché.""

The images range from playful to contemplative, with some subjects appearing completely unclothed while others don bedazzled bikinis, garter belts and corsets. Partly nostalgic and partly of the moment, the works capture the multiple shades of past and present that make up a human being.  ""They ​see themselves as they are today, and as they are yesterday,"" said Baronnet. ""​I​ never tried to make them look much younger; it was part of the deal and they agreed to it, not afraid of reality. It's a photographic moment where the past meets the present, reflecting on​ each other, where I state that it's important that older women can be shown, as beau​tiful, spiritual, inspiring.""  In the end, ""Legends"" chronicles a particular breed of American heroine, while giving us all something to look forward to in our later years. In the words of Baronnet: ""There is no age to be a woman and to be alive, and that's eroticism.""

POLITICS,"A Republican running for Congress in Arizona compared abortion to the Holocaust this week ― a trope that has a long history in the pro-life movement. Wendy Rogers, a retired Air Force pilot seeking the GOP nomination in the state’s 1st congressional district, made the comparison during a campaign event in Maricopa, Arizona, on Monday after she was asked about restricting federal funding to Planned Parenthood. “The callousness that our country has for life is very disturbing,” Rogers said, according to audio captured by a tracker for Democratic opposition research firm American Bridge. “I have visited Auschwitz twice — maybe three times; three times. I have visited the killing fields in Cambodia. This is what happens to a country when the callousness for life erodes to that depth.” She further called Planned Parenthood a “despicable organization,” and criticized “crooks” in Washington for failing to defund it. “As someone who is 100% pro-life, I think what the Democratic Party has done to promote a Culture of Death is very much like the Holocaust - Planned Parenthood and other abortion doctors have killed millions of babies this decade alone - barbaric!” Rogers told HuffPost in response to a request for comment. Rogers is one of four GOP candidates vying to challenge incumbent Rep. Tom O’Halleran (D-Ariz.) in November. This is her fourth run for Congress, falling short in the primary each time. The National Republican Campaign Committee this year added her to their ‘Young Guns’ program.  Comparing abortion to the Holocaust is commonplace within the pro-life movement. Conservatives have similarly warned that other hot-button issues, like gay marriage or gun control, could lead the U.S. down the road of Nazi Germany. This has been updated to include a comment from Rogers."
BUSINESS,"Is it possible for a company to be too good? Can a business outperform its competitors, spoil its customers, dominate the competition so much that it harms an entire industry -- including, ultimately, its own customers? Maybe. But there's a way you can benefit from it. Take Tesla, for example. ""Their service is absolutely incredible,"" says Dan Nainan, a comedian from New York. ""Everything from their phone support, to their willingness to come pick up the car if there's a problem, to their service centers, which look more like luxuriously appointed offices with food, flat-panel TV, and Wi-Fi, rather than some grubby waiting room."" The other car manufacturers are a joke, he says. They don't stand behind their products, their service centers are rundown and unwelcoming, and the overall service levels are disappointing. Sure, their products often cost half the price of a Tesla, but that doesn't seem to bother Nainan and the 186,000 other Tesla owners. And with the company now offering a new $35,000 model this year, many more motorists may start to see things Nainan's way. A company like Tesla makes many other car manufacturers look incompetent, but it's not alone. In the airline industry, there's Southwest Airlines and Singapore Air. The hotel industry has Ritz-Carlton. In computers, it's Apple, and in fast food, it's Chick-fil-A. I know what you're thinking. Is there a list? Sure. The American Customer Service Index (ACSI) benchmarks all of its indexed companies by score. Here are the top performers for 2016. 1. Lincoln (Ford) (87)
2. Chick-fil-A (87)
3. Dole (86)
4. Dr Pepper Snapple (86)
5. Honda (86)
6. Dial (85)
7. BMW (85)
8 Toyota (85)
9. LG (85)
10. Bosch (85) Note: The ACSI doesn't cover every company, so Tesla isn't on the list. Ritz-Carlton is part of Marriott. But you get the idea. Another great source is Fortune's ""most admired"" list: 1. Apple
2. Amazon
3. Starbucks
4. Berkshire Hathaway
5. Disney
6. Alphabet (Google)
7. General Electric
8. Southwest Airlines
9. Facebook
10. Microsoft Quality sells. Some, but not all, of these companies have customers service built into their DNA. ""It's inseparable from the company itself,"" says Benjamin Glaser, an editor for DealNews, a bargain website. ""Who could think of Amazon without a speedy credit for a late package, or Apple without helpful Apple Store Geniuses, or Starbucks without consistent baristas no matter what store you walk into? Certainly, a lesson here is that customers stick with dependable, pleasant experiences."" In other words, go for quality. That's always helpful advice. What good is a low price if you're getting a shoddy product or service? But there's a more interesting question, which is: Can one really good company make an entire industry look bad, thanks to its awesomeness? Can it over-serve its customers -- even spoil them? Let's take a reality check for a moment. Companies are like people; they are not perfect. Eventually, even the top performers will disappoint you. Also, remember that you don't always have a meaningful choice. In some industries (notably subscription TV services, internet search engines and social media) there's almost no competition, which is to say the businesses are de facto monopolies. There, being great doesn't really matter because who else are you going to do business with? But there are the Teslas, Starbucks and Apples of the world that arguably have competition and still shine. What's their effect on the rest of their industry? For rivals, it must be demoralizing to see the same competitor recognized year after year for being a favored business by consumers, if not also by Wall Street. Tesla's stock price must drive the other car manufacturers mad, for example. But for consumers, doing business with one of these overachievers also has its downside. Because you can quickly get spoiled. I like my Café Americano done with no room for cream and two cubes of ice to cool it down. And you know those Starbucks baristas get it right, whether they're in Dallas or Dubai. I like that. But at any other coffee shops, you just can't be sure. I know people who refuse to try new coffee shops because they love Starbucks' quality and consistency. Yes, it's possible to be too good. That's a bad thing, because it creates a barrier to entry that's difficult to break through and frankly, it makes the rest not try as hard to compete. In the airline industry, for example, even JetBlue seems to have stopped trying to compete with Southwest on service; the other legacy carriers quit a long time ago. Only the luxury car manufacturers come close to Tesla in the service department. It's as if the others don't care. Perhaps our standards need to be more flexible. For example, I might find a better Americano at a no-name corner cafe. Why not give them a chance? There may also be better computer than my old Apple MacBook, a more reliable car than my Honda Pilot. If I remain blindly brand-loyal, am I just making things worse? Customers should not have to play these games, of course. All companies should deliver acceptable service. But until they do, you'll have to shop more strategically, and set your expectations more realistically."
ARTS & CULTURE,"A is for anxiety, which itself comes in many shapes and colors. B is for bipolar disorder, a term still ignorantly used to describe mood swings or temper tantrums. C is for Cotard delusion, a term for a condition that leads an individual to believe he or she is already dead or does not exist.  These are the ABCs of mental illness, thoughtfully compiled and illustrated by India-based writer, illustrator and graphic designer Sonaksha Iyengar.  Iyengar began the series as part of 36 Days of Type, a project challenging designers and illustrators to create their own takes on the letters and numbers of the alphabet, all of which respond to a singular theme. Iyengar, who has struggled with her mental health in the past, decided to focus her alphabet-based works around the still-stigmatized subject.

The images, depicting states ranging from jealousy to insomnia, reveal how mental health struggles touch all lives, and are not always tethered to a diagnosed condition. Iyengar has taken some liberties with the disorders and behaviors she’s chosen to illustrate ― for example, Cotard delusion, or Cotard’s syndrome, is not recognized in the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-V and only extreme jealousy might be considered a mental illness ― but the underlying message remains steady: She aims to spotlight illnesses and symptoms that are often overlooked or under-recognized. Iyengar hopes her imagery, rendered in dreamy pastels seemingly plucked straight from the subconscious, encourage open and generous discussions on the subject matter. “‘Get over it’ is not how it works,” the artist told BuzzFeed, “and I think being more aware and acknowledging mental health will help us make a start in the direction towards kindness and empathy.” “It is time to have honest conversations with each other about the importance of mental health,” she concluded.

First, it's wrong to make a generalized assumption. Second, a personality disorder like Histrionic Personality Disorder often goes undetected because the person can have great social skills. People with HPD tend to love being the center of attention, and sometimes this leads to failure and disappointment. However, like any other mental health issue, the treatment is not to yell or curse, but to give them time and guide them to seek help. But, it's also important to remember that anyone who enjoys attention doesn't have HPD. Always go to a trained medical professional for diagnosis.

So no, it's not about 'being cool'. #atozofmentalhealth - - - - - #365daysofart #drawingaday #36daysoftype @36daysoftype #36days_I #36daysoftype04 #mentalhealth #art #typography #lettering #insomnia #sleepdisorder #sleepless #night #watercolor #igart #sketchbook #digitalart #illustration #selflove #care #mentalhealthawareness #endthestigma A post shared by Sonaksha Iyengar (@sonaksha) on Mar 1, 2017 at 7:49am PST  Jealousy is a complex emotion, but a very human one. While it is often confused for envy, the two are really different. Jealousy often seeps into the head when there's a threat to a relationship - romantic, platonic and familial among others. Envy is about desiring what the other has. While it is normal to feel jealous, it's important to discuss it and find ways to deal with it rather than allow it to collect and erupt in pathological or delusional ways. Talk about it, with someone you trust whether it's a friend or a therapist.  #atozofmentalhealth - - - - - #365daysofart #drawingaday #36daysoftype @36daysoftype #36days_J #36daysoftype04 #mentalhealth #art #typography #lettering #jealous #anger #frustration #watercolor #igart #sketchbook #digitalart #illustration #selflove #care #mentalhealthawareness #endthestigma #love #relationships #brain A post shared by Sonaksha Iyengar (@sonaksha) on Mar 2, 2017 at 8:34am PST  It's easy to say you have kleptomania and justify thievery but that's not true. Kleptomania is the inability to refrain from stealing, and mostly does not involve prior planning. In fact people with kleptomania tend to drown in guilt after they've stolen but are unable to resist the temptation to relieve their emotional disturbance. The objects are usually things they don't even require or can afford.  #atozofmentalhealth - - - - - #365daysofart #drawingaday #36daysoftype @36daysoftype #36days_K #36daysoftype04 #mentalhealth #art #typography #lettering #kleptomania #patterns #watercolor #igart #sketchbook #digitalart #illustration #selflove #care #mentalhealthawareness #endthestigma #brain A post shared by Sonaksha Iyengar (@sonaksha) on Mar 3, 2017 at 8:14am PST  A gap in the record, lacunar amnesia is the loss of memory about one specific event.

Significant fluctuations in a person’s mood with greater intensity and for longer periods end up causing disruptions in daily activities. Please don’t ask anyone with a mood disorder to ‘get over it’. It doesn’t work that way. #atozofmentalhealth - - - - - #365daysofart #drawingaday #36daysoftype @36daysoftype #36days_M #36daysoftype04 #mentalhealth #art #typography #lettering #amnesia #mood #disorder #depression #mania #mdd #bipolardisorder #watercolor #igart #sketchbook #digitalart #illustration #selflove #care #mentalhealthawareness #endthestigma #brain A post shared by Sonaksha Iyengar (@sonaksha) on Mar 5, 2017 at 7:44am PST  People with Narcolepsy struggle with excessive daytime sleepiness and tend to have disturbed sleep even when they do.

ENTERTAINMENT,"Jenna Fischer is giving fans of “The Office” exactly what they want.  The actress, who played Pam Halpert (née Beesly) on the show, finally revealed during an Instagram live chat with fans what she said to Steve Carell (Michael Scott) during his goodbye episode.  In the Season 7 episode ― appropriately titled “Goodbye, Michael” ― Michael decides to leave Scranton, Pennsylvania, a day earlier than expected to join his fiancée, Holly, in Colorado. He says goodbye to everyone in the Dunder Mifflin branch office, though they still believe Michael is coming back to officially say goodbye the next day.   Pam, who is running errands at the time (which includes going to a movie), nearly misses her chance to say goodbye to her former boss. Luckily, her husband ― Jim Halpert (played by John Krasinski) ― figures out that Michael isn’t coming back and tells Pam to meet Michael at the airport.  When Pam finally reaches Michael, he’s just taken off his mic and tearily said goodbye to the documentary crew before going through airport security. Pam also doesn’t have a mic on as she rushes through security to tell her boss goodbye and give him a hug. Which is why, when the two embrace and say their goodbyes in the show, the audience doesn’t know what they actually tell each other ― until now.   “That was me talking to Steve. I told him all the ways I was going to miss him when he left our show,” Fischer said during the Instagram chat, adding that she was speaking as both herself and as Pam, according to Entertainment Weekly. “Those were real tears and a real goodbye. That was a really emotional scene.”  Somehow, that makes the sweet scene even more special than it was before.  Though nostalgic fans are always pining for a reunion, nothing is currently in the works ― but Fischer is totally on board to play Pam again.  “I loved playing the character, and as long as Greg Daniels is the person in charge and the visionary behind it, then I’m absolutely [in],” she said, according to The Wrap. “We’d just have to get Mindy [Kaling] to write some episodes, B.J. Novak ... that show was so great because of the talent involved in the show, behind the scenes, not just [on screen].” Krasinski recently thought of a great way to bring the cast together again if a full-season revival doesn’t happen.  “I think the U.K. thing that I always have pitched and wanted to do is that Christmas special thing, where we do a Christmas special this year and then two years from now, or three years from now, we do another one,” he told IndieWire. “I love that idea coming back finding out where everybody is. I would totally be down for that.”"
ENTERTAINMENT,"Nyle DiMarco, a model and deaf activist, is shedding a little light on a big problem with inclusion. And he used the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a jumping off point. In April, the website Mic published an article about how MCU has a diversity problem. The article discusses at length how Marvel tends to put white men at the forefront of its stories. But like many other articles and conversations about diversity, it neglects to mention people with disabilities. So when the story popped up in DiMarco’s feed, the extremely vocal disability advocate wasn’t going to let that significant detail slide. “Disability is also a part of diversity, @mic,” DiMarco, the winner of Cycle 22 of “America’s Next Top Model” and Season 22 of “Dancing With the Stars,” wrote on Twitter. “HawkEye is actually Deaf and MARVEL Cinematic Universe made the character hearing.” Disability is also a part of diversity, @mic.HawkEye is actually Deaf and MARVEL Cinematic Universe made the character hearing.  https://t.co/xjNmv2vmMu Mic ’fessed up to its oversight and invited DiMarco to join in a lengthy and candid conversation on Tuesday about disability. “So many times people forget the disability conversation in diversity,” DiMarco told Mic. “They think diversity has to do with race [and] gender, but there’s so much more to it. We are part of diversity as people with disabilities and the danger is that we get excluded.” During the conversation, DiMarco said Hollywood has made some small strides in disability representation, but added that the film industry has quite a way to go and used the Avengers film franchise again as an example. “There are a couple of issues where specifically Hawkeye is deaf,” DiMarco said, referring to the comic books. “And so they brought in an actor who can hear instead. I think it would have made [better movies]… if they brought a deaf person in to play a deaf Hawkeye.” “I mean, no offense, but Hawkeye in the Avengers is boring. A lot of people don’t even like him… Let’s have a deaf actor in there instead, why not?” To watch DiMarco’s entire interview, which also touches on many other interesting subjects such as his sexuality and growing up in a loving community, check out the video above."

ARTS & CULTURE,"Syzygy is the name of a two-man show opening on April 4th, north of New York City, in Lakeville, Connecticut. It is an alignment of two aesthetic visions. Those of Richard T Scott and those of  myself, Brandon Kralik. Although we write extensively, we are both, first and foremost, painters. For years Richard and I have been working to much the same aim, to tell our individual stories in such a way that they resonate with a larger audience and to convey them using the classical techniques of oil paint.
When the Man Comes Around by Richard T Scott
Murmuration by Brandon Kralik In many ways to have a show of our work together was inevitable. Both Richard and I spent several years painting in the studios of Odd Nerdrum, myself in Norway and Richard in Paris. It was in Paris that we met 4 years ago and we have been collaborating in one way or another ever since. Both of our work can be found in the recently published coffee table book, The Nerdrum School as well as other publications. Syzygy  is a summation of our work up until this point, which, for all of us is a critical point, for we as human beings are entering uncharted waters.
Atlas by Richard T Scott Last spring at TRAC2014 in Ventura, California, where we both gave presentations, there was a definite forward thinking momentum within the representational painting community. There were hundreds of philosophers, educators, writers and painters who came together to discuss what organizer Michel Pearce called a shift in the cultural ocean liner and the realignment of our aesthetic values. Things have changed since the Post Modern philosophy took hold on the Art world and we share the hope that we can work together with other groups of painters to achieve effective and constructive results in this still young millennium. We hope to help deliver classically crafted paintings to a broader audience, a viewing public who not only has an interest in, a craving for what is happening here but is actually in need of what we have to offer.
Impermanence of Time by Richard T Scott
Kat by Richard T Scott Richard T Scott and myself have noted that many of the cultural shifts, or peaks, that have occurred throughout history have coincided with changing world views, inventions and the ability for people to access information. The Greek civilization rose from an influx of knowledge and the expanded use of written language, as did the renaissance with the invention of the printing press.  The industrial revolution allowed for global trade and the mass distribution of books and so we had the birth of a new aesthetic structure, Modernism. So now, decades into the information age it is inevitable that a new philosophy should emerge and with it a realignment of our aesthetic values.
Man With a Hard Drive by Brandon Kralik
Transition by Brandon Kralik Syzygy can also mean an alignment of celestial bodies and the visual image of the Earthrise is one that Richard and I discuss with excitement and curiosity. It has only been some 45 years since mankind first saw the Earth from outside our atmosphere and that symbol has become one of unity among the various nationalities, ethnic groups as well as for the environment. It goes to follow that a forward thinking philosophy is developing out of this new perspective and it is our hope that there is a place in it for paintings that are derived from a position of empathy and which speak to humanity in a dignified, symbolic language that is unique to painting. This perspective differs dramatically from the Post Modern aesthetic, which was firmly established before the new world view. Before we saw ourselves as a little blue dot.
Ascension by Richard T Scott The idea behind this exhibition is one of hope, one that combines classical painting techniques of the past and brings them with us into the 21st Century, into what we call a post contemporary paradigm. Painting is very much alive and now, more than ever, it can offer us a reprieve, a contemplative comfort, a place to rest the eye, even to counter the stress in our lives and relax the health threats posed by electromagnetic radiation, which the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences concluded, ""should be regarded as possible carcinogens.""  Whether or not the power of painting includes the ability to heal, it certainly can help balance us in an world leaning dangerously toward imbalance. To be in the company of well crafted oil paintings is indeed a comfort.  If you live with original oil paintings then you probably know what we are talking about. Richard and I have both heard this from collectors and viewers of our work for years. It is our aim to continue to work toward the masterpiece, to add benefits to individuals and to our society as a whole with our work and this exhibition, Syzygy, is right on target.
Sisyphus' Success by Brandon Kralik Richard T. Scott  earned his BFA from the University of Georgia an MFA from the New York Academy of Art. His painting Baptism won first place in Sattchi online's painting contest, earning him the privilege of having his work presented at the Grand Palais in Paris. His work is in collections around the world including the collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art Sicily and locally his painting What Remains has recently been added to the collection of the New Britain Museum of American Art.
What Remains by Richard T Scott
Young Shaman at the Canyon by Brandon Kralik After a series of epic adventures, poetic jaunts to the far corners of the world, as well as an education in Fine Art at Western State College of Colorado and Hunter College in New York City, I came to Nerdrum's in Norway and afterwards opened my own studio in Sweden ten years ago. During this time my paintings have appeared in group shows in Europe and in the States as well as numerous solo shows including four in Stockholm. My work is in the collection of the Royal Family of Sweden, the Governor's Office of Jönköping and Steven Tyler, among others. Syzygy is my first major show in the United States. Syzygy opens Saturday April 4th, in Lakeville, Connecticut with beverages and snacks served from 4pm until 7pm.  The show will be up until May 3rd. Contact the Tremaine Gallery at Hotchkiss for opening hours, directions and purchasing information."
POLITICS,"Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee reportedly plan to release details about 3,000 Facebook ads linked to the Russian campaign to influence the last presidential election. According to The Wall Street Journal, the files could be released as early as this week and may show images of the promoted material, which demographic groups were targeted and how many people saw them. “We have been in ongoing discussions with Facebook and hope to have the final redacted ads in our possession within a matter of days,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, stated. “As soon as we receive them, it is our intention to share them with the public.” In September, Facebook announced that it had been paid $100,000 to promote thousands of ads that were linked to the Russian-backed Internet Research Agency. Many focused on divisive political or social issues and were designed to sow division in the lead up to the 2016 election. Lawmakers released redacted copies of some of the advertisements last year that focused on immigration, same-sex marriage and gun control. Facebook later said more than 126 million people potentially saw the ads purchased by the Russians.  Schiff’s efforts come just a weeks after Republicans on the Intelligence Committee released a 250-page report that said they had uncovered no evidence of collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump’s election campaign. Democrats dissented, arguing that the investigation was not fully completed, just abandoned. Schiff said the termination amounted to “a great service to the president and a profound disservice to the country.” Lawyers from Facebook, Google and Twitter testified before Congress last October and November amid growing public outrage over the revelations; however, they initially frustrated lawmakers with their limited promises to improve monitoring of such content. Facebook’s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg testified in front of Congress last month following the separate Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved the mishandling of user data. He had previously expressed broad support for government regulation of the network: “The question isn’t, ‘Should there be regulation or shouldn’t there be?’ It’s ’How do you do it?”"
ARTS & CULTURE,"On 28 June 2016, we've spent a day at Lake Iseo in Italy to walk on Christo and Jeanne-Claude's large-scale art installation The Floating Piers. The Floating Piers was first conceived by Christo and Jeanne-Claude together in 1970. It is Christo's first large-scale project since Christo and Jeanne-Claude realized The Gates in 2005, and since Jeanne-Claude passed away in 2009. This video provides you with impressions of The Floating Piers gathered by walking on the piers, viewing it from the surrounding mountains, and hovering over it by helicopter. The Floating Piers is a 3-kilometer-long walkway that extends across the water of Lake Iseo. The piers are 16 meters wide and approximately 35 centimeters high with sloping sides. The fabric continues along 2.5 kilometers of pedestrian streets in Sulzano and Peschiera Maraglio. ""Those who experience The Floating Piers will feel like they are walking on water - or perhaps the back of a whale,"" said Christo. ""The light and water will transform the bright yellow fabric to shades of red and gold throughout the sixteen days."" Christo and Jeanne-Claude's art project lasted sixteen days, June 18 through July 3, 2016. The Floating Piers are 100,000 square meters of shimmering yellow fabric, carried by a modular floating dock system of 220,000 high-density polyethylene cubes, which undulate with the movement of the waves. Visitors could experience the work of art by walking on it from Sulzano to Monte Isola and to the island of San Paolo, which was framed by The Floating Piers.

BUSINESS,"Facebook plans to expand its community operations team by adding 3,000 people as part of a growing effort to screen and combat harmful content on the social network. CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the announcement on his Facebook page Wednesday, pledging that the new hires will help the company “get better at removing things we don’t allow on Facebook like hate speech and child exploitation.” Zuckerberg also said the company will simplify the process for users flagging questionable content for review, and will make it easier for employees to contact law enforcement when necessary. The additional 3,000 screeners represent a near doubling of the company’s community operations team, currently 4,500 strong. Moderators have struggled to stamp out horrific videos before they go viral in real time. Last month, a 20-year-old man in Thailand killed his infant daughter and streamed the death on Facebook Live. Days before that, a 37-year-old man in Cleveland uploaded a video of him shooting and killing another man on Easter Sunday. That video was live on Facebook for around two hours before moderators took it down.

BUSINESS,"Charles Lazarus, the 94-year-old founder of Toys R Us, died Thursday, about a week after the company announced it would file liquidation papers and likely close all of its U.S. operations. Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy in September. In a tweet, the company announced Lazarus’ death, saying there had been “many sad moments” recently but none more upsetting than the death of its founder. There have been many sad moments for Toys""R""Us in recent weeks, and none more heartbreaking than today's news about the passing of our beloved founder, Charles Lazarus. Our thoughts and prayers are with Charles' family and loved ones. Lazarus founded Toys R Us in June 1957, nine years after he opened his first baby furniture and toy store in Washington, D.C., called Children’s Bargain Town. After nearly a decade running Children’s Bargain Town, Lazarus restructured his business, decided to focus solely on toys and reformatted the store to take after a supermarket, so customers could see open shelves of toys and place desired items in shopping carts. In the ’80s, Toys R Us went international, opening locations all over the world. During the company’s closing announcement last week, administrators for the retailer said it planned to close all 75 stores in the U.K. The widespread shutdowns will affect roughly 3,000 employees in the U.K., and about 31,000 in the U.S. There are 791 remaining Toys R Us locations in America. The company had about $5 billion in long-term debt when it filed for bankruptcy in September. When Toys R Us first entered Chapter 11, it had an ambitious plan to restructure and reemerge a healthy business. But after a weak holiday season performance coupled with intense competition from rivals including Amazon, Target and Walmart seemed to do the company in, according to USA Today. Lazarus had no stake in Toys R Us at the time of his death, CNN reported, but the toy industry titan served as CEO of the business until 1994.  In a statement to HuffPost, a Toys R Us spokesperson reiterated the sadness the company felt after Lazarus’ death, adding, “He visited us in New Jersey just last year and we will forever be grateful for his positive energy, passion for the customer and love for children everywhere.”"

POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― Hours after President Donald Trump’s CIA director nominee Gina Haspel refused to condemn torture during her confirmation hearing, a Republican Senate candidate in Wisconsin blasted Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) for her silence about the nomination amid widespread Democratic skepticism toward Haspel. Baldwin has not yet taken a public position because she has not had the chance to meet with the nominee, her office told HuffPost Wednesday evening. Haspel canceled a scheduled meeting and they are attempting to reschedule it. Wisconsin state Sen. Leah Vukmir (R) argued that Baldwin would be backing terrorism if she opposed Trump’s controversial nominee.  “After Sen. Baldwin’s outrageous support of the Iran deal, it’s no surprise that she would rather give the man behind the 9/11 attacks and other terrorists hugs and safe spaces than take adequate action to protect America and confirm Gina Haspel quickly,” Vukmir said in a press release. “This is a dangerous time for America, and our CIA director should be willing to do what it takes to protect our nation, our citizens and our freedoms.” Vukmir’s press release included a bizarre image showing Baldwin with Khalid Sheikh Muhammed, the man accused of planning the Sept. 11 attacks and a torture victim, who asked to submit testimony about Haspel. The image also labeled her as being with “team terrorists.”  Haspel, the Trump nominee, played a role in the Bush administration’s torture and detention program after Sept. 11. She oversaw a CIA black site in Thailand, where agents waterboarded at least two detainees (one before her tenure). She was also involved in destroying videotapes that showed the CIA interrogating its first detainee under the program. Some Democrats and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) have said they will not vote for Haspel, in keeping with the general post-Bush administration consensus on Capitol Hill against using torture. Most Democrats are expected to eventually vote against her. Baldwin is among the senators who hasn’t publicly taken a position. Trump, who has spoken approvingly of waterboarding and other torture tactics, has loudly supported Haspel. The day before her hearing, he tweeted, “Gina Haspel, my highly respected nominee to lead the CIA, is being praised for the fact that she has been, and alway will be, TOUGH ON TERROR!” Subjecting captured terrorist suspects like Muhammed to torture and imprisonment outside the regular U.S. justice system at Guantanamo Bay has prevented the U.S. from successfully convicting them. Most terrorism analysts say the tough tactics actually make counterterrorism work more difficult ― by complicating prosecution, prompting false statements and making U.S. partners abroad less likely to hand suspects over. Baldwin is a top target for Republicans in the 2018 midterms. But the one-term senator is popular in her purple state, which is showing some signs of a Democratic resurgence after Trump eked out a narrow win there in 2016. She released her latest ad, highlighting her work on the opioid crisis, this week. An establishment favorite, Vukmir is one of two high-profile candidates seeking to win the GOP nomination to run against Baldwin in an Aug. 14 primary. Her attack comes before a Republican party convention in Milwaukee planned for this weekend."

Read up and own the cocktail party this weekend!  Here are our favorite stories of the week:  Might your next big sale be one Instagram post away?

Instagram isn't just for candid puppy shots and #foodporn anymore. Big business is going down in this micro-blogging world. Avid art collector and movie star Leo DiCaprio turned to Instagram for the latest addition to his burgeoning art collection. The actor secured this painting by artist Jean-Pierre Roy, titled ""Nachlass (2015),"" after seeing it on the social media image-sharing site.  The piece was on display at PULSE New York Contemporary Art Fair, through Copenhagen's Gallery Poulsen. A representative for Gallery Poulsen said, ""Leonardo spotted it on Instagram and bought it over the phone."" No word on if he double-tapped and hired a Taskrabbit to pick it up.   What is this? A painting for ants?

Well. Yes, actually.  Last year Lorraine Loots, a miniaturist painter from Cape Town, South Africa started a new project. She decided to do one miniaturist painting a day, measuring smaller than 30mm x 30mm.  Her friends teased her, asking what she was going to do with paintings that were so small. She started joking back that they were for ants.  The project quickly grew legs.  She followed up the initial project with a series titled 365 Postcards for Ants, focusing on her native Cape Town, earning immense Instagram fame.   Picasso's electrician forced to give back $100 million 'gift'

Pierre Le Guennec was living the life. An electrician living in the south of France in the early 1970's, he got the once-in-a-lifetime gig of installing burglar alarms - among other things - for one Mr. Pablo Picasso.  Guennec worked for Picasso for three years, until the artist died in 1973, and continued to work for his widow, Jacqueline, until she died 13 years later.  For his years of loyal servitude, Jacqueline allegedly gave him a trunk full of the artist's original works as a gift; a collection of cubist collages, drawings, lithographs, notebooks and a watercolor. Score, right? Not so fast.  Fast forward 40 years, to when Pierre contacted Picasso's son to have the works authenticated. Authenticate they did, but not before they slapped him with a lawsuit alleging they were received illegally. After several years in court, a French judge finally ruled that Le Guennec must return the paintings (valued at $100 million). Ouch!  Following the verdict, Picasso's daughter poured salt about as poetically as words will allow: ""It's a downright cheek to try and make us swallow that story."" Double ouch!  Like what you read?

ARTS & CULTURE,"Carrie Fisher died unexpectedly at the age of 60 on Dec. 27, 2016, but her legacy certainly lives on. The actress proved herself a prolific writer in her lifetime and, according to her publisher Simon & Schuster, her books have seen a massive uptick in sales since her death. President and publisher of Simon & Schuster Publishing Group Jonathan Karp told Entertainment Weekly that the publishing house is “quickly reprinting her books” to meet the overwhelming demand. “All of them have remained in print, but our supply was wiped out by demand. We’ll have more books this week,” Karp told EW.

ARTS & CULTURE,"This summer, a cast entirely comprised of senior actors starred in an adaptation of the 1977 bittersweet romcom “Annie Hall.” “With all due respect to Woody Allen’s creative and comic writing genius,” Shula Chernick, who plays the titular Annie in the film, told HuffPost. “I think our version is much funnier.”  New York-based artists Ellie Sachs and Matt Starr conceived of the project, dreaming up the possibility of creating a movie with an elderly cast on their first date. Starr, who is 28, had already developed a ritual of reenacting classic films with his grandmother Maxine, who has Alzheimer’s. The practice began when Starr realized that, as Maxine got older, their conversations started running in circles, returning again and again to the same simple questions. “I realized we probably weren’t going to have a normal relationship anymore,” Starr confessed.  Yet when Starr and Maxine sat down together to watch “Casablanca,” she began murmuring Ingrid Bergman’s lines from the film under her breath. Starr chimed in as Humphrey Bogart and the two fell into a happy rapport. Starr relayed the experience to Sachs on their date, adding, “I’d love to do this on a larger scale.” She was just the woman to make it happen.  Sachs’ background is in theater. Having worked at prisons, community centers, settlement houses and schools around the country, she was confident they could find a venue to give their idea, of working with seniors to interpret and reenact classic films, a shot.  “We were met with a lot of resistance,” Sachs recalled. “A lot of elderly centers didn’t think their populations could handle it.” Eventually, however, they found a home for their brainchild: Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, located in Manhattan’s Upper East Side.   In March, Sachs and Starr began teaching an Interpretive Cinema class at Lenox Hill. They watched and discussed scenes from films including “Annie Hall,” “Manhattan,” “Casablanca,” “Rear Window,” and “Singin’ in the Rain.” They invited those in the class to vote on which one they’d like to appear in. The class selected “Annie Hall,” which follows the romance between Alvy Singer, an overanxious comedian, and Annie Hall, a breezy and capricious nightclub singer. The more Sachs and Starr mulled over the fragmented framework of the film, the more it seemed to mirror some of the issues their actors grappled with during the aging process. “It’s a memory movie,” Sachs explained. “It tells a story in a nonlinear fashion. It comes down to the question of: What do we remember and why do we remember it? It’s a beautiful comparison to what some of our students might be experiencing.” Many of the actors are dealing, in various ways, with the reality of their minds changing and memories fading. “What could be a more perfect film to work out these issues of memory and talk through them?” Starr said.  Then came casting, a difficult task when working with a class full of outgoing personalities eager for screen time. But the directors agreed that Harry B. Miller, an Emmy-winning set designer who already looks and dresses like Woody Allen, would play Alvy. And Chernick, a self-proclaimed “gypsy,” world traveler and Diane Keaton lookalike, was the perfect Annie.  Initially, Sachs and Starr expected the film to be executed DIY-style, filmed on iPhones with little to no budget. But after seeing the caliber of talent ― and general ebullience ― of the people involved, they decided to think bigger. They’ve now raised almost $7,000 on IndieGogo to help fund the costs of pre- and post-production, including the necessary equipment, location and transportation fees.  Filming had its challenges, but most were logistical rather than personal. “A lot of [the actors] don’t have cell phones,” Starr said. “So we have to call them at 7 in the morning or at 8 at night. Some have email, but are only checking once or twice a day. The communication was difficult.” Another hurdle was the summer heat, brutal for New Yorkers of any age. “Our first day of shooting, we had a 94-year-old in 94-degree heat,” Starr said. “I took it upon myself to have one of those water bottle fans and spray him the entire time.”  Throughout the filming process, Sachs and Starr became best friends with their lead actors. “We go on lots of double dates,” Starr joked. The experience not only strengthened the quality of their collaborative artwork, the directors believe, but illuminated a kind of intergenerational relationship that’s not often experienced.  “I’ve never had friends over 40 years old,” said Starr. “I was only aware of one type of relationship, the one I have with my grandparents.” “You might have one or two older people in your life but you don’t frequently have older people that are friends,” Sachs added. “Because of that, we don’t have access to what it means to be old. Instead we have these pervasive ideas about what it means to be old.” Meeting Miller and Chernick made Sachs and Starr cast their preconceived notions about life post-retirement aside. “Our actors are a lot more active than most of our friends,” Starr said, noting that Miller tap dances, swims and takes Zumba classes regularly.  “I’ve totally decontextualized what it means to age in my head,” Sachs said. “I think it doesn’t have to be such a scary thing. Life can be full of art and love and sex. The people in our class were all dating or had romantic relationships. Just because they’re a certain age, why does that matter? They’re people.” Check out the “My Annie Hall” project on IndieGogo. "
ENTERTAINMENT,"Former “Smallville” cast member and accused sex trafficker Allison Mack was released on Tuesday to the custody of her parents in exchange for $5 million bail. The 35-year-old was charged with sex trafficking on Friday in connection with her alleged involvement with Nxivm (“Nexium”), an alleged cult run by Mack and founder Keith Raniere. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Judge Viktor Pohorelsky of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York, said Mack would be allowed to travel only for court appearances, attorney meetings and other approved reasons.  Mack is prohibited from using cellular services or the internet while she is at her parents’ home, and is forbidden from communicating with former or current members of Nxivm, according to NBC News.  Authorities said Mack recruited women to join what she claimed was a female mentorship group called Jness. She and Raniere are accused of exploiting the women who joined, both sexually and for their labor, according to BuzzFeed. Mack was Raniere’s direct “slave” but acted as “master” to other female members, often forcing them to have sex with Raniere and have his initials branded into their pubic region with a cauterizing pen, according to the criminal complaint obtained by the New York Post.  During the branding, Mack told the women to “feel the pain” and to “think of [their] master,” the criminal complaint said. Mack is accused of cajoling her victims into posing for nude photos for Raniere, which reportedly were also used as blackmail.  If convicted, Mack faces at least 15 years in prison, but People.com says the actress may be working on a plea deal.  Once Mack is released, she is limited to the Central District of California, a jurisdiction that covers parts of Southern California up to the Central Coast, authorities told People.com. Her next court date is May 3. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Warning: This article contains nude imagery that may not be appropriate for work environments.  When you see a woman’s naked body, what assumptions come to mind? Do you see a muse, a victim, a sexual object? This question was on Phoebe Boswell’s mind when she began her multimedia series “For Every Real Word Spoken,” now on view in London. From a distance, the installation resembles a lineup of straightforward, naturalistic pencil drawings of unclothed women, not entirely distinct from the nude images that have adorned gallery and museum walls for centuries. Look closer, however, and you’ll notice that each subject holds a cell phone against her chest, the screen facing outward.  Drawn into each screen is a handmade QR code, which visitors are encouraged to scan with their cell phones, triggering a song, article, image or observation chosen by the real woman featured in the portrait. Scan the drawing above, for example, and Brenda Fassie’s “Good Black Woman” rings out, as if materializing from the heart of the naked figure. The drawings, with their technological details, challenge the idea of the passive female nude. “They’re interactive drawings,” Boswell explained to BBC Africa. “They don’t just exist to please you. They exist to honor themselves.”  In an interview with The Huffington Post, Boswell, who was born in Kenya and raised in the Middle East, expanded upon the motivation for the series. “I wanted to subvert what we have been conditioned to think of when we see the female body naked,” she said. “What we have been taught it means, why we are so cautious about protecting it, why it has this edge of vulnerability the male body doesn’t have.” In part, Boswell was inspired to pursue this topic after coming across a photograph of Ugandan women lying naked on a dirt road. When she first saw it, the image immediately filled her with visceral dread; without thinking, she surmised the women depicted had been the victims of violence.  She later learned that, far from being in danger, the photographic subjects had de-robed as an act of protest. “I thought they were victims and that was turned on its head,” Boswell said, disarmed by how deeply entrenched assumptions regarding women and their bodies are, even in the minds of self-professed feminists.  Through her work, Boswell aims to rupture the associations between female nudity and passivity, weakness and empty allure. “I wanted to celebrate the power of the female body,” she said. “Women are not just sexual objects or victims; we have the power to speak.” For this series, Boswell took inspiration from conceptual artist Adrian Piper’s 1971 series “Food for the Spirit,” in which the artist photographed herself over the course of a month, both with clothes and without, as a ritual of self-love. “She seemed so in control of herself,” Boswell said, describing Piper’s photos as early selfies. “She was insisting, ‘This is how I want you to see me,’ taking complete control over this depiction of herself.” Boswell reached out to potential “For Every Real Word Spoken” subjects on Facebook, inviting women to join her “army” and explore the ways bodies could be used as protest. Her subjects ― a range of writers, artists and activists in her community ― imitate Piper’s blunt and forward pose, staring at the viewer head-on.  In lieu of a camera, however, Boswell’s subjects wield cell phones, the vessels that provide women easy means to portray and disseminate their images, tastes, accomplishments and opinions on their own terms. Incorporating modern tech into the art-viewing experience, Boswell thought, would perfectly summon the proper tension between the image and the person, the digital and the real. “The way we depict ourselves is very much through this space of the digital,” Boswell said. “We have these theoretical, curated versions of ourselves we portray online. And we have our real, vulnerable, fleshy selves that have flaws and suffer. Putting together the very fragile medium of drawing with this digital technology allows the subject to speak directly to the viewer without my input.” Boswell is known for igniting traditional draftsmanship ― or draftswomanship as she calls it ― with the help of virtual technologies like animation, sound and digital manipulation. “I try and layer languages to tell stories,” Boswell said. “I think our identities are so complicated it’s possible to tell our stories in one singular, semantic language. I always use technology in my practice, and am constantly navigating how to do that in ways that honor the draftsmanship, that don’t take over but complement it.” For her exhibition title, Boswell lifted a quote from feminist writer Audre Lorde, which reads: “For every real word spoken, for every attempt I had ever made to speak those truths for which I am still seeking, I had made contact with other women while we examined the words to fit a world in which we all believed, bridging our differences.”  The artist hopes her imagery, like Lorde’s writings, inspire women “to resist the limitations placed on us in society and to speak.” Phoebe Boswell’s “For Every Real Word Spoken” runs until April 22 at Tiwani Contemporary in London. "
ENTERTAINMENT,"Manchester, England, will always be with Ariana Grande. This week marked the anniversary of the deadly bombing attack that occurred during her 2017 Manchester Arena concert. On Thursday, the “No Tears Left To Cry” singer posted an emotional tribute to the victims of the attack, which left 22 people dead, with a photo of a bee tattoo inked just above one of her ears. “Forever,” the 24-year-old wrote in the caption of the photo posted to Twitter and Instagram, alongside an emoji of a dark cloud. forever ☁️ pic.twitter.com/mI61BiF640 The worker bee is a symbol of Manchester and celebrates the city’s industrious spirit. According to the BBC, it’s even incorporated into the city’s coat of arms. In June 2017, PRI reported that many Manchester residents showed their solidarity with the victims and survivors of the devastating bombing by getting the bee tattoo. The Sun also reported in June 2017 that after Grande’s One Love Manchester benefit concert, which raised money for those affected by the tragedy, the singer and her tour team got the bee tattoo backstage. Though this could very well be the tattoo featured in Grande’s post on Tuesday, the Daily Beast reported that when Grande got the bee tattoo backstage after her tribute concert, she got it on her arm, not above her ear — so this could possibly be a new tattoo.  Yet regardless of how many worker bee tattoos the singer may have, Grande still feels the sting of the attack. In a moving interview, she recently told Time that even though she’s been relatively private about her feelings about the experience, there’s a reason for it. “I don’t want to give it that much power,” Grande told the magazine while sobbing. “Something so negative. It’s the absolute worst of humanity. That’s why I did my best to react the way I did. The last thing I would ever want is for my fans to see something like that happen and think it won.”"
BUSINESS,"Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos is now the richest person on the planet after a bounce in company stock value floated his net worth to a massive $93.8 billion by the end of business on Friday. Bezos ended the day $5.1 billion richer than former No. 1 Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, 61, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Gates, with a fortune of $88.7 billion as of Friday, had previously held the king-of-hill spot since 2013 — except for a few hours. Bezos, 53, who also owns The Washington Post, briefly moved ahead of Gates in the rankings July 27 when his Amazon stock took off. The stock dipped during the day and Gates was back on top.  Amazon stock rocketed 13 percent on Friday, the biggest jump in 2.5 years, fattening Bezos’ portfolio by an extra $10.4 billion in a matter of hours. The booming stock performance followed a strong third-quarter earnings report that exceeded analyst expectations for the company, Bloomberg noted. Earlier this year, Amazon acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion, its largest acquisition to date. Gates first hit the big time in 1995 when he was 39 and his $12.9 billion fortune put him on top of the billionaire ratings. He dropped down in 2007 and didn’t make it to the top again until 2017, largely because he gave away tens of billions of dollars to various causes. Bezos has said he wants to give more money to charity. Warren Buffett was third in the latest ratings, with $88 billion in assets, followed by Amancio Ortega, Spain’s Zara clothing tycoon, with a $77.2 billion fortune, and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg with $75.4 billion."
ARTS & CULTURE,"""It's about an understanding of the relationship between the immaterial and gender,"" curator Charlie White explained in an interview with The Huffington Post Arts. White is describing the logic behind the ongoing exhibition ""SOGTFO,"" now showing at Los Angeles' Francois Ghebaly Gallery.  The title, for the uninitiated, stands for ""Sculpture Or Get The Fuck Out,"" a riff on the misogynist acronym TOGTFO (Tits Or Get The Fuck Out) sometimes lodged against women in virtual chat rooms and message boards. The disappointing proximity of gender-biased digital playground and the material, supposedly progressive realm of fine art, specifically sculpture, is where the exhibition finds its argument.  ""It's about how, even in the absence of space and object and physical existence, things are still deeply gendered,"" White continued. ""It's something that precedes any relationship to this exhibition, it's just part of my own cultural interest. Place and the body are not even required to create gender binary ideas. You can have nothing, you can be online, but when you claim your gender, somehow I am allowed to attack you for that or make you have to prove that. Which says the space that you're in still has no privacy.""  Those who've spent time on the internet -- especially its more amateur corners -- are likely familiar with lurking misogyny, in which women find themselves a target in a realm seemingly removed of bodies, space and gender. But how does the world of online misanthropy, where words like ""bitch"" and ""whore"" are casually slung about, relate to, let's say, the museum space?  ""You start with something like misogyny and the absence of the body online,"" explained White, ""and then look at the intersection between that and these ideas about objects, space and sculpture. When I looked at a space [like the internet] and its relationship to art and sculpture and object, I think, well that's maintained a kind of male privacy in those spaces. It's almost like looking at the most arcane version of it, and the most contemporary version of it, and saying there's not as much change as we might have imagined."" It's not masculine or feminine, gender-identified male or gender-identified female, it's super-male, more than male.  While the entirety of art history, as well as contemporary art, seems to lag a few centuries behind when it comes to gender equality, White believes sculpture is the most sexist medium of all. ""The object is more tethered to the body of its maker,"" he says. ""The author is kind of an extension of the form itself. And it's been dominantly masculine in that in late capitalism, where we are now, there's been a kind of, what I like to call, alpha object fetish. A super masculine object that's become dominant in this market and that's not only perpetuated that position but pushed it forward. It's not masculine or feminine, gender-identified male or gender-identified female, it's super-male, more than male. It pushes it a little bit further."" White specified sculptors like Richard Serra or Jeff Koons as examples of this super-male sculptural fixation, yet stressed that the problem stemmed far beyond this particular artists. ""It's very much about an attitude. It can be seen in space, in institutionalized spaces that are designed to hold a Serra or institutionalized, corporate environments that are set up to present Koons. I don't think this argument is limited in any way to what these artists are doing. It's really the whole picture. It's not just the artist, their studio and their product. It's the whole institution that builds a foundation, supports a market, creates a platform and presents back to the public.""  Just the very magnitude of museums and art establishments, implicitly asking to be filled, suggests the necessity of a masculine object massive enough to fill it.  The artists on view in SOGTFO are Amanda Ross-Ho, Andrea Zittel, Kelly Akashi, Kathleen Ryan and Nevine Mahmoud, artists who stood out to White because of the progressive nature of their approach toward sculpture. ""I don't want to say post-gender in an obvious way because their work wasn't about that. Their approach to work was about that."" White was familiar with all of the exhibited artists' work far before he started thinking about the exhibition, and the artists helped him solidify its argument. I tried as much I could to make it an exhibition about sculpture, that... doesn't base itself around 'five women who make sculpture.' ""It's about five artists from different but relatively fast moving generations, when they came into being as artists and what kinds of vernacular they adopted at that time. You have Andrea Zittel who established herself in the 1990s, you have Amanda Ross Ho who formed her practice in relationship to the first decade of the 21st century and you have a group of younger artists who became established in the second decade of the 21st century. It's a bit rapid, but at the same time, things change rapidly, and it's as much an example of a shift in mentorship between generations of artists that, in this case, are all women. It's about being able to have ideological predecessors that are women too, that set up a relationship to future object making.""  This is not a show about five women sculptors addressing the misogynist history of sculpture, he reiterates. This is not a show about five women sculptures addressing misogyny. This is not a show about five women sculptors. It's a show about sculpture (or GTFO). In White's words: ""It's about being emancipated from the problem, it's not about arguing the problem."" It's easy to detect White's resistance to label this exhibition as feminine or even feminist. Rather than highlight the fact that these are women sculptors, White hopes to remove gender from the conversation completely. This is a burden he places on the viewer. ""Ultimately the viewer is the responsible party for abandoning the notion of gender in relationship to their own subjectivity. Going into a space and having some form of gender binarism in mind and looking at work through that lens is problematic because it already has the position of patriarchy setting up that binary. You can't blame it on the market, singularly, you can't blame it on the knowledge of the exchange of the commodity that is art. You have to be able to have a relationship with the object individually and that relationship should exist, as best it can, outside these categorical notions of the object or the image or anything else. If the work itself presents those issues to you, that might be different. But if you graphed those images onto everything you see you are likely to be drawing lines around something based on gender that is more restrictive than it is political."" ""I tried as much I could to make it an exhibition about sculpture, that takes on this issue, but doesn't base itself around 'five women who make sculpture.' That's not the language of the show and that's hopefully not the way the exhibition should be seen."" White's exhibition challenges the viewer to remove the construct of gender fully from the overall digestion of the objects. Objects, that, hopefully, will continue to exist in a future when such binaries will no longer hold. ""I talk about objects as things that are designed to occupy a space in the future that's not yet here. There is a notion that when you're making objects, as much as it might be part of contemporary discourse, unless it is built to self-destruct, it's not really meant to go away."" SOGFTO runs until April 4, 2015 at Francois Ghebaly Gallery in LA. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Warning: if you haven’t watched “The OA” but plan to, we don’t recommend spoiling it by reading this post.  When Andy Weir first self-published The Martian ― a book that troubles itself with scientific accuracy, but not, say, the color of its protagonist’s hair ― it was a quick hit. His 99-cent ebook sold 35,000 copies before publishers took notice and Crown Publishing bought the rights. The rest is history. Or a version of it, starring Matt Damon. The book made it to The New York Times’ bestseller list, an impressive feat for a title belonging to the thought-to-be esoteric subgenre of “hard” sci-fi, or sci-fi concerned more with the “sci” half of the mashup. Readers reveled in Weir’s technical proficiency (his dad’s a particle physicist). Reviews were mixed, but leaned positive. A “B” review from Entertainment Weekly laments, “The men and women we see in action on the ship and at NASA are brainy but dour. Still, the technical details keep the story relentlessly precise and the suspense ramped up.” As readers, and viewers, it seems we can be more willing to overlook these character-centered shortcomings, more so than we’re able to suspend our belief for the unreal, or the accurate-ish. Just look at “The OA,” the surprise show that debuted at the tail end of last year, controversial for its ending ― called out as off-color by critics ― but also for its ethereal message. The eight-episode Netflix project follows a girl who’s returned to her hometown after a long disappearance. When she left, she was blind; now, inexplicably, she can see. The girl’s adoptive parents named her Prairie, but after her presumed abduction she calls herself “the OA,” a title that remains cryptic for much of the season. We learn that the OA had a near-death experience, or NDE, as a child in Russia, where she was the sole survivor of a sinking bus crash. Before the accident, she had ominous dreams that predicted it in flashes, and she always woke up with a nosebleed, a quirk that led reviewers to draw comparisons between “The OA” and Eleven from “Stranger Things.” (The connection is mostly superficial.) During her NDE, the OA tells a sort of goddess-guardian-oracle named Khatun that she wishes to return to Earth. And she’s able to, but at the cost of her sight. She’s then shipped off to America, where she lives with her absent, extended family until she’s adopted by the Johnsons, a kindly couple that raises her in the suburbs.  The OA ― who’s still going by Prairie Johnson at this point ― is tormented most nights by her nosebleed-inducing dreams, which she interprets as premonitions. The Johnsons view her behavior as problematic and seek to medicate her; whether she’s experiencing psychotic breaks or truly supernatural phenomena is left ambiguous on purpose. Eschewing empirical evidence in favor of an individual’s lived experiences, the show’s portrayal of Prairie ― and later, the OA ― is one of acceptance and imagination. When we’re asked to consider that her premonitions might have real, physical consequences somewhere beyond her reeling, traumatized brain, we’re forced to take them seriously. She’s more than just crazy; empathy is born.  This idea is threaded through as the story builds. We eventually learn that, during her absence, Prairie was held captive by Hap, a man doing research on NDEs, along with a rotating cycle of fellow abductees. He’s researching where they go when they nearly die ― what happens to their minds, or spirits ― by drugging them and drowning them over and over. We also learn that Khatun gifted Prairie a bird from the afterlife, which she swallowed, granting her the ability to dance or move in a specific way that feels, to her, important. It sounds like mumbo-jumbo belonging to the same family as healing crystals, but one of the other captives, Homer, is on board with her theory that they each must complete these coordinated movements together in order to escape. Over the course of years, the “movements” are born, these jerky gestures that look like either rituals from a far-off ancient land, or a trendy new workout fusing yoga with Zumba. (The OA, it’s worth noting, looks like she’s scoured the sale room at Urban Outfitters, further imbuing the show with this decade’s particular brand of New Ageiness.) When she’s set free, the OA makes her way back to the Johnsons, but yearns to return to Homer and the captives she left behind. She scrounges up a crew of high school students and one teacher, who for their own varied reasons are intrigued by the OA’s story and wish to help her. There’s Betty, a teacher who’s mourning her twin brother; Alfonso, a promising student-athlete who piles on responsibilities at home; Buck, a transgender teen; Jesse, a soft-spoken orphan; and Steve, whose violent tendencies could land him in military school. They become the OA’s captive audience, stand-ins for the family she lost in Hap’s damp basement prison. They learn the movements, not knowing when or why they’ll need to perform them in the future. Then, in the final scene of the final episode, it becomes clear: the OA’s crew performs their dance in the midst of a school shooting, and it’s so bizarrely distracting that the shooter pauses long enough to be taken out. The plot choice has been criticized and defended. Tasteful or not, it casts off the idea that it matters whether or not the OA’s premonitions are real or in her head. The effect is real, and that’s what counts. Not everyone agrees. Writing for Gizmodo, in a post titled “The OA Is Bullshit, But It’s Beautiful Bullshit,” Evan Narcisse says, “the lack of closure feels like a calculated ploy to avoid delivering a concrete answer to its central mystery.” But it would seem that the lack of closure ― of clarity about the OA’s true backstory ― is the point. The imagination, the show posits, is as real as the real world. And before you dismiss such a takeaway as wishy-washy, remember that it’s the crux of so many beloved stories. In the final installment of Harry Potter, Dumbledore upholds the realness of the imagination by reminding Harry, “of course it is happening inside your head [...] but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?”; in Where the Wild Things Are, Max’s wild rumpus matters not because it was or wasn’t a dream, but because of what the hero gleans from his adventures. In William freakin’ Shakespeare’s plays, the substantiality of false worlds is celebrated again and again. It’s arguable that the concept has helped shaped storytelling as we know it. Depending on who you ask, the concept is timeless or hackneyed. But it certainly isn’t cheap.  In a Facebook chat with The Huffington Post, writer Lidia Yuknavitch — whose Chronology of Water explores the fluidity of our bodies, our genders, and the stories we tell, and whose forthcoming novel, The Book of Joan, approaches sci-fi anthropologically ― praised “The OA” as a show about “desire toward meaning-making kissing desire of the body.” “I have a gigantic crush on the creative mind of Brit Marling,” she said. “I think we are in DIRE need of redefining what we mean by ‘spiritual’ today, away from old theologies and dead myths that relied on god the father. I think new paradigms are being born like new stars, bringing us closer to ourselves, and new forms and themes in storytelling are emerging. Thank the night sky.” She added that criticisms of the show as wishy-washy pseudoscience are unfounded. “I think it’s a little reductive to call ‘the OA’ a ‘spiritual’ show without adding to that the helix made of spirituality and astrophysics ... you know, hard science. The many worlds theory, string theory, the ‘music’ made from Saturn’s rings,” Yuknavitch said. It’s true that “The OA” is a new kind of science fiction, at least for mainstream audiences. But its heavy reliance on bald emotions, occasionally corny mantras and theories that could’ve been plucked from college dorm rooms doesn’t mean that it isn’t also rooted in the fascinating facts of the universe. Like its heroine, the show has a foot in reality, a foot in unreality. Asking it to commit to one or the other would only rid it of its wonder.

ARTS & CULTURE,"African art is sweeping through the mainstream art world as noted in recent examples from the Brooklyn Museum's Disguise: Masks and Global African Art to the Philadelphia Museum of Art's Creative Africa exhibitions. Aiming to ride this wave of momentum is a new photography exhibition by Denver-based artists Thomas ""Detour"" Evans and Tya Alisa Anthony. In They Still Live the two artists present a series combining DNA, African relics and African Americans in Denver. Credit: Tya Alisa Anthony of They Still Live/Model Willie Watkins wearing a Kpwan mask of the Baule people For the project, Evans and Anthony had each model conduct DNA testing, provided by Ancestry.com. Based on the results models were then photographed with pieces from the Paul Hamilton collection of African art that corresponded with their lineage. The series aims to question assumptions about identity, inspire research into one's heritage and promote global unity. We spoke with Evans and Anthony to learn more about their project, which runs June 30 to July 24 at RedLine in Denver, Colorado.    Recently there have been many stories on African Americans who are doing genetic tests to trace their roots. In this way your series is very timely. What cultural, social and/or political factors do you think has brought about this renewed interest? Tya Alisa Anthony: Advancements in technology have finally caught up to the desire of many African Americans looking to discover their heritage due to our complex history here in America. Where it would seem other cultures typically have the ability to trace their ancestral paths through documentation for example, African Americans typically have not possessed this tool. But now the affordability and process to submit a DNA sample has never been so convenient with the help of technology and the Internet. Thomas ""Detour"" Evans: I would also add that the initiative by people like Henry Louis Gates, Jr. has made a profound impact on the views of many. Gates' testing of hip-hop legends has created a narrative that learning about oneself is possible, liberating and cool. Credit: Thomas Evans of They still Live/Panama Soweto with Kota Reliquary How does this project address the reality of the uneasy relationship some black communities have with genetic technology due to the legacy of eugenics? Evans: During the process of bringing the project to life, I actually found that the opposite was true. I found that every individual I discussed the project with was ecstatic about the possibility of learning more about their lineage. Each person had stories that were passed down through generations and in a way became their unofficial identity. Although there has been a history of healthy skepticism towards anything related to genetics in the African American community, I see a shedding of the protective armor. I believe not only time, but the inclusion of African American owned DNA testing companies have played an important part in rebuilding trust in the industry. As creators of the project you both submitted to DNA testing. What were those findings and how did they impact your approach to self and the series? Evans: The results of my test revealed that I was estimated to be 91% African (29% Cameroon/Congo, 29% Ivory Coast/Ghana, 13% Mali, 11% Senegal, 3% Nigeria, 3% Benin and Togo, 2% other) and 9% European (4% Great Britain, 4% Ireland, 1% Scandinavian). The results were something that I expected, but to know the regions and the percentages was very liberating. Looking into the mirror I feel like I know myself a little better. I want to actually visit those regions, walk the land and experience the environment. Knowing that my identity is more than just the broad label of African American, I have a deeper connection with others around me.  Anthony: DNA results revealed my ethnicity is of West African descent from Benin and Togo. As a community driven visual artist exploring the theme of identity, the results have inspired me to continue to connect and research not only traditional but contemporary art and culture of my origins. I have found a spiritual and emotional connection to my heritage and look forward to where it will lead me in the future as a visual artist. Credit: Thomas Evans of They still Live/Ietef Hotep Vita in Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve In what ways do you hope this project challenges the concept of race in America?

Evans: I hope this project will open up more dialogue about how we define race, culture and ethnicity. I want people to leave thinking about the labels we place on ourselves and others, and start to raise questions when they see those labels juxtaposed to a rich and diverse background. Race has always been a contentious topic that is difficult to talk about. With more information about one's background, I see the conversation about race becoming more fruitful. People are able to dive deeper into the genetic makeup of America. Anthony: I hope this progressive project challenges and replaces the negative stereotypes and connotations placed upon generations of African descendants worldwide. The idea of race relations and perception of African descendants is not only an American conversation but a necessary global dialogue. Our complexities are what make us unique and should be respected as such.

ARTS & CULTURE,"If Neil deGrasse Tyson's version of ""Cosmos"" hasn't convinced you of the beautiful drama hidden within the scientific community, perhaps this dance opera -- filmed inside CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Switzerland -- will twist your arm in the right direction.  The gorgeous film project, titled ""Symmetry,"" combines the best parts of opera and dance with the titillating rigor of digital art and physics to create a visual narrative that explores the philosophical elements of the giant particle accelerator. The Creator's Project premiered the trailer for the epic film, which will be screened at the EYE Film Institute in Amsterdam on March 14 during the Cinedans film festival (a festival dedicated to dance on film) as well as the NewScientist CERN festival. Take a peak at the beautiful teaser below: The official description for ""Symmetry,"" written and directed by Ruben van Leer and choreographed by Lukas Timulak, reads: ""Inside CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the particle accelerator where scientists are studying the tiniest building blocks of the natural world and peering at the remnants of the explosive birth of our universe, an unlikely group of individuals in suits and construction helmets burst into dance."" The film centers on the interaction between dancer Slovakian-born, Netherlands-based Timulak and American soprano Claron McFadden, who illuminate the romance of the big bang, and the love laced into the search for the world's smallest particle. The piece is particularly relevant given the fact that the LHC is preparing for its second attempt at throttling particles together at speeds humans can't even fathom.  ""Symmetry"" is the perfect collision of science and art. Check out more of the dance opera here and let us know your thoughts on the project in the comments.

ARTS & CULTURE,"This weekend, a few dozen New Yorkers attended an event at Tibet House: an art tour by Tara Lobsang, a Tibetan artist born and raised in Tibet, educated in India, and now living in New York. The art exhibit, A Brush with Reality: Calligraphic Paintings of Tara Lobsang, opened last month and is currently on view at Tibet House. There is little in common between Lobsang and calligraphy. Calligraphy is an unforgiving art form that imposes strict limits on the boundaries within which the brush is allowed to travel. In old Tibet, students spent years copying the same sentences again and again on a wooden board in order to achieve the ability to write in a style matching that of their teachers. This was considered a great skill in Tibet - well, at least until the day Tibetans learned that foreigners had invented a strange machine called the typewriter.
The Colors of Samsara (24 x 36) (Photo: Jane Stein) Lobsang was never cut out for the rigidity and discipline of traditional calligraphy. At eight, he fought with his teacher. At ten, he was expelled from school. At eleven, he lobbed an axe into the back of a cow that belonged to a neighbor. At thirteen, he crossed the Himalayas and escaped from Tibet; after a month of walking, he reached Dharamsala, India, where he was enrolled into a Tibetan refugee school.  ""It was in exile that I first started to take a real interest in calligraphy,"" said Lobsang, ""because I no longer had to copy my teacher's handwriting. I was free to experiment and let my brush run on paper in all directions. There was nothing more liberating than taking that departure from the tradition within which I was trained as a kid.""  At the Tibetan Children's Village, Dharamsala, Lobsang grew up with hundreds of other children who, in search of freedom and education, had also been separated from their parents. Dharamsala is the seat of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government in exile, and one of the largest concentrations of Tibetan refugees in the world.
Ama - Mother (18 x 24) (Photo: Jane Stein) ""Being separated from my mother has been the greatest sorrow of my life,"" he said, describing a piece called Ama (mother). ""There is no love like a mother's love - genuine, unconditional, unchanging. As someone who has been separated from his mother for the last twenty plus years, this love is the one thing I've missed above all else, and I made this piece to represent that feeling.""
Lobsang speaks at Tibet House  After finishing high school, Lobsang moved to the United States, where he obtained a degree in filmmaking. In 2011, he made a film, Crossings, a short narrative about identity crisis. His separation from his family, and the pain he feels about the loss of his homeland, are recurring themes in his art. Lobsang has a love-hate relationship with his suffering. ""Where there is suffering, there is art,"" says Lobsang. ""Happiness is what everyone wants, but it is not the most fertile soil for art to grow. When we feel happiness, we just absorb it because it feels good. But when we feel suffering, we cannot absorb it, because it is toxic, and we must find a way to channel it out through some kind of expression. And when that expression is characterized by beauty and originality, that is when art is born.""
Mandala of Milarepa (36 x 36) (Photo: Jane Stein) One of my favorite pieces in the show was Mandala of Milarepa, a calligraphic representation of Tibet's most beloved saint from the twelfth century, whom Lobsang described as ""probably Tibet's first vegetarian."" Milarepa meditated in the barren mountains of western Tibet, where he lived on boiled nettles for years, until his body turned into the legendary green. He is said to have attained enlightenment within one lifetime.  Perhaps the most political and powerful of all the pieces in the show is Inferno, a work of terrifying force that addresses the wave of self-immolations in Tibet. In that masterpiece representing fire and smoke, I could see the eyes of the self-immolator staring intensely at me through the flames. These were not the eyes of someone pleading, or crying, or despairing; these were the defiant eyes of certainty, urgency and prophecy. The message was one of prophetic fire of Tibetan wisdom that will one day restore Lobsang's homeland and set his people free.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Margaret Atwood knows about political tumult. Over 30 years ago, she wrote a classic book about a society’s quick slide into a woman-oppressing dystopia. The title remains relevant; The Handmaid’s Tale is getting adapted for a TV series next year, starring Elisabeth Moss (of “Mad Men” fame). As an activist and writer of wayward worlds, Atwood is uniquely qualified to comment on political developments. And what she has to say about America’s recent state of affairs is pretty grim.  In a brief letter in support of and distributed by PEN America, Atwood wrote: When dictators of any kind, in any country, achieve power, they clamp down on writers and journalists first, because writers and journalists are alternative and frequently dissenting voices.  The Canadian author continued, “America has always prided itself on being a country where the freedom to write is valued. Please support and preserve that value.” She also referenced a line from The Handmaid’s Tale, connecting it with today’s environment of fake news and “cyberbullying from the corridors of our power.” While Atwood doesn’t name names in her plea, her implication is clear: Donald Trump’s many attempts to discredit the media are more than bad omens. They’re deliberate steps toward limiting freedom of thought. Atwood isn’t the first to make this claim. In a post headlined “Trump Won. The Media Lost. What Next?” NPR writes that the president-elect “avidly campaigned against” journalists. And his win hasn’t halted his media-shaming tweets. The plot of The Handmaid’s Tale is set in 2005, after the spread of false information ― a staged terrorist attack ― leads to the speedy renunciation of the Constitution, and revocation of women’s rights. In her letter, Atwood makes it clear that she doesn’t view her story as a playful “what if” scenario, but a warning against a possible future.  Read our interview with Margaret Atwood. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article claimed that Margaret Atwood wrote The Handmaid’s Tale 20 years ago. However, Atwood wrote the book in 1985 ― making it over 30 years old."
ARTS & CULTURE,"French artist Abraham Poincheval, who famously spent a week inside a rock and two weeks inside a bear sculpture, has succeeded in hatching chicken eggs after incubating them for some three weeks. Poincheval embarked on his latest project in late March of imitating a mother hen by incubating some 10 eggs with his own body heat inside a glass vivarium at Paris’ Palais de Tokyo contemporary art museum. At the time, he estimated it would take 21-26 days for the eggs to hatch and the first did so on Tuesday. A spokeswoman for the museum said on Thursday nine had hatched and the chicks were on their way to a farm.  For the endeavor, Poincheval sat on a chair, wrapped in an insulating blanket, over a container with the eggs. He could leave his seat for no more than 30 minutes a day for meals. Earlier this year, the artist spent a week inside a block of stone, while in 2014, he lived in a hollowed-out bear sculpture for two weeks."
POLITICS,"West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Don Blankenship on Tuesday said he saw nothing wrong with his use of a racial slur to describe the father-in-law of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). “This idea that calling somebody a ‘Chinaperson,’ I mean, I’m an American person. I don’t see this insinuation by the press that there’s something racist about saying a ‘Chinaperson,’” Blankenship said during a primary debate hosted by Fox News. “Some people are Korean persons, and some of them are African persons. That’s not any slander there.” Blankenship, a former coal CEO who served a year in prison for involvement in the deadly 2010 Upper Big Branch mine explosion, attacked McConnell’s ties to China last week by targeting the family of McConnell’s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. “I have an issue when the father-in-law is a wealthy Chinaperson and there’s a lot of connections to some of the brass, if you will, in China,” Blankenship said on a radio show. During Tuesday night’s debate, Blankenship repeated his claim that McConnell had “conflicts of interest with China.” The candidate has made attacking the Senate majority leader a centerpiece of his GOP Senate primary campaign. Blankenship called McConnell “Cocaine Mitch” in a campaign ad earlier this week, alluding to a 2014 drug bust on a shipping vessel owned by the company founded by Chao’s father. When debate moderator Bret Baier asked how Blankenship would work with McConnell if elected, given his penchant for “slinging insults,” he insisted it would not be a problem. “I’m not going to D.C. to get along,” Blankenship said. Blankenship is in a close race with other top GOP contenders to challenge Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) in November. Other Republicans in the May 8 primary include state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Rep. Evan Jenkins. "
ENTERTAINMENT,"Jada Pinkett Smith and her kin are confronting real issues on the web series “Red Table Talk” and this week, an admission from her daughter, Willow Smith, left her shocked.  On the latest episode about surviving loss, the now-17-year-old revealed that after the release of her hit single “Whip My Hair” in 2010, she “plunged into this black hole” and started to self-harm. “I feel like I lost my sanity at one point,” she told the “Girls Trip” star and her grandmother Adrienne Banfield-Jones. “It was after that whole ‘Whip My Hair’ thing and I had just stopped doing singing lessons and I kind was in this gray area of: Who am I? Do I have a purpose? Is there anything I can do besides this?” “I was cutting myself and doing crazy things,” she added.    Smith went on tour after the single dropped, but refused to finish an entire album despite interest from the record label. “Whip My Hair,” in case you forgot, went platinum and dominated the charts for weeks, but Smith, who was around 10 years old at the time, chose to back away from the spotlight. During that period is when Smith says she “totally lost my sanity for a moment” and retreated into herself, never sharing her struggle with her family.  “I had no idea,” a stunned Pinkett Smith told her daughter as she teared up. “I never saw any signs of that.” Willow has been open about the toll child stardom had on her mental health in a candid interview with Girlgaze last year, describing fame as an “absolutely, excruciatingly terrible” ordeal. Her parents’ careers didn’t help matters.  “The only way to get over it, is to go into it. You can’t change your face. You can’t change your parents,” she told the outlet. “When you’re born into it, there are two choices that you have; I’m either going to try to go into it completely and help from the inside, or ... no one is going to know where I am ... and I’m really going to take myself completely out of the eye of society. There’s really no in-between.” Smith would later return to music, having since released two albums, “Ardipithecus” and “The 1st,” and has even performed a revamped version of her debut single. “I never talk about it because it was such a short, weird point in my life,” Willow said on the web series, reflecting on her tumultuous preteen years. “But you have to pull yourself out of it.” If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

POLITICS,"Just two days after a young man opened fire on his classmates and teachers at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas, the National Rifle Association’s incoming president, Oliver North, blamed Ritalin and a “culture of violence.”   On “Fox News Sunday,” the controversial Iran-Contra figure told host Chris Wallace that the solution for the increasing number of school shootings ― there have been 22 so far in 2018, by one count ― is not gun control. “We’re trying like the dickens to treat the symptoms without treating the disease,” he said.  “And the disease in this case isn’t the Second Amendment. The disease is youngsters who are steeped in a culture of violence,” he said. “They’ve been drugged in many cases. Nearly all of these perpetrators are male. ... Many of these young boys have been on Ritalin since they were in kindergarten.” North’s comments on Sunday echoed those made by President Donald Trump after the Sandy Hook shooting in December 2012. Following the shooting, Trump tweeted about violent video games and the “glorification” of violence. Video game violence & glorification must be stopped—it is creating monsters! North, a retired Marine whose role in the Iran-Contra affair in the 1980s made him a household name, appeared in ads for the war-centered video game “Call of Duty: Black Ops II” and has also worked as a consultant for the game.  Other prominent Republicans have blamed violent culture, and not lax gun laws, in the wake of recent shootings, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. North is due to start as NRA president in the coming weeks.  CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated President Donald Trump’s remarks about video game violence made after the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting were made after this year’s school shooting in Parkland, Florida."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Ferrante Fever is spreading. A four-book series set in Naples in the 1970s, about friendship, political tumult and how our memories of childhood shift as we age, will be adapted into an HBO series, The Hollywood Reporter says.  HBO will partner with Italian broadcaster RAI to turn the books ― written originally in Italian and translated into English, among several other languages ― into an eight-part series.  The announcement comes as one of HBO’s first prestigious, woman-centric shows, “Big Little Lies,” winds down, leaving its mark as a critical success.  “My Brilliant Friend” will be set in Naples and filmed in Italian, and co-written by the author herself, who’s notoriously elusive. (Elena Ferrante is her pen name; her true identity was controversially revealed last year.)  It’s possible that the book ― an internal and reflective story, prioritizing personal relationships over a city’s surrounding tumult ― will be tricky to bring to the screen. But, with the author involved, it’s also possible that the show will be as brilliant as the book itself.

POLITICS,"The U.S. Marine Corps has launched an investigation into the activities of an avowed white supremacist in the military whom ProPublica and PBS’ Frontline linked to neo-Nazi assaults. Lance Corporal Vasillios Pistolis, 19, is stationed at North Carolina’s Camp Lejeune and assigned to logistics. He has been active with a number of neo-Nazi organizations, according to ProPublica and Frontline, which have linked six other current and former members of the military to neo-Nazi groups. “We’re looking into the allegations,” Naval Criminal Investigative Service spokesman Adam Stump told ProPublica. Stump would not discuss any details while the investigation is ongoing. NCIS typically investigates potentially felony-level offenses involving personnel in the Navy or Marines. The media investigations linked Pistolis to hate groups though records, photos and his own online comments to assaults during last summer’s deadly “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville. He bragged about the assaults online and was photographed appearing to beat a counter-protester. “Today cracked 3 skulls open with virtually no damage to myself,” Pistolis wrote online after the August rally, Frontline reported. 6/ In private online chats with other Atomwaffen members he talked about his desire to assault a gay man in Charlottesville and use his military training to kill his opponents “if shit goes down.” https://t.co/7d4tG3MEzX Pistolis has also been linked to the notorious Atomwaffen Division, an American neo-Nazi group that aims to incite a race war. Atomwaffen members, who idolize Adolf Hitler and Charles Manson, have been tied to five murders in the U.S. over a span of eight months, beginning last year. The group’s chat logs revealed chilling praise for the murder of 19-year-old gay Jewish college student Blaze Bernstein early this year. 2/ He also acted as a leader in the Atomwaffen Division—a secretive neo-Nazi group that talks abt overthrowing the US gov't & igniting a race war. Here’s a Tweet Pistolis sent. He pulled down his Twitter after @ProPublica & @FrontlinePBS contacted him. https://t.co/7d4tG44frv pic.twitter.com/SEeSWK49A9 Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) wrote a letter to Defense Secretary James Mattis on Friday, urging him to launch an investigation into Pistolis and any other members of hate groups who serve in the military. Ellison also called on the Defense Department to provide information to Congress detailing how the military screens for white supremacists or other hate group members before they join. “The involvement of service members in white supremacist or other hate groups is cause for significant concern, particularly given their combat and weapons training,” Ellison wrote. The news reports may indicate a “broader problem within the military,” he warned. Pistolis told ProPublica and Frontline that NCIS had questioned him about his activities months ago, but the investigation was apparently dropped. Sources told the media organizations there was an earlier investigation. HuffPost could not immediately reach Pistolis for comment."

ENTERTAINMENT,"No longer is “Who bit Beyoncé?” the biggest mystery on the internet. Former members of boy band *NSYNC reunited for a game of “Never Have I Ever” on Tuesday’s episode of “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” — and Justin Timberlake pretty much revealed that he once hooked up with a Spice Girl. But now everyone wants to know: Was it Melanie Brown (Scary), Melanie Chisholm (Sporty), Geri Halliwell (Ginger), Emma Bunton (Baby) or Victoria Beckham (Posh)? For the segment, host Ellen DeGeneres asked the five former bandmates (who split in 2002) a series of questions — and told them to answer by holding up a paddle which had “I Have Never” written on one side and “I Have” on the other. DeGeneres kicked off with a softball question about who’d hooked up with someone twice their age, before quizzing them on who had been romantically involved with a Spice Girl. Timberlake deliberated about how to answer as his former bandmates — Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, JC Chasez and Chris Kirkpatrick — held up the “I Have Never” side of their paddles. The “Man of the Woods” singer then reluctantly began to hold up the “I Have Never” side before DeGeneres firmly placed an “I Have” sign on his thigh, and he briefly flipped his own paddle to the “I Have” side too — to the delight of the audience. DeGeneres sadly didn’t press Timberlake — who dated Britney Spears and Cameron Diaz prior to tying the knot with Jessica Biel in 2012 ― on his answer, however."

ARTS & CULTURE," When Mark Twain mapped out the road he took to old age, he began by waving a caution flag that would make any Surgeon General's Warning look sick. Whatever you do, he told a New York audience in 1905, don't follow this road. He had reached old age, Twain said, in the usual way: ""By sticking strictly to a scheme of life which would kill anybody else."" He was joking, yet he was deadly serious. You simply can't achieve a happy old age by following another person's road. Well, you can't. Why not?  ""My habits protect my life, but they would assassinate you,"" he explained. So his number one piece of advice was to reject the vast majority of what passes for advice. You've got to find your own road and stick to it. And that's not as easy as it sounds, because there always will be someone waiting around each turn, eager to take all the joy and happiness right out of your life and replace it with misery and dreariness. But don't let them do it to you. If you can't reach old age by a comfortable road, he concluded, ""don't you go."" In Twain's view, you see, it was all about the journey.  	Before the world knew him as Mark Twain, Samuel Clemens was a skilled pilot guiding steamboats up and down the Mississippi River. As a writer, using his considerable gifts as a humorist and social critic, he also became an expert life pilot, wanting to guide both the individual and society toward those joyful and happy destinations. 	Some of this guidance is rough stuff, to be sure, but Twain makes it palatable with sly twists of humor. Also a wildly popular performer on the lecture circuit, he was something akin the leading standup comedian of his. Small wonder that George Bernard Shaw credited Twain with teaching him a vital lesson: If you're going to tell people the truth about themselves, you'd better make them laugh.  	I started pulling together Twain's thoughts on such matters in the mid-'90s, when it seemed everyone had his or her nose buried in some kind of self-help book. Something clearly wasn't working. We should have been the fittest, slimmest, trimmest, healthiest, wealthiest, happiest, least-stressed, best-adjusted, best-conditioned, best-natured, most-fashionable people in the history of the planet. We weren't. I began to think there might be a more helpful self-help book in Twianian advice that, back then, we would have slapped with a phrase gaining buzz currency, politically incorrect.  These observations were poured into Mark Twain's Guide to Diet, Exercise, Beauty, Fashion, Investment, Romance, Health and Happiness, published this month by Prospect Park Books. There are 20 chapters in this book, including ones on the two subjects we were told to avoid, religion and politics. Here's one blast from each chapter. Remember, Twain warns that aping his habits will kill you. But the idea with Twain is to die laughing:  Exercise: ""I have never taken any exercise, except sleeping and resting, and I never intend to take any. Exercise is loathsome. And it cannot be any benefit when you are tired.""  Diet: ""A full belly is little worth where the mind is starved, and the heart.""  Sleep: ""Well enough for old folks to rise early, because they have done so many mean things all their lives they can't sleep anyhow.""  Smoking: ""I have made it a rule never to smoke more than one cigar at a time. I have no other restrictions.""  Drinking: ""As for drinking, I have no rule about that. When the others drink I like to help.""  Staying healthy: ""The only way to keep your health is to eat what you don't want, drink what you don't like, and do what you'd druther not.""  Stress management: ""In certain trying circumstances, urgent circumstances, desperate circumstances, profanity furnishes a relief denied even to prayer.""  Anger management: ""If a person offend you and you are in doubt as to whether it was intentional or not, do not resort to extreme measures. Simply watch your chance and hit him with a brick.""

POLITICS,"In 1999, Scott Pruitt, then an Oklahoma state senator, introduced a bill to grant men “property rights” over unborn fetuses, requiring women to obtain the would-be father’s permission before aborting a pregnancy. Pruitt, now the embattled administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, submitted the legislation again in 2005.  The bill, which did not pass either time, faded from Pruitt’s political legacy. But the legislation merits new examination as the EPA chief faces down an avalanche of corruption accusations. As HuffPost previously reported, Pruitt’s support from right-wing evangelical Christians, a group that largely opposes abortion, has helped him keep his job amid calls from droves of Democrats and a handful of Republicans to fire the administrator. And while his current role atop the EPA does not give him any official control over abortion policy, he has appeared alongside President Donald Trump in meetings with evangelical leaders, and his draconian history on the issue is of a piece with the administration. In one of Trump’s first acts after taking office, he reinstated and expanded the Reagan-era “global gag rule,” withholding federal funding from charities and aid organizations that counsel women on family planning options that include abortion. Last week, the White House proposed a new “domestic gag rule” that would strip Planned Parenthood of funding. “It’s not surprising that another member of Trump’s inner circle is hostile to women,” said Dawn Huckelbridge, a senior director at the progressive super PAC American Bridge, which opposes Pruitt and supports abortion rights. “But framing a fetus as a man’s property is a new low.” American Bridge resurfaced the legislation and shared it with HuffPost. The EPA did not respond to a request for comment. Pruitt has spent his 15 months at the EPA pushing to keep government out of the private sector. He’s sought to radically deregulate the fossil fuel and chemical industries, clear the way for companies to produce more asthma-triggering pollution, allow deadly chemicals to remain on the market, and revise restrictions on teenage workers handling dangerous pesticides. By contrast, the bill from his time as a state legislator stated that “it is the responsibility of the state to ensure that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,” referring to a “fetus” as “property” that has been “jointly created by both father and mother.”  The legislation would have barred doctors from performing abortions without signed statements of permission from the father, or evidence that the man could not be located “after diligent effort.” If the pregnancy resulted from rape, the woman would be required to show “such assault has been reported to a law enforcement agency having the requisite jurisdiction.”  Doctors who performed the procedure without that documentation would have risked losing their medical licenses, been “civilly liable to the father of the aborted child for any damages caused thereby,” and had to pay punitive fines of $5,000. In a statement to The Associated Press in 1999, Pruitt said a pregnant woman who were to obtain an abortion without meeting the bill’s criteria would face legal consequences. “She’ll be held accountable for it,” Pruitt said. Pruitt also sought to restrict abortion in other ways. In 2001, when the Legislature was considering a bill to require that pregnant minors show parental permission before obtaining an abortion, he introduced an amendment to define a “fetus” as “any individual human organism from fertilization until birth.”  The timing of the bills came nearly a decade after the Supreme Court issued its landmark decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in which it ruled that provisions requiring a woman to obtain her husband’s permission for an abortion were unconstitutional. “He doesn’t agree with the court’s not viewing women as property and also doesn’t believe in the intellectual concept that women should have agency over their own reproductive choices,” said Leslie McGorman, deputy director at the advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America. “Frankly there’s not a whole lot more to tell except that he is the guy who his record indicates he is.” “He carries that lack of concern for the greater good throughout all of the things he’s done in his career,” she added, referring to his rollback of environmental safeguards. Until 2017, Pruitt served on the board of trustees at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, an institution that has said “a wife is to submit herself graciously” to her husband. Around the time he first introduced the abortion bill, in 1999, Pruitt served on the board of the MEND Medical Clinic and Pregnancy Resource Center. Its current executive director, Forrest Cowan, has said unwed mothers have been “failed” by a “boyfriend, who values his own selfish gratification over responsibility, and her father, who should have had her back.”  Pruitt’s crusade against abortion rights continued after he left the state Senate to become Oklahoma’s attorney general. When a district court found a law requiring women to undergo an ultrasound before an abortion to be unconstitutional, Pruitt appealed the decision to the Oklahoma Supreme Court. After losing there, he unsuccessfully petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to take the case. In 2012, The Tulsa World excoriated Pruitt in an editorial for wasting “more taxpayer money … on this misguided effort to control doctor-patient interaction and the practice of medicine ― but only when women are concerned.” "
ARTS & CULTURE,"We are smack in the middle of a fantastic festival season - and this year's Governor's Ball is no exception. In addition to a spectacular location and amazing food lineup, the famous 3-day festival (held this year from June 3-5) on Randall's Island has some solid acts on the bill this year, with major crowd pleasers like Kanye West, Beck and Robyn headlining. But as usual, our focus is on the acts that fly a little more below the radar. Here are 3 exciting emerging artists scheduled to perform that we think are worth checking out! WHO:  Galantis
WHEN: Sunday, June 5th @ 5:25pm
WHERE: Bacardi House Stage
WHY: If you pay attention to EDM at all, you've probably heard that Galantis is having a breakout year. The Swedish electro-pop duo (which consists of Miike Snow's Grammy-winning Christian Karlsson and Style of Eye's Linus Eklow) have a breakout international single, ""Runaway (U & I)"", and just wrapped up their first and very highly praised worldwide tour. Their live sets are everything a fan could want out of an EDM show - pulsating bass, wild lights and an infectiously crazy dance floor. Their festival/tour schedule is a bit sparse this year, so don't miss the fast rising Galantis @ this year's Gov Ball!
 WHO: Catfish and the Bottlemen
WHEN: Saturday, June 4th @ 3:00pm
WHERE: GovBallNYC Stage
WHY: BBC Radio 1 favorites Catfish and the Bottlemen are ready to take their refreshing brand of UK rock across the pond. The British band has seen some impressive success already this year, winning the awards for Best Breakthrough act @ the Brits, and their much hyped 2nd studio album (set to be released later this month) has them poised for international success. You can expect heavy guitar licks and belt-em-out rock tracks on the new record, but with a more tightly wound, fine-tuned sound than their debut album. Live shows are all rock-and-roll as well, with the passion of their fans clearly evident at their thrashing, almost always sold out gigs. Don't miss your chance to check them out on the big stage @ this year's festival!

WHO: Vince Staples
WHEN:  Sunday, June 5th @ 2:40pm
WHERE: Honda Stage
WHY: Even though he is only 22, Long Beach native Vince Staples has already made a name for himself in the biz through high profile collaborations with Odd Future and Mac Miller. But the rising hip hop star's solo career is just starting to take off. Staples' has a unique style - his first full length album, released on Def Jam last year, takes complex ideas and spins them into a unique style of 'conversational' rap. It's a style much evolved from his earlier work, and has made him an exciting artist to watch develop over the years. Staples puts on an incredibly inspired, high-energy show, so don't miss his Gov Ball debut in NY this June."
ENTERTAINMENT,"“Conan” will be changing the recipe come 2019. TBS announced Thursday that its Conan O’Brien-helmed late show will continue to air weeknights four times a week, but will switch to a “less structured” half-hour program. The move is meant to better engage with younger fans and evolve in the age of digital. “Conan” currently airs hourlong episodes on the network Monday through Thursday. O’Brien said of the changes: Since I inherited my “Late Night” show in 1993, TV has changed exponentially. I’d like to think I have evolved with many of these changes, but now it’s time to take the next leap. A half-hour show will give me the time to do a higher percentage of the comedy in, and out, of the studio that I love and that seems to resonate in this new digital world. It’s still going to be me hosting a very silly show, but I want segments on my half-hour program to link to digital content, deepening the experience for my younger fans, and confusing my older ones. This September will mark 25 years on the air for the comedian. To celebrate, Team Coco is partnering with TBS and NBC to put O’Brien’s entire 25-year catalog on their website. That includes his late-night tenures on both networks. That’s a lot of memorable sketches and characters that haven’t been seen for years. Remember “robot on the toilet” or the “masturbating bear”? Of course you do. You grew up with them. They’re part of who you are. Until then, you’ll just have to get your Conan fix Monday through Thursday at 11 p.m. ET on TBS and via his digital shorts."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Listeners aren’t wasting any time before getting hooked on “S-Town,” a seven-part podcast from the creators of “Serial” and “This American Life.”  The nonfiction series, which follows a man who restores antique clocks, has been downloaded more than 10 million times since its release on Tuesday, according to Variety. The entertainment news site reports that it reached the 10 million mark in four days, a podcast record.  All seven parts of “S-Town” were released at once. They’re meant to feel more like chapters of a novel than episodes of a television show, host Brian Reed told The Huffington Post last month. “My hope for it is that people listen to this kind of in the way that they would read a novel,” Reed said. “Maybe you do it all at once. You sit down and tear through it and that’d be awesome. I’m not saying you shouldn’t do that.” The main character of “S-Town” is John B. McLemore, whose nickname for his hometown of Woodstock, Alabama ― “Shittown” ― inspired the title.   “It’s a worldview, basically. And we hope that the title points you to that,” Reed told HuffPost. “That it’s a way that John saw the world, and I think a lot of people see the world that way. I think it’s something worth interrogating.” McLemore originally contacted Reed in 2014 about looking into a death in Woodstock, but the series is less a true crime investigation than “a deep dive into one man’s mental health” and “the insurmountable challenge of living that any of us might seem to face at one point or another,” as Vox put it.  “S-Town” is a project of Serial Productions and created by a group of radio and podcasting heavy-hitters who worked on “This American Life” and “Serial,” including Ira Glass, Sarah Koenig, Julie Snyder and Starlee Kine.  Serial Productions had a major hit in 2014 with “Serial,” the true crime podcast Koenig narrated that investigated the 1999 murder of high school student Hae Min Lee and her ex-boyfriend Adnan Syed’s claim that he was innocent. The first two seasons of “Serial” have been downloaded more than 250 million times, according to Variety.  “S-Town” is available for free download on its website,  iTunes, Stitcher, and other podcasting platforms."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Weeks ahead of the forthcoming Hulu adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale, a classic dystopian novel by Margaret Atwood, the author and the series’ star, Elisabeth Moss, discussed the story with Time.  The show, like the novel, follows a woman named Offred, who’s been enlisted as a “Handmaid,” or sex surrogate, for a couple with fertility issues. This setup is the norm in Gilead, a religious fundamentalist society that formed as a response to mass infertility.  And while the premise may seem extreme to some readers ― in fact, early reviewers of the novel dismissed it as implausible ― Atwood asserts that the world of The Handmaid’s Tale is nothing new.  “I made nothing up,” Atwood said in the Time interview, citing the Salem witch trials of the 17th century as an example of women’s oppression. “The control of women and babies has been a part of every repressive regime in history,” Atwood continued. “Not much has changed.” While the show was planned and shot before the 2016 presidential election, Atwood has taken its release as an opportunity to discuss today’s political issues, releasing a letter from PEN/America about the dangers of tyranny and speaking out on Twitter. And she doesn’t seem to plan on going anywhere soon: In a recent audiobook update, Atwood hinted at the possibility of a sequel. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Cutting edge, trendsetter fashion? Yes!But in Boston? Don't make me laugh! C'est impossible, right? Wrong. When I moved back here three years ago from Washington, DC (not exactly the epicenter of fashion either but several measuring tapes ahead of Bean Town), I bemoaned the lack of intentional fashion, as opposed to the accidental or incidental that is Boston's paradigm.  Determined to uncover any latent possibilities, I set out on a style quest that has turned up a few gems.   Most recently, Massachusetts College of Art and Design (MassArt)'s formidable fashion design curriculum and senior collections made me a believer. On May 9, 2015, the art school that parallels New York City's Fashion Institute of Technology and Parsons fashion design programs showcased its 108th student fashion show, entitled ""Vision."" (A previous commitment kept me from the show itself, but I viewed several of the collections beforehand.) Anna Wintour and Tim Gunn surely would have coveted my first peek at these boutique-ready garments. MassArt professor James Mason, himself a 2006 alum who worked in retail as well as designed his own collections before returning to teach, curated this year's show. He, along with other department instructors, help hone the skills and dreams of the young, talented designers. The program doesn't force themes (à la Project Runway) upon students, but rather allows them ""to do what they do best,"" says Mason, adding, ""I love what I do."" While a student entering the Fashion Design program need not have sewing skills, s/he must possess a passion for fashion. Senior Megan Reynolds, whose collection, ""Pangaea Apocalypse,"" I found to be one of the most moving, said her inspiration was ""the apocalypse... with survivors picking up and creating their own personal style."" She employed silhouettes that juxtaposed a half skirt shape with trousers and colors (some hand-dyed with curry and turmeric) that mixed winter with fall. It is a remarkably emotional collection for someone of Megan's youth because of the maturity of fabric and color selection and the courage of its interchangeable gender notes and androgyny. It was no surprise she cited recent CFDA awardee Hood by Air as one of her designer inspirations.
photo by: Keitaro Yoshioka MassArt seniors work on their final collection for the entire year. They are given carte blanche in terms of self-expression. Over the course of four years, students study pattern drafting, illustration, computer creation, draping, women's and men's wear, tailoring, made-to-measure, bridal, fashion history and more. They also spend time working in teams. By sophomore year, they have finished three full garments; by junior year, seven and senior year, 10. According to Megan, MassArt gives students ""time to create... and think things through,"" along with training in ""craftsmanship."" Although I was only able to view a portion of the featured fashion lines, I was duly impressed. In addition to Megan Reynolds, the following designers offered unique and highly polished collections: Emelie Bergh's ""Second Shift"" collection showcased soft, transparent and hand-dyed fabrics crafted with painstaking detail.
photo by: Richard Bertone Victoria Braga's ""Sweet"" was inspired by homemade desserts, hence the peach, white and gray palette, silk screened fabrics and smoothly interchangeable pieces.
Photo by: Pino Domenico Kim Nowers showed her ""Theresa Elizabeth"" collection, aptly titled because it felt quite erudite with its burgundy palette, hand-applied rosettes, exquisite fit and Charles James worthy draping.


Photo by: Richard Bertone Lindsay Hills titled her collection ""Distress"" meant quite literally.  Items often featured unfinished hems or torn edges on soft fabrics and dark palettes mixed with harsh elements such as belts and suspenders.

Photo by: Allysa Duncan Margaret Galvin's ""Inferno"", based on  Dante's Inferno, explored lavishly clad characters in looks like mashed red velvet suiting, burnished leather or soft, pure white folds.
Photo by: Pino Domenico Rachel Krafton's ""Framework"" played creatively with new shapes, a mixture of textures including non-traditional fabrics constructed to display metaphors such as the wearers being ""the same women though all not going to the same place.""
Photo by: Richard Bertone And finally, the narrative in Carly Hempel's  ""You Need Me"" reflected on ""women's bodies and insecurities."" The models appeared confident, though, highlighting clothing that hugged the body via soft knits and impeccable construction lines.
Photo by: Richard Bertone As I listened to student designers discuss their work with faculty panelists, I was struck by their varied methodologies as well as the diversity of the designs themselves. Some had complex stories and descriptives while others eschewed any deep meaning or explanation.   My only regret is that I did not see all of the collections as I'm certain there were many more showstoppers. With each senior class show, MassArt continues to establish its firm fashion footing well beyond Boston while concomitantly securing Boston's often elusive style presence."

ENTERTAINMENT,"It seems like Michelle Wolf’s unapologetic performance at White House Correspondents’ Association dinner on Saturday had quite the impact on Kathy Griffin — especially the backlash over the comic’s routine. On Monday, Griffin publicly retracted her apology to President Donald Trump almost a year after she posed with a fake severed head that bore his likeness and was roundly chastised for it. “By the way, I’m taking the apology back,” the comedian said on “The View.” She then uttered a short phrase that the program bleeped out; the Mediaite outlet reported that she said, “Fuck him.” The 57-year-old extended her withdrawal to Don Jr. and Eric Trump as well, referring to the president’s two sons as “Eddie Munster and date rape,” respectively. “Look, I’m not holding back on this family,” she said. “This president is different and I have been through the mill and so now I’m back on the road.” Griffin said she regretted saying she was sorry to Trump because it just made her “part of the Trump wood chipper, which Michelle Wolf is in now.” She said all she intended to do with her controversial photo ― which, among other repercussions, caused CNN to drop her as co-host of its New Year’s Eve show ― was to “make a statement about what a misogynist” the president is. Griffin, who attended the correspondents’ dinner, wrote a lengthy Twitter thread on Sunday that pointed out the hypocrisy of the criticism Wolf has received, especially from journalists. “So journalists are willing to demand that a comic hired to roast people apologize but they aren’t willing to demand that Trump or his staff apologize to people? Is that where we’re at now?” she wrote. Griffin had used an appearance on an Australian TV talk show last August to previously say she was sorry for saying sorry. During Griffin’s “View” appearance, she was asked if she felt that her photo shoot with Trump’s bloody head in May 2017 went “too far.” “No, not now. Not when I see his policies,” Griffin replied. “But now you’ve taken the apology back aren’t you frightened they’re going to go after you again now?” co-host Joy Behar asked. “Why do you do that to yourself?” “It’s important,” Griffin said. “The First Amendment is the First Amendment for a reason.

ARTS & CULTURE,"""Warsaw,"" a 35-minute video, is part of the ""Letters to Afar"" exhibition at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco, on view through May 24. Courtesy of the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, New York ""Once upon a time"" is a phrase we use for fairy tales and fables. Yet most Jews carry with them another time, another land, another city. It could be the Pale of Settlement or Vilnius, Krakow or Lvov or, in more recent times, the Lower East Side, the Bronx, Tehran, Moscow, Buenos Aires or even the Tel Aviv that once was. Perhaps in the future we will say the same for Paris, Manchester or Copenhagen. Quien Sabe?

That feeling of being in two places, two time periods, at once, is part of the experience of ""Letters to Afar,"" a remarkable exhibit on view through May 24 at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco (CJM), a video and sound installation by Hungarian artist Péter Forgács that combines Polish/Jewish ""found footage"" (home movies, travelogues) made between 1918 and 1939 with music by the Klezmatics. ""Letters to Afar"" is installed in the upper-floor galleries of the CJM's Daniel Libeskind-designed building. Films, for the most part taken by American Jews on return visits to Poland, each from different Polish cities, including Warsaw, Krakow, Grodek, Lodz and Vilna, are projected onto the walls of the darkened galleries, or onto multiple scrims, which endow the imagery with a ghostly presence, sometimes doubling the films horizontally, so that the same film is shown twice but not always showing the same images at the same time, or in different magnifications; or three films stacked vertically -- forcing us to compare, contrast and take in the complex multiple details of each lost world.  The installation is austere, the effect contemplative, reverential -- the effect is not ""we are there"" so much as to create the feeling that we, in the here and now, are drifting through some limbo of past Jewish experience. There are benches and pinpoints of light where one can stand and listen -- at times to klezmer strains, at others to atonal, ambient, classical or dissonant sounds. Occasionally, we hear narration of the travelogues on view. Some of the films include identifying text, most do not.  The exhibition has no set unfolding. Rather, visitors are meant to wander about freely and see what they can (to see all the film being projected would take an estimated six hours). The entire installation is one artwork, ""a composition ... one total installation where all elements of different films are in interaction with each other,"" Forgács said. ""We wanted to create this immense richness of life that was crushed."" We look at the faces, some of which look contemporary, others from the past, and still others appear as if unchanged from shtetl life centuries ago. We don't know these people, and yet we feel we do. For example, I experienced a ""Back to the Future"" time-travel shock in seeing on film Max Weinreich, the YIVO's founder in 1935 at its headquarters in Vilna -- a person and a place I had read about but never in my wildest dreams imagined being able to see.  It was surreal.  As Forgács explained in an interview, ""The hidden history is on the films."" As these are home movies or educational or travel films, the images are pedestrian, of everyday life. ""There are no home movies about divorce or heart attacks,"" he said. His work is not meant as ""an informative documentary."" Instead, Forgács is trying to create an encounter with ""the gestures, the winking, the smile, the movements ... the silent emotions that we read and [that make us] aware of these beautiful things."" In his work, Forgács creates the context and the drama. ""I like operas, not documentaries,"" he said, describing his films as attempts to ""slow down time."" ""My work,"" Forgács said, ""is much more than my words."" Forgács was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1950. Since 1978 he has made more than 30 films and is best known for his series ""Private Hungary,"" which recontextualized Hungarian home movies from the 1930s and '60s -- showing private lives that we know will be subsumed by the tsunami of European history, one that occurs, as Forgács put it, ""off screen."" In 1983, Forgács established the Private Photo & Film Archives (PPFA), a collection of amateur film footage from the 1920s. Angelenos may recall the artist from his 2002 multimedia installation at the Getty Research Institute, ""The Danube Exodus: Rippling Currents of the River."" That project, made in collaboration with Marcia Kinder and the Labyrinth Project at USC, contrasted film of Slovakian Jews aboard a ship trying to escape to Palestine with a later ship of Bessarabian Germans trying to flee the Soviets. ""Letters to Afar"" came about, Forgács recounted, by a confluence of fortunate circumstances. He received a phone call from Frank London of the Klezmatics suggesting they collaborate on a project involving a collection of films at YIVO, the aforementioned Jewish cultural preservation society now housed in New York (and where London's fellow Klezmatic Lorin Sklamberg has worked since 1987). Steven Spielberg's Righteous Persons Foundation funded the collection's digitization. The next stroke of luck was when the Polin Museum of the History of Polish Jews agreed to commission the work, focusing on Polish Jews during Poland's Second Republic from 1918 to 1938, the period during which a Polish democratic state was created, and Jews, who were granted civil rights, flourished until the Nazi invasion on Sept. 1, 1939. The Galicia Museum is responsible for a related exhibit presently on view at the CJM, ""Poland and Palestine: Two Lands and Two Skies,"" a collection of 50 images from a discovered trove of 15,000 images made in the 1930s by Ze'ev Aleksandrowicz, which is displayed just outside the entrance to ""Letters to Afar."" Its presence adds to the feeling of being in two places (or more) at once. In ""Letters to Afar,"" Forgács has created a memory play. The past, ours and that of the Jews in ""Afar,"" are but threads in the tapestries of our collective consciousness reminding us that, as the Jewish partisans used to say, ""Amchu."" The Jewish people are one and will always be, although not always in the places we used to be. ""Letters to Afar"" continues at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco through May 24.

It is also, in a way, about something that happened a few weeks ago.  “The other day,” Rees told me recently, “I was in my pajamas getting ready to walk my dog in the building where I live.” A white guy, “trying to be friendly,” struck up a conversation. “Oh,” he asked, “are you with the dog walking service? Can I get your card?” Rees smiled, though clearly unamused. “I said, ‘No, I live here.’” “Mudbound” is a movie about small moments like these, which almost every black person can relate to. Perhaps no other film has done a better job of capturing the role of emotional labor in the story of race in America, of teasing out the connection between the physical and emotional labor of black folk in this country. The story centers on two families, the McAllans (white) and the Jacksons (black). Henry McAllan (Jason Clarke) moves his wife Laura (Carey Mulligan), two daughters, and ornery father Pappy (Jonathan Banks) onto a large plot of farmland in Mississippi. The McAllans own the land, and Hap and Florence Jackson (Rob Morgan and Mary J. Blige), sharecroppers with four children of their own, work the land. Hap and Florence’s eldest son, Ronsel Jackson (Jason Mitchell), and Henry’s younger brother, Jamie McAllan (Garrett Hedlund), strike up an unlikely friendship based around the shared trauma of the war. The friendship ultimately leads to tragedy. “Mudbound” begins and ends with acts of labor that are layered with meaning. In its first moments, we watch the McAllan brothers dig a muddy grave for their recently deceased father. Later, we watch Henry ask Hap, passing by with his family, to help them lower Pappy into the ground. The dead man was a virulent racist, one who bombarded the Jacksons with his disdain; a man who, as we learn later, endangered the lives of Hap and his family. In that moment, all of this history is left unspoken.  Halfway through the narrative, Florence must leave her children and gravely injured husband in order to tend to Laura’s two sick daughters. It’s an act she says, via internal monologue, that she’d vowed never to do ― to put the needs of someone else’s family over her own. This is the reality of being black in America. “Their lives can be interrupted at any moment,” Rees explained. “You could be reading a letter from your son who is away at war, or having dinner with your family,” she said. “But at any moment you have to stop doing what you’re doing. Your family connections are displaced or your emotion is displaced, and suddenly you have to perform someone else’s convenience.” She is speaking of emotional labor, a concept wound up tightly with the story of white and black America. Emotional labor is the folding and contorting of one’s own emotions for the benefit of others, in order to put them at ease, making space for their feelings by burying your own. In the context of race, this means ignoring offhand racist comments and microaggressions for the sake of keeping the peace, absolving white people of their guilt and swallowing righteous anger.  Emotional labor is not an inherently negative thing. But it becomes so when it’s compelled, without any promise of reciprocation. Black people, especially black women, have perfected the art of emotional labor for the sake of survival.  There is a constant assumption that black women have a bottomless capacity to provide emotional labor for nothing in return. The “Mammy” figure is the personification of this idea: a woman who is always jovial, who is devoid of personal desires, who always places the well-being of the white people she serves above her own ― not because she works for them, but because it is in her nature, embedded in her very DNA. This is what’s at play here, as Florence and Hap navigate the constant intrusions of the McAllan family, who demand physical and spiritual work from them with sheepish smiles that suggest a false sense of solidarity, even understanding.  Stuck at the McAllan home for days as the girls recover and as her own children and husband must cope at home without her, Florence shares a few tender moments with Laura, bonding with her as one mother to another. The next night, Pappy arrives home and accosts Florence with racist taunts and slurs and threats of violence. Laura looks on in silence as Florence de-escalates the confrontation by herself.  The McAllans and the Jacksons are tied together, tied to this land, whether they like it or not. It’s a perfect metaphor for race in America itself ― a problem that’s more than just a problem, that isn’t the burden of just one group but of many.  Because the other crucial thing “Mudbound” explores is the idea of inheritance. We inherit the burden of race, we inherit the burden of emotional labor, and we inherit not just the notion of whiteness as a form of social wealth, but the wealth itself ― just as we inherit the land and the power that goes with it. “Each of the McAllans has whiteness as currency,” Rees said. “They just spend it differently.” “Pappy flaunts his,” she went on. “He’s calling Ronsel a nigger and making him use the back door. Henry may not be calling you names, but he’s happy to walk up to your window and say, ‘Hey, get up on your broken leg and come help me out.’ And Laura, she barters with hers. She’s ‘asking’ Florence to help her girls, but she’s not asking.” “And then with Jamie, he tries to pretend he doesn’t have it, which is equally as dangerous,” Rees added. “By pretending he doesn’t have his privilege, he endangers Ronsel’s life.” In this way, the McAllans are whiteness in all its various shades, all the shades of complicity that come with choosing to accept or reject whiteness as a currency. By the end of the film, after its brutal conclusion, it’s hard to tell which of the McAllans ― Laura, Pappy, Henry or Jamie ― is truly to blame for all the bad things that have transpired between both families. And that, probably, is the point.  “A lot of people say, ‘I’m not racist,’” Rees told me. “I think what they’re really saying is, ‘I don’t hate.’ But you can be racist without being hateful.”  This idea, that one can be racist without being hateful, reverberates through the world of the film and, of course, through the real world as well. The image of Florence nursing the grandchildren of a man who calls her a black bitch lies on the same continuum as Dee Rees, a queer black female director, being mistaken for a dog walker by her white neighbor in Brooklyn. Pappy is hateful. The white neighbor isn’t. And yet they operate within the same system; they demand the same emotional labor, the same compromising of one’s emotions.  Art about race, about America, should not live in the past. In this respect, “Mudbound” is a film that’s brilliantly contemporary in the way it explores race ― not as a concept, as a tool for a teachable moment, as a way to shock or awe an audience as some films about race in the past year have done. It has no agenda and no “lessons” to teach.  Some people glibly predicted in the days after Donald Trump’s election that it would inspire more meaningful and profound art. But many films about race in America that have been released in the past year, such as “Detroit” and “Beatriz at Dinner,” have had an unfortunate tendency toward a flattening didacticism. The movies march grimly under the banner of their message, taking care not to implicate too much of the white audience. The dynamics of race in America are oversimplified rather than interrogated, and viewers are ushered toward a predetermined reaction. That’s not what Rees is up to in “Mudbound.” Her wish is for those who watch her movie ― white and black ― to investigate their own inner lives as much as the inner lives of the characters. “Unless you investigate what you inherit in terms of ideas, you know, attitudes and thoughts about the world, how can you be mindful about what you’re passing on?” Rees said. America is a shared dream, a shared trauma, a shared problem. We’ve all inherited it."
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — In 1970, President Richard Nixon laid out a plan to reorganize the federal government to better protect the environment. With strong bipartisan support from Congress, portions of the Department of the Interior and several other agencies were reshuffled to create the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In the 1990s, the research functions of several offices at Interior were consolidated to form the National Biological Survey and later transferred to Interior’s U.S. Geological Survey. Then in 2010, after the devastating Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Interior’s Minerals Management Service was divided into three new, independent agencies. Now Ryan Zinke, the 52nd secretary of the interior, argues, with some rhetorical excess, that the department is woefully in need of another overhaul. “If you can imagine a company or organization that hasn’t reorganized in 150 years, welcome to the Department of the Interior,” he said at an Earth Day event in Texas last month. Zinke then launched into one of his favorite talking points, a story about the challenges of overseeing a single body of water and the wildlife in it.  “Let’s say you have a trout and a salmon in the same stream. It happens all the time. Upstream you have a dam, downstream you use it for irrigation, and that stream passes by a Forest Service holding,” Zinke said. “So this is how we manage it. The salmon are actually managed by the Department of Commerce through [the National Marine Fisheries Service]. The trout is managed by me through [the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]. Upstream, water temperature and flows is generally the Army Corps of Engineers, unless it’s a hydro plant and then it’s Bureau of Reclamation ...” The tale goes on, referencing more agencies, but you get the idea. A lot of agencies have a stake in this complex situation. It’s one that Zinke says often results in conflicting and, at times, irreconcilable judgments about whether a certain action ― say building a bridge or an oil pipeline ― threatens the critical habitat or long-term survival of a species. “And you wonder why it takes 17 years to get a permit,” Zinke told the audience, without mentioning a specific example. “When I look at it, we are mismanaging our greatest treasures.” The intended takeaway is that government is dysfunctional, uncooperative and in need of the “bold” overhaul he promised one day after arriving at the Interior Department in March 2017. As the chief steward of America’s natural resources, Zinke is responsible for managing some 500 million acres of land, or one-fifth of the United States. Among his top priorities is reorganizing the Interior Department in a way that he argues will better oversee those vast resources and prepare the agency for future challenges. Details of his plan remain scarce, aside from promises to push more staff and resources away from Washington — to the “front lines,” as Zinke says — and vows to manage land and wildlife based on “ecosystems, watersheds and science,” rather than state borders. To accomplish the latter, he proposes to divide the country into 13 regions for purposes of Interior Department operations. That effort has already had its hiccups. In February, he redrew the maps for his proposed shakeup after Western governors, both Republicans and Democrats, warned that dividing up states like Colorado into several regions would further complicate management. And whatever the merits of internal restructuring along regional lines, it’s unclear how Zinke’s proposal would fix the trout-salmon scenario, lead to increased efficiency and better collaboration across government departments, or reduce the number of reports that must be produced. Zinke oversees only one department. He has no authority over many of the agencies in his trout-salmon situation ― namely the National Marine Fisheries Service (which is part of NOAA, within the Commerce Department), the Forest Service (Agriculture Department) and the Army Corps of Engineers (Defense Department). And so far, neither he nor anyone else in the Trump administration has publicly proposed doing away with or combining parts of these agencies or limiting their jurisdictions. In other words, the trout and the salmon — assuming Zinke is talking about threatened or endangered species of those fish, which are subject to federal protection and management — would continue to be the jurisdiction of Fish and Wildlife and NOAA, respectively. And all the other agencies inside Interior and out would continue to have the same authority and responsibility over the stream and surrounding ecosystem. Dan Ashe, a former director of the Fish and Wildlife Service under President Barack Obama, told HuffPost he can’t see how “reorganizing the deck chairs” at Interior changes the dynamic Zinke finds so problematic. “You’re not going to solve that complexity by reorganizing,” Ashe said. “You’re going to solve it by hiring skilled people and giving them the resources they need to do effective coordination.” Instead, as part of the reorganization, Zinke has advocated cutting up to 4,000 employees — a 16 percent reduction — and slashing Interior’s budget by $1.6 billion. In June last year, dozens of senior Interior staff were reassigned, many to roles for which they had no experience, in a move that a spokeswoman then claimed would “better serve the taxpayer and the department’s operations.” Ashe said Zinke’s statements suggest he’s moving toward giving certain offices or individuals at Interior the authority to make collective decisions on behalf of the entire department, thus sidelining the responsibilities of others. Zinke’s fish story may sound familiar. At his 2011 State of the Union address, Obama promised a major government reorganization, noting that the last one occurred “in the age of black-and-white TV.” “The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they’re in freshwater, but the Commerce Department handles them when they’re in saltwater,” Obama said. “I hear it gets even more complicated once they’re smoked.” As NPR pointed out at the time, Obama’s statement was not entirely accurate. Endangered salmon that spend most of their lives in the ocean remain the responsibility of NOAA regardless of whether they are at sea or spawning upriver. Salmon that live exclusively in freshwater are Interior’s responsibility. In 2012, Obama proposed one big shift to reduce government overlap in this area: move NOAA from Commerce to Interior. In announcing his plan, he took a shot at Nixon, saying his Republican predecessor “decided not to put NOAA in what would have been a more sensible place.” Congress never took action on Obama’s proposal. And NOAA, which focuses on conservation, weather forecasting and climate research, remains at a department tasked primarily with growing the American economy. David Hayes, who served as deputy Interior secretary under Obama, finds little to like about Zinke’s proposed reorganization. In the latest issue of The Environmental Forum, Hayes writes: “With the exception of one bright spot — Zinke’s proposal to establish a common regional structure for all of the department’s bureaus — it is difficult not to be disappointed in what remains a largely ill-defined plan to meet unclear goals.” At the event last month, Zinke echoed his previous comments about the reorganization and once again invoked his conservation hero, Theodore Roosevelt, who as president protected more than 230 million acres of public land. “It wasn’t popular about 100 years ago to take this country on a mission of [protecting] our public lands,” Zinke said. “But now we have to have the same amount of courage to look out for the next 100 years.” Hayes told HuffPost that Zinke already has the power to “effectively facilitate intra-agency cooperation” among the many agencies under his command. Both he and Ashe wonder why the Trump administration isn’t talking about bringing all agencies tasked with managing natural resources under one roof. “If you want to be bold ― like he says, Teddy Roosevelt bold ― then propose to bring the Forest Service into the Department of the Interior,” Ashe said. “If you are concerned about duplicative biological opinions between the Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA, then propose to consolidate those agencies.”  The Interior Department did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

POLITICS,"May 8 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc. said on Tuesday it had hired Essential Consultants, a company linked to Donald Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, to advise it on working with the new administration in early 2017, around the time of Trump’s inauguration. The business arrangement illustrates efforts by the telecommunications company to work with an influential adviser to the new president as his administration took up major industry issues and considered its $85 billion proposal to buy Time Warner Inc. Payments by AT&T were described earlier on Tuesday by Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels, who released a report alleging that a company owned by Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, AT&T and other corporations had made payments to Essential Consultants. Avenatti’s report said AT&T had paid $200,000 in four equal payments to Essential Consultants between Oct, 3, 2017 and Jan. 3, 2018. “Essential Consultants was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,” AT&T said in a statement. “They did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017,” it said, without commenting further. Reuters could not immediately verify Avenatti’s claim and it was not clear how he would have knowledge of any payment from Vekselberg to Cohen. Cohen and Avenatti did not respond immediately to requests for comment from Reuters. Daniels had previously said she was paid $130,000 by Cohen to stay quiet about a sexual encounter with Trump, an encounter which Trump has denied. The Wall Street Journal released a 2016 Delaware certificate of formation for Essential Consultants that was signed by Michael Cohen. A person familiar with the matter said AT&T engaged with Essential Consultants around the time of the inauguration to understand how the company would be affected by several issues from the new administration, including tax reform and net neutrality. The payments from AT&T in late 2017 and early 2018 came as it was advocating for its proposed takeover of Time Warner, which the U.S. Justice Department is trying to stop. The deal, announced in October 2016, was quickly denounced by Trump, who as a candidate and later as president has been critical of Time Warner’s CNN."
BUSINESS,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The Uber Technologies Inc. board of directors voted unanimously to adopt all recommendations from a report stemming from allegations of sexual harassment at the company and other employee concerns, a board representative said on Sunday. The board, at a meeting on Sunday, adopted a series of recommendations from former U.S Attorney General Eric Holder following a sprawling, multi-month investigation into Uber’s cultures and practices. The recommendations will be released to Uber employees on Tuesday, said the representative, who declined to be identified. Holder’s recommendations included imposing new controls on company spending, human resources and other areas where executives had wide discretion. Also at the meeting on Sunday, board members were expected to discuss Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick temporarily stepping away from the embattled ride-hailing firm and other changes to executive leadership. Kalanick has developed a reputation as an abrasive leader, and his approach has rubbed off on his company. The 40-year-old executive was captured on video in February berating an Uber driver. Uber board member Arianna Huffington said in March that Kalanick needed to change his leadership style from that of a “scrappy entrepreneur” to be more like a “leader of a major global company.” The board has been looking for a chief operating officer to help Kalanick run the company since March. The report was prepared by Holder and partner Tammy Albarrán at Covington & Burling. It comes shortly after another law firm, Perkins Coie, submitted a separate report on sexual harassment and other employee concerns at the company. On Tuesday, Uber responded to that report’s findings by saying it had fired 20 employees for a variety of reasons, and was increasing training and adopting new policies. Uber said that report considered 215 cases encompassing sexual harassment, discrimination, unprofessional behavior, bullying and other employee complaints.   MORE OVERSIGHT ON CEO? San Francisco-based Uber is valued at nearly $70 billion but has yet to turn a profit. Some of the recommendations in Holder’s firm’s report would force greater controls on spending, human resources and other areas where executives led by Kalanick have had a surprising amount of autonomy for a company with more than 12,000 employees, one person familiar with the matter said. Uber’s more than 1.5 million drivers worldwide are classified as independent contractors rather than employees. Less clear is the fate of Kalanick, who with close allies has voting control of the company. The person briefed on the matter said the board will discuss Kalanick taking time off from the company. The discussion involved the possibility that Kalanick might return in a role with less authority, this person said, either in a position other than CEO or as CEO with narrower responsibilities and subject to stronger oversight. Kalanick is also facing a personal trauma: his mother died last month in a boating accident, in which his father was also badly injured.   HOLDER INTERVIEWS Employees and former employees interviewed by Holder’s team complained about sexual and racial bias, bullying and retaliation, according to people familiar with their accounts. They said that Kalanick and his lieutenants had favorites who played by different rules than other employees, and that even those favorites were nervous that they could fall from grace, which they sometimes did. Uber declined comment on that characterization. One of the issues that came to Holder’s team’s attention, according to two people familiar with the matter, was the company’s handling of a crisis in India after one of its drivers was arrested for raping a customer. Though the man was convicted in 2015, Kalanick and other executives became convinced that the crime was a set up by a local competitor, former employees said. Eric Alexander, the head of Asian business, shared medical records internally that he argued showed that the woman had been assaulted but not raped, people who spoke to him said. Alexander was fired this week; he did not return messages seeking comment. Uber confirmed Alexander had left the company but declined to discuss the matter further."

American Ballet Theatre dancer Alicia Alonso in ""Swan Lake,"" 1945. (Photo by Maurice Seymour) A voluptuous new dance film airs Friday on PBS stations nationwide, timed to coincide with American Ballet Theatre's 75th anniversary celebration, and the opening of its season at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. Tune your DVR's and raise your champagne flutes.  Here's an exclusive glimpse of Misty Copeland in the new film:  Nearly a decade in the works, American Masters - American Ballet Theatre: A History feels more like an eccentric personal meditation, or a love letter to the art form, than a historical trek through the company's 75 storied years.  As the talking heads on the film point out more than once, the history of ABT is essentially the history of ballet in America, and with so much vital chronicling to pack into 83 minutes, you'd think the masterful Ric Burns would just get on with it, in chronological fashion. Instead, this turns out to be an erratic, head-spinning meander - punctuated by pearls of wisdom from dance historian Jennifer Homans, choreographer Alexei Ratmansky, critics Anna Kisselgoff and Clive Barnes, current artistic director Kevin McKenzie, dance legends Alicia Alonso, Freddie Franklin, and Lupe Serrano, and by some ravishing slow-motion cinematography, focused on a handful of current ABT principals and soloists.  Ballet to the People is not a fan of MTV-style quick-cuts and epic slow-mo in filming ballet, which often rob a work of context and meaning, reducing it to pretty acrobatics. But the slow-motion sequences captured in this film are breathtaking, revealing the ""deep intimacy"" that, in Homans' words, is the province of great ballet. Burns captures the fierce beauty of Herman Cornejo as Le Spectre de la Rose. The unexpected poignancy of Hee Seo's hand slipping lightly out of Cory Stearns' in Romeo and Juliet. We share Seo's ecstasy when Stearns catches her in mid-flight and supports her lightly under the rib cage as she floats around him, as if carried by a breeze. We are tempted to call 911 when a distressed Gillian Murphy tries to escape the clutches of the evil Marcelo Gomes in Pillar of Fire. We root for Daniil Simkin, as he battles his own invisible demons in Everything Doesn't Happen at Once.

(Photo: Buddy Squires, ASC) Viewers who find all the back and forth between eras and color commentators dizzying are urged to seek shelter on ABT's 75th anniversary website. The succinct, year-by-year timeline you will find there is perforce dry, but a welcome and essential anchor for the company's rich, sweeping history.

Homans' insights are fascinating. ""Rules are a form of power,"" she reminds us, when explaining how ballet evolved in a highly codified manner in the court of Louis XIV.  The story of ballet in the 20th century is really the story of the confrontation between Russia and America... of Lucia Chase struggling with the Russians to make an American company, trying to redefine a Russian tradition in American terms... how boring would it be if it stayed an Imperial art? It couldn't, in America!
- Jennifer Homans in American Masters - American Ballet Theatre: A History Burns slyly slips in a quip from Ratmansky who, without naming Homans, rebuts the controversial charge she makes in her admirable and ambitious history, ""Apollo's Angels,"" that ballet has never recovered from the death of Balanchine, the last great master.  Elsewhere, the long-winded exegeses on the magic of dance start to pale, and Ballet to the People got the sense that the director was so enamored with the dancers that he couldn't bring himself to edit their giddy commentary. By our reckoning, he could have substituted 15 more minutes of precious archival footage.  That back catalog is ABT's unique edge, which Burns largely failed to exploit: performance, rehearsal and tour footage that no other company in the world can match - not even the Russians and the French, who do not boast a similarly expansive repertory. Ratmansky made a point of identifying ABT as the incubator of new, experimental work from all the great choreographers of the 20th century, from the very start of its existence - experiments that not only expanded style and technique, but also the subject of dance, as choreographers like Antony Tudor, Agnes DeMille and Jerome Robbins made works about real people and their conflicts, not just about mythical creatures, noblemen and goddesses. Clive Barnes points out that ABT is the only major company that has never occupied its own theater, a perennial nomad that has brought its groundbreaking rep not just to major cities worldwide, but also to small towns all across America. This being ABT, partisan fans will no doubt whinge over the lack of footage of Makarova, Fracci, Nagy, Kirkland, Gregory, Bujones, Van Hamel, Ferri, and other legendary dancers. (Baryshnikov gets some airtime, having been artistic director for a decade.) The historical focus of this film is on choreographers rather than on individual dancers.  Yet the biggest draw at ABT has always been its star dancers: the Russian defectors of the 20th century, the Russian jetsetters of the 21st century, the Cubans, South Americans, and a formidable brigade of homegrown American talent, including matinée idol Ethan Stiefel, and media sensation Misty Copeland. It is mainly the current crop of rising stars who are seen dancing in this film, but celebrating 75 years with so few clips of the stars of yesteryear feels like an egregious omission.

(Photo: MIRA) Here's hoping that Burns - who had a hand in the epic series The Civil War with brother Ken, and, more recently, Enquiring Minds: The Untold Story of the Man Behind the National Enquirer, a look at America's obsession with gossip and the cult of celebrity - will film a prequel and give some of the legends their due.

(Photo: Paul B. Goode) Some choices of footage in this film were disappointing. Rather than show us the incomparable Natalia Makarova dancing, or coaching a soloist in a lead role, Burns captures a trifling moment in the studio with young, awe-struck students. Yes, Makarova is charming and impish in this scene, but it hardly rates inclusion when there is so much else of her available in archives. Other snippets of company class and rehearsal are shapeless, suggesting that whoever edited them didn't know what an ""ah-ha"" moment in the ballet studio looks like. Burns serves up plenty of champagne along with the Prosecco, however. The most sublime moment is probably the magnificent splicing of footage from the 1940's of Nora Kaye and Hugh Laing in Tudor's Pillar of Fire with contemporary footage of Gillian Murphy and Marcelo Gomes in the same roles. Similar wizardry is performed with 1940's footage of Alicia Alonso and Igor Youskevitch in Balanchine's Theme and Variations and Isabella Boylston and Cory Stearns in the same roles, as Jennifer Homans in voice over deconstructs the genius of this work.

(Photo: George Seminara) Compared to most ballet companies, both in America and overseas, ABT has come late to movie night. It has released comparatively few filmed performances on DVD, and only recently established a YouTube channel, so far populated with a handful of bland, assembly-line videos with no stamp of originality. It is playing catch up to those companies who have figured out that film and video are essential to building audiences. So this documentary is critical for ABT.  What will its legacy be? Kisselgoff identifies ABT as ""a company for dancers who want to dance a broad, mixed rep and extend their talents. The challenge for dancers is how to excel in all the styles"" - especially true for a large company in which leading roles are parceled out among so many that individual soloists get little time on stage to hone their artistry. Ric Burns might find this an intriguing subject for his next love letter."
ENTERTAINMENT,"“Doesn’t Look Like Anything To Leigh ... And Bill” is HuffPost’s weekly recap in which we break down the craziest thing you might have missed on “Westworld.” This week: Season 2, Episode 2, “Reunion.” If the connections between “Westworld” and a certain, mysterious stock image have flown under your radar, we have some new information that might finally pique your interest. Remember, back in Season 1 of the HBO series, when Dolores’ (Evan Rachel Wood) father Peter Abernathy (Louis Herthum) short-circuited after discovering a picture of a woman posing in New York City’s Times Square? In the show’s fictional universe, the photo is a shot of Juliet, sister to parkgoer Logan (Ben Barnes) and the eventual wife of William (Jimmi Simpson and Ed Harris), aka the Man in Black. A mere glimpse of the real world beyond Peter’s robotic realm seemingly caused him to malfunction. Mr. Abernathy’s frazzled moment was a pivotal “Westworld” plot point, so of course the internet went nuts when fans realized the show had apparently used a Getty stock image of a random woman, rather than hire an actress to play the role of Juliet. The photographer credited for the photo is Erik von Weber, a name that sounds curiously like Arnold Weber (Jeffrey Wright), one of the characters on the show who helped create Westworld. Von Weber’s stock images have been used by a variety of websites, including HuffPost, so his involvement in the show didn’t immediately raise red flags. But when fans looked closer at von Weber’s Getty photos, they noticed some other notable pictures: images of horses, cowboys and, most interestingly, samurai, which are all subjects that have a connection to Westworld. Hmmm. Could von Weber have some secret ties to HBO?  Well, something fascinating just happened: In Season 2, Episode 2, titled “Reunion,” the woman from the Times Square stock photo made an appearance on the show. HuffPost reached out to the actress, Claire Unabia, to ask her about the experience of evolving from stock photo subject to “Westworld” actress, and she revealed an interesting detail: According to Unabia, the picture she posed for wasn’t originally meant to be a stock photo. “I’ll be honest with you, I don’t know if they got that photo that way, because that picture, as far as I know, wasn’t for a stock photo,” she said. “I don’t know if that’s actually the way that they got it. I’m not sure. I’ll just put it out there that maybe it wasn’t actually a stock photo.” Though she doesn’t remember all the specifics of the shoot in question, Unabia recalled it was for a job involving some sort of “technology company.”  “It was for a particular job. What I recall was for technology, [an] internal technology picture, so that’s what I recall taking it for.” Uh, “technology”? Claire, are you talking about Delos, the company running Westworld? The actress didn’t think the shoot, which she previously told HuffPost happened about four years before Season 1, was some big HBO conspiracy to take photos of potential “Westworld” stars, but she believes the showrunners “might have had other reasons when they chose the picture.” She is also suspicious about “Erik von Weber.” “I don’t recall that name at all,” said Unabia, adding, “Maybe the name is not the actual name.”  When reached for comment on von Weber’s possible connection to the show, HBO reps said they didn’t know if there was any information to share on the topic. We also contacted representatives at Getty Images, who said von Weber has refused all media requests. But if there is a connection between the photographer and the show, this opens up a wormhole of possibilities. Are the samurai photos on his account associated with the Delos park Shogun World? Do some of von Weber’s other photos hint at future show reveals, too? Most notably, von Weber’s photos include images of knights and people dressed up like barbarians. Maybe these are peeks into a medieval park world, which was in the original 1973 movie and is rumored to be appearing on the show. In addition to the conspiracy theory, Unabia talked to us about what it was like when HBO tracked her down and put her in the episode. So when did you really find out your picture was in the show? It was when [HuffPost’s Carly Ledbetter] reached out asking to talk to me about that and confirm it was me in the picture, and that’s when I found out. What was your reaction? I was very surprised. But it’s a kind of a thing where you feel like when you’re putting yourself out there in a way that somehow it will get picked up by the world, so in some way I wasn’t surprised. When did HBO contact you? It was after Season 1 finished. They had actually a slightly hard time getting in touch with me as well, and then it was a bit of back and forth with them. They asked me to do a scene and send it to them, and I didn’t hear anything for a while. Then they had some troubles with their shooting and script. They went through a lot of things, so their timeline was put off from what they thought it would’ve been previously. Then, they finally called me in to shoot as if I had known I was coming the whole time. Like, “OK, can you come two days from now or tomorrow?” What? So were you able to change your schedule? I did. I was working on some other job, but it was just going to be the last two days of it or something, so I just canceled the last two days and went out. What’s it like arriving in “Westworld”? It was a bit magical. You definitely feel like you’re stepping into another world when you arrive at the ranch. It looks a bit just like how it looks on the show, so you feel like you’ve stepped into that world, and I saw some of the set design. It’s crazy how some of it doesn’t feel like these psychotic crazy scary places, but then when I realize what it was, then I had that feeling like, “Oh my gosh. This is that place, and it looks like that place, and it looks like nothing right now, but it’s very scary.” Was anybody like, “Oh, you’re the person from the photo”? Yeah, somebody — another director — he came up to me, and he thought he knew me and was talking to me. “Oh, how are you?” and everything. And then it was minutes later that he said, “Oh, my gosh! You’re from the picture!” And he just realized it. So what was your character, Juliet, thinking when she saw Dolores? Oh, a world of terrible and suspicious things. [Laugh] That’s what it looked like. As a married person, you know, it’s when you have that look and understanding and kind of seeing your whole marriage or life in a way on the edge. It’s very upsetting. Especially in my house? This woman. She comes into my house? So do you have any theories about the show? My husband has a theory that I’m going to come back as a robot and kill the Dolores character and have a face off with her. But no, I don’t know anything. I’m not holding fast to any one theory or idea. So is it weird that Logan is carrying around a picture of his sister in the park? Yes, I do try to find reasons for that myself. I don’t know. Maybe because there was such excellent history with him and her and the park and his friend that it’s about something more than carrying a picture of your sister. What’s it like going from a photo to being on the show? That’s honestly the way that my life always is. Every year it’s some other new, crazy adventure, and I have no plans for it, and things just happened. One year I’m producing a show for a Fringe Festival in Scotland, and then the next year I’m doing something completely different, some acting thing, having kids. That’s the way we live our life. We’re in the art world and the film world. It’s very unpredictable. To read more of HuffPost’s “Westworld” coverage, head here. “Westworld” airs Sundays at 9 p.m. Eastern on HBO. "
BUSINESS,"We all know how it is. You procrastinated, and then you got busy. You forgot Aunt Sally was coming for Christmas. You pulled out the Hanukkah linens and they looked dingy. You realized that shovel just didn’t have another winter left in it. At these moments, near-instantaneous home delivery feels like a miracle. But customers’ convenience can quickly turn into workers’ misfortune.  Delivery services like the US Postal Service, UPS, and FedEx are hiring seasonal workers at a frantic pace, and retail giants like Amazon, Walmart, and Target are using courier contractors and experimenting with their own Uber-like on-demand delivery models to get packages the last mile to our homes. And still, logistics giants like UPS can’t keep up with the pace. The need to get our packages to us when we need—or want—them, has pushed the delivery model and its workers to the brink. There can be real dangers to delivering holiday joy: the US Department of Labor has found that temporary workers who are assigned to unfamiliar work with little training are several times more likely to get hurt on the job; Amazon delivery contractors have been sued for failing to pay the minimum wage; and drivers for Amazon’s on-demand delivery service, Flex, report they can be deactivated simply because oversized packages won’t fit in their cars. Imagine pushing a handcart of heavy packages along city streets because finding legal parking at all the residential addresses is impossible. (A 2006 investigation found that delivery drivers in New York City got an average of 7,000 parking tickets a day.) Consider what it means to have a GPS tracker reporting the time you wait for a left turn, and being asked to justify a bathroom break as a legitimate increase to your “Stops Per On-Road Hour.” Think about what you’d do if you were told 24 hours ahead of time you had to find child care to work a sixth day in the week because your bosses hadn’t planned on a holiday rush. Picture planning your own shopping list when you were promised $18 an hour, but can’t get more than an unpredictable few hours a day of work. Ponder a delivery route that includes 200 addresses spread out over 80 miles and a requirement to deliver to one address every two minutes. Santa’s reindeer have a cushy job in comparison. Crowdsourced delivery models like Walmart’s using Uber drivers, Amazon’s “Amazon Flex” and Target’s new logistics tech startup, threaten to bring the bad working conditions for Uber drivers into “last mile” delivery and right to our doorsteps: income uncertainty, drivers’ costs of maintaining and insuring the vehicle, and the fact that misclassification as independent contractors means laboring without workplace legal protections. In some locations, Walmart store employees clock out for the day, and then can get driving instructions from the company so that their commute home can turn into a delivery route. Even workers in good middle-class jobs at traditional delivery services are getting squeezed as their bosses compromise to stay on Amazon’s good side. In 2014, a deal between Amazon and the US Postal Service for Sunday delivery had some workers reporting 60 hour weeks and few days off.  To accommodate the increased workload, the USPS hired a new classification of workers who are paid less than permanent employees and are not eligible for the Postal Service’s career track. Rapid delivery of everything from a knitted vest for your company’s “Ugly Sweater Party” to cans of cranberry dressing can be a service that helps harried shoppers survive the holiday season. But we need to remember that those packages don’t appear by magic: real people deliver them, and under increasingly difficult circumstances. The season should deliver a decent holiday to the people who deliver yours."

By Jay Deshpande Busy times for Björk: Today the Icelandic artist unveiled the first publically available music video for her new album Vulnicura. The video for “Lionsong” shows Björk just how we’ve come to expect to see her from her many iconic visuals: singing in a spare and slightly futuristic setting, gesticulating wildly, and dressed to the nines. Directed by longtime collaborators Inez and Vinoodh, who also directed her surreal videos for “Hidden Place” and “Moon,” the clip shows Björk in a black bodysuit and colorful headdress that echo the cover of Vulnicura. Given the emotional honesty of the album, it’s fitting that we also see Björk’s heart repeatedly on display. According to the accompanying text on YouTube, visual effects were used not just to create the stars and lights surrounding the singer but also to “[extend] her legs to unnatural proportions.” “Lionsong” follows a video installation for “Black Lake” commissioned by MoMA, which for now can be seen only at their ongoing Björk exhibition."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Adele is rolling in deep with Rihanna. Time Magazine revealed its list of the 100 most influential people in the world on Thursday and this year, the “Anti” singer rightfully made the cut. (Sidenote: when has Rihanna not been one of the most influential people in the world?). Of course, the outlet thought it best to emotionally destroy music fans everywhere by having Adele profile the Fenty Beauty queen, whom she describes as “the most gracious, loyal and funny goofball of an icon.”  “I actually can’t remember the first time I met Rihanna; I was probably numb from the shock of it,” the British songstress wrote. “She is one year older than me, but I feel like she’s been around forever. The progression of her superstardom feels steady, well deserved and extremely natural.” Adele goes on to declare that ever since the hit song “Umbrella,” Rih Rih has forever changed the game and that no one will ever “get away with copying” her. For the record, she also has the very right opinion that Rihanna’s breakout single “Pon de Replay” is an “absolute banger.” Rihanna “makes her own rules and bends ours,” she added.  While it’s unclear just how close the two are, we know they met and posed for photos together at the 2013 Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. And Adele’s adoration of her fellow singer was well documented before the Time article; in a 2015 Rolling Stone story, she called Rihanna “life itself.” In her Time piece, Adele says Rihanna “glows like when someone’s taken a picture with a flash and you’re dazed for a few minutes after. But it’s also very clear in that glow that she genuinely doesn’t give a f-ck; she’s fearless and full of all the right kind of attitude to be everything that she is and will be forever.” Sounds about right.  To read the full profile, head over to Time."
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump used an event that honored fallen law enforcement officers on Tuesday to rail against sanctuary cities and the MS-13 gang as he called for the death penalty for those who kill police officers. “We’re calling on Congress to secure our borders, support our border agents, stop sanctuary cities and shutdown policies that release violent criminals back into our communities,” Trump said during a speech in conjunction with National Police Week, an annual event that convenes in the nation’s capital. “We are the ones who are taking back the streets. We are getting them out of our country by the thousands. Every week we’re setting new records,” Trump said, referring to immigrant members of MS-13. “We’re getting them out or we’re putting them in prison.” Trump also took aim at criticism of law enforcement and called for respect for police officers. “We must stand up for our police, we must confront and condemn dangerous anti-police prejudice. Can you believe this prejudice with respect to our police?” Trump said. “We’re not going to let bad things happen to our police.” “We believe criminals who kill our police should get the death penalty, bring it forth,” he added. Amid remarks recognizing fallen officers and their families, Trump also touted his administration’s decision to reverse Obama-era limits that prevented police departments from acquiring particular types of military equipment. Now, Trump said, police were grabbing up free surplus military equipment “at a record clip.” Chuck Canterbury, the president of the national Fraternal Order of Police, introduced Trump to the audience. He called on Congress to pass a law that would create new federal penalties for those who killed officers. Civil rights groups have opposed the legislation, saying the “superfluous” legislation promotes the “untrue... unhelpful and dangerous” narrative that there’s a “war on police” and “will have a negative impact on the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve.” “We are targeted by scorn, by disrespect, and by all too often violence. We have come to learn that we cannot always count on elected leadership in our country to have our back,” Canterbury said before praising Trump. In a speech to the National Association of Police Organizations on Monday night, Attorney General Jeff Sessions also highlighted the Justice Department’s retreat from broader investigations of police departments that were conducted more routinely during the Obama administration. “By the end of the previous administration many of you came to believe that some of the political leadership of this country had abandoned you,” Sessions said, blaming “radicals and politicians” who are critical of policing as the problem. “This is the Trump era. We support law enforcement,” Sessions said. ”Of course, we will continue to hold accountable any officer who violates the law and undermines the good work of our police. But we will not malign entire police departments. We will not try to micromanage their daily work all the way from Washington, D.C. We will not enter into agreements or court decrees that outsource policymaking to political activists.” Sherrilyn Ifill, the head of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, called on Congress to step up oversight efforts in response to Sessions’ comments. “Eschewing legal requirements and permitting systemic constitutional violations to go unaddressed is the opposite of what our communities need from the nation’s top cop,” she said. “The Justice Department has a unique responsibility to enforce the law enforcement misconduct statute, and our elected officials should stop the Department from shirking its obligations. If the Attorney General and Congress are serious about increasing officer safety, they should double down on policing reform efforts, not abandon them.” Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

POLITICS,"The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will have his salary reduced following scrutiny over his $375,000 pay, which is nearly double what his predecessor earned. Dr. Robert Redfield, who was selected to lead the agency in March, made the request after media outlets reported on his salary last week, prompting criticism from Senate Democrats and watchdog groups. A government spokesperson confirmed the pay reduction to HuffPost on Tuesday but declined to say what Redfield’s new salary will be. Redfield, who was a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the co-founder of the university’s Institute of Human Virology before joining the CDC, reportedly asked Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar for the pay reduction. “Dr. Redfield has expressed to Secretary Azar that he does not wish to have his compensation become a distraction for the important work of the CDC,” an HHS official told HuffPost in an email. “Therefore, consistent with Dr. Redfield’s request to the Secretary, Dr. Redfield’s compensation will be adjusted accordingly,” the official said. In comparison, Azar, Redfield’s boss, earns $199,700 a year ― a figure that is set by law. Redfield’s predecessor, Brenda Fitzgerald, earned $197,000, The Washington Post reported. Redfield benefited from a provision known as Title 42, which gives federal agencies the ability to offer higher-paying salaries when trying to fill specific scientific positions that the agencies are otherwise struggling to fill, according to The New York Times. Sen. Patty Murray (Wash), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, was among those questioning Redfield’s lucrative pay and why he benefited from the special provision. “It is difficult to understand why someone with limited public health experience, particularly in a leadership role, is being disproportionately compensated for his work as compared to other accomplished scientists and public health leaders in comparable roles within the federal government,” Murray stated in a letter sent to Azar on Friday. Murray asked that the HHS explain its reasoning for applying Title 42, and asked for evidence that the agency employed “extensive and exhaustive” search efforts in finding a CDC director before resorting to the use of the provision. HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley defended Redfield’s hiring in a statement sent to HuffPost that said it had utilized “a rare opportunity to hire one of the world’s leading virologists.” “Dr. Redfield has over 30 years of experience as a groundbreaking scientist, academic researcher, and clinician who has been a global leader in the fight against one of the most devastating infectious diseases of our time — HIV/AIDS,” Oakley said in the statement. “The selection of Dr. Redfield was the right choice at the right time for the right purpose. Dr. Redfield is someone who understands this work from all of these perspectives and has firsthand knowledge of what researchers and practitioners need to keep the American people safe at home and abroad.”"
ENTERTAINMENT,"Bill Cosby’s sexual assault retrial ended Thursday with his conviction on three counts of aggravated indecent assault. This has been a long time coming for the victim in this case, Andrea Constand, who said the comedian, now 80, assaulted her 14 years ago, and a small victory for the many other women who claim they were also drugged and victimized by Cosby as far back as the 1960s. Cosby’s victimizing went on for decades — in his own deposition testimony, he admitted to giving quaaludes to women he wanted to have sex with in the ’70s. It wasn’t until October 2014 that this whole thing really blew up, and it was — of all people — another comedian, Hannibal Buress, who got it going. That’s when the former “Saturday Night Live” and “30 Rock” writer and actor (“Neighbors,” “Broad City”) called out Cosby during a standup show. “Bill Cosby has the f**king smuggest old black man public persona that I hate,” Buress said. “‘Pull your pants up, black people. I was on TV in the ’80s. I can talk down to you because I had a successful sitcom.’ Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby. So, brings you down a couple notches. I don’t curse onstage. But yeah, you’re a rapist.” Buress’s comedy bit about Cosby from 2014: Buress continued, “I want to just at least make it weird for you to watch ‘Cosby Show’ reruns. If you don’t know about it, trust me. When you leave here, Google ‘Bill Cosby rape.’ That s*** has more results than ‘Hannibal Buress.’” Footage of his act went viral, and people finally stopped to really consider what had been a well-circulated rumor in the entertainment industry. It took on a life outside of social media with news organizations starting to report on it, including CBS News with “Who is Hannibal Buress, and why did he call Bill Cosby a ‘rapist’?” a month later. More important, brave women started speaking out — and didn’t stop. So many women — dozens — accused him of the same thing. Soon, Cosby, who had a family comedy in the works, lost that show amid the widespread backlash, (finally) pulled the plug on his own comedy tour, and soon found himself at the center of legal action. Constand’s is the only criminal case so far, but other accusers have filed civil suits. He also filed civil suits of his own. While the accusations against Harvey Weinstein last year are credited for birthing the #MeToo movement, the women accusing Cosby had their own even before that. Five of Cosby’s other accusers testified against him in this retrial — including model and TV personality Janice Dickinson, who is perhaps the best known of the bunch — which took place less than a year after another jury deadlocked on the charges. Buress spoke about being pulled into the Cosby narrative in 2015. “You can’t predict s*** like that,” he told GQ. When the interviewer brought up his being a “feminist hero,” he replied, “People are going to put on you whatever they want to put on you. It is conflicting, because people think I’m like this amazing guy or something. I’m a decent guy.” Not everything about it was good. A special he was doing with Comedy Central was delayed due to the controversy, but the show went on to air soon after. In 2016, during a Netflix panel discussion, Buress said it was a weird surprise that his joke had had such an impact. “I was doing a joke in my show, and that shouldn’t influence public opinion. I don’t know if it should go that far. It’s weird to me that a joke did that.” He also noted that there was more to his routine than Cosby jokes. “I do a lot of other s***,” he said. “It’s weird that it happened like that. I was calling a bunch of other comedians rapists, and that was the only one people took seriously. That’s just one joke people took and really ran with it.” Buress has gone on to have more success in recent years, but fellow comedian Patton Oswalt said Cosby had nothing to do with it. “Hannibal was doing fine without that [Cosby controversy],” he said at the same panel. “He’d be sitting here now if that had not happened. … That’s just incidental to where he was going anyway.”While Buress’s act isn’t focused on Cosby jokes, he did crack another one that got some headlines in 2015. At Justin Bieber’s 2015 Comedy Central roast, he said, “I hate your music more than Bill Cosby hates my comedy.”Buress hasn’t yet spoken out about Cosby’s conviction, for which the disgraced comedian faces up to 10 years in prison for each of the three counts, despite Yahoo’s request for comment via his legal rep. Seems likely he’s saving it for his standup. Read more from Yahoo Entertainment: This post was originally published on Yahoo Entertainment. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"When Annie Clark, aka St. Vincent, announced the release of her guitar design collaboration with Ernie Ball manufacturers on Instagram in mid-2015, she described it as “a tool that would be ergonomic, lightweight, and sleek.” The angular aesthetic of her design is getting an update for 2017, with a new set of colors: Tobacco Burst, Heritage Red, Stealth Black and Polaris White — the latter of which she’s nicknamed “the thin white duke,” the same moniker given to David Bowie. “Bowie’s like air. People just need Bowie to live,” she told The Huffington Post. Discussing her visual aims for the guitar, Clark continued, “I was going for a kind of retro-future aesthetic. I’m very fond of the Memphis school of design, and I’m fond of angularity in design. So I was going for that, rather than round shapes.” The guitar features an African mahogany body, with a hand-rubbed rosewood neck and St. Vincent inlays — the two intersecting circles that represent the “S” in her logo.  She’s seen photos of her Ernie Ball guitar in action. “One of my favorite guitar players — Omar [Rodríguez-López] from The Mars Volta and At the Drive-In — is playing a white one, left-handed. I couldn’t say enough good things about his guitar playing. I’m thrilled that he likes it.” The instrument, Clark is clear, is an “equal-opportunity guitar,” even if the press latched on to her comment in 2015 that the design left “room for a breast. Or two,” hailing it as a boon for female guitarists. And while the design is lightweight and sleek, there’s no gender attached to it. “I was making a joke,” she explained. “The guitar is equal-opportunity. It’s a really comfortable guitar no matter your body size or shape, but including if you are small, or if you do have breasts — men have breasts.” “It’s an incredibly versatile guitar and I designed it with my own experience in mind,” she later added. She explained that the instrument is meant to be versatile, “both tone-wise and ergonomically,” for anyone who picks it up. She brings up a fair point, on the heels of a press round for her directorial debut in the horror anthology “XX.” Clark said she was asked about the experience of being a woman, specifically, in film — a line of questioning she’s answered ad infinitum as a musician. “I’ve spent a lot of time in my career side-stepping and unpacking the question of what’s it like to be a woman in music,” Clark said. Later, she added, “I will say that no one has ever asked a guy in film or [music] what its like to be a guy in [film or] music. I think, personally, I would rather talk about the ins and outs and the specificity of the craft and ideas than spend any more time with this particular question.” In this case, she’d rather talk about her guitar — and the fact that it’s accessible to a range of musicians. “I think the idea is to make a great tool for artists and to make a great tool that is friendly to play whether you’re just starting out or whether you’ve been playing for 30 years or more,” Clark said. And for those just starting out in the music world, Clark has this advice: “I just think it’s really important to know all aspects of your craft ... Find out what you can about engineering, and learn about frequencies, and be able to be the engineer or speak to engineers live and in studio. And just make things that you like. Not things that you think other people might like, but things that you like. And things that matter to you.”"

Because of artistic differences, however, between Gold and artistic director Jeffrey Horowitz, the show was pulled in June 2016.  Now, the play, having controversially switched venues and artistic directors, is officially back on the docket. And we could picture few people better than Mr. Llewyn Davis himself to play the brooding, emo lead.  Oh, and one more bonus: Horatio will be played by Keegan-Michael Key, of “Key and Peele,” in his first New York stage performance. According to Slate, however, Key was classically trained as a Shakespearean actor before veering into improv comedy, so our expectations are pretty high.  Tickets will go on sale for Public members on March 9, with non-member tickets available at an unspecified later date.

ARTS & CULTURE,"The numbers don’t lie: James Patterson loves clichés. He deploys 160 for every 100,000 words he publishes. Yikes! In a new book, Nabokov’s Favorite Word Is Mauve, statistician Ben Blatt runs the numbers on bestselling and classic literature, coming to some startling ― and not-so-startling ― conclusions. In a Publishers Weekly article, Blatt shared a few of the stats from his book, revealing the most, and least, cliché-prone, exclamation-point-heavy, and weather-obsessed authors. “If you have a body of literature, stats can now serve as an x-ray,” he writes. Some of the revelations are hardly surprising. Patterson, who has his name on over 200 novels, many of them bestsellers, isn’t known for his innovative prose. After crosschecking 50 classic and bestselling authors against Christine Ammer’s The Dictionary of Clichés, Blatt found that the crime writer took top prize for most clichés. Certain literary writers known for pushing the style envelope weren’t far behind, however. Kurt Vonnegut, James Joyce (rather surprisingly), and Zadie Smith also deployed well over 100 clichés per 100,000 words. On the low end: Virginia Woolf, Veronica Roth, and Khaled Hosseini.   What about exclamation points? Noir novelist Elmore Leonard hates ‘em (49 per 100,000 words) and James Joyce loves ‘em (1105 per 100,000 words). Interestingly, male writers populate the extremes of Blatt’s body of authors, when it comes to exclamation points. The top users include Tom Wolfe, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Sinclair Lewis, while the bottom users include Ernest Hemingway, John Updike, and Chuck Palahniuk.  Blatt also analyzed how often authors open their books with descriptions of the weather, a scene-setting tactic that, he points out, was slammed by spare stylist Leonard. “The reader is apt to leaf ahead looking for people,” Leonard argued in a 2001 New York Times column. While some authors, like Toni Morrison and Ernest Hemingway, never mention weather in the first sentence, Blatt found that John Steinbeck and Willa Cather both did so about a quarter of the time. And then there’s the all-time champ: “Danielle Steel, known for selling hundreds of millions of books, should also be known for talking about the weather,” he writes. “Nearly half her of introductions involve weather.” These stats might not tell us anything particularly world-shaking about the authors we love, but there’s an inherent fascination about seeing the habits and stylistic patterns of great writers broken down into precise parts. Frankly, we just can’t get enough of it. Check out graphics and more stats from Blatt on Publishers Weekly. "
ENTERTAINMENT,"For some reason, “Arrested Development” creator Mitch Hurwitz has remixed the fourth season of his own show, ahead of the much-anticipated debut of Season 5, and on Tuesday he tweeted its imminent release. “Arrested Development Season 4 Remix: Fateful Consequences” will present the events of that season in chronological order on Netflix beginning Friday, May 4 ― which also happens to be a Bluth universe holiday known as Cinco de Cuatro. In his lengthy message to fans, Hurwitz noted that the show had followed a nontraditional format throughout Season 4, to some viewers’ frustrations. Many of the original cast members were not able to film together for the 2013 season due to scheduling conflicts, and so episodes focused on individual characters and jumped forward and backward in time. It was, Hurwitz wrote, “in some ways to be an experience for that viewer, perhaps, akin to eating some toast, then some bacon ― maybe a sliced tomato followed by some turkey and realizing ‘Hey I think I just had a BLT.’” (He later changed that to “Hey I think I just had a club sandwich,” after a reader pointed out what happens to a BLT when you add turkey.)  At times during Season 4, producers relied on green screens to artificially insert actors into scenes ― which some viewers found awkward.  Hurwitz’s announcement comes about three-and-a-half years after he first mentioned his odd recutting project ― and hopefully does not signal how long it took him to accomplish the feat. Although he tweeted that Season 5 will drop “soon” ― “[l]ike really soon” ― Hurwitz neglected to mention precisely when to expect it. In the remix, the series creator shuffled footage “from 15 individualized stories into 22 interwoven stories the length of the original series.” He said he pursued it not only as a blatant cash grab but “as a comedic experiment to see if new jokes and a new perspective would emerge from a remix that features all the Bluths in every episode. ... And I’m really excited about the final result.” On the next...

ENTERTAINMENT,"Marvel Comics icon Stan Lee is being sued by Chicago-based massage therapist Maria Carballo for allegedly sexually harassing and grabbing her during two massage appointments last year.  Carballo’s complaint, filed Monday in Cook County circuit court, names Lee and his assistant Mac “Max” Anderson, who arranged the massage appointments. The complaint lists charges including assault, battery and emotional stress, and Carballo is seeking over $50,000 in damages, according to documents obtained by People. Lee, 95, denied the allegations through his attorney Jonathan Freund, who told the Chicago Tribune that his client was shocked by the allegations.  “He is a high-profile public figure and I think it’s a shakedown,” Freund told the Chicago Tribune. “The guy is 95, I don’t think he would do that.” Neither Lee or his attorney immediately responded to HuffPost’s request for comment.  According to the lawsuit, Lee hired Carballo to perform a two-hour massage on April 21, 2017, at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Chicago while Lee was in town for an annual comic expo called C2E2. About a half hour into the massage, Carballo alleges that Lee “began to fondle himself” while he was face down on the table. Later in the appointment, Lee allegedly began moaning as Carballo massaged his legs. Carballo immediately became uncomfortable and ended the massage, the suit says. The next day, Carballo says, her boss called her asking that she massage Lee again. She initially refused, but her boss pressed the issue by apologizing for Lee’s behavior and reiterating the importance of “appeasing VIP clients,” according to the complaint. Eventually, Carballo acquiesced because she was afraid she would lose her job, she says. An hour into the massage on April 22, 2017, Carballo claims Lee began moaning again, at which time she attempted to end the massage. According to the complaint, Lee stood up, naked and angry, and demanded that Carballo continue the massage. She says she agreed to 10 more minutes, fearing what he would do if she did not continue. Carballo switched to a shiatsu massage method, which uses only the masseur’s feet, in order to keep her distance, the Chicago Tribune reports. According to the lawsuit, “Lee grabbed [Carballo’s] foot and moved it against his penis and scrotum.” Carballo says she immediately ended the massage, collected $240 for the appointment and left. Before she got on the elevator, Lee’s assistant allegedly gave her a big tip in cash.  She did not report the incident because she was “fearful that, in light of Lee’s wealth and status, reporting the incident to police would hurt her job,” the lawsuit states.  “For a long time, I was afraid to ask anyone to help me hold Mr. Lee accountable for how he treated me. He is rich and famous. I am not,” Carballo said in a statement provided to Page Six. “After seeing other women fight to be treated with dignity and respect, I decided, me too. I am still nervous and afraid, but not as much as I was before because I have other people helping me.” Lee’s business partner, Keya Morgan, told TMZ that Lee is “completely harmless” and “100 percent innocent.”  In January, the Daily Mail reported claims from an unnamed source who alleged that Lee sexually harassed and groped multiple female home health nurses. Lee’s attorney at the time, Tom Lalla, denied all accusations against his client. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Okuwi Enwezo, the director of the Venice Biennale has chosen Italian artist Fabio Mauri as the central artist around which the universal exhibition's curatorial program is going to coalesce later this year. This choice is both timely and excellent due to the fact that Mauri, as an artist, problematized the way humanity deals with political violence at the level of the individual. His conceptualism achieves somethings apparently impossible which is to be experienced at an emotional level. The way, however, his work has been read till now, insists on transforming his pieces into a visual representation of some aspects of continental social philosophy.   A year ago, a retrospective was dedicated to him at the Fundación PROA in my hometown, Buenos Aires where many of the works that will be shown in Venice were included. Three of them are of particular interest. The first one is a performance piece called ""Ebrea (Jewess)"" from 1971 where a nude young woman is included standing in front of a mirror. For the duration of the piece, the woman cuts off locks of her hair, pasting them in the shape of a Star of David onto the mirror. I don't think it is necessary for me to point out the link to the haircuts given to Auschwitz prisoners on the way to the gas chambers, with simulated hideous objects, such as soap made from corpses and a horse harness fabricated from human skin. Ironically, Nicola Costantino, the artist chosen by the Argentinians to represent them at the Biennale 2013 gained notoriety after producing soap made of human fat sourced from cosmetic surgery. Although the links to Nazi practices were also obvious there, the fact that last year she presented in Venice an installation dedicated to no other than Eva Perón, wife of the Argentine dictator who allegedly financed his presidential campaign allowing Nazis to find exile in Argentina, comes across as ironic. There is a difference, however, between Mauri's and Costantino's performance. While the former aims at creating a psychological environment where horror becomes seductive and, thus, a source of shame, the latter goes a bit too far by glamorizing that horror.   Another of the pieces presented in Venice will be ""Evil Numbers"", a nonsensical mathematical formula written on a blackboard facing a large photomural of Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, at the ""degenerate art"" exhibition at the Haus der Kunst in Munich in 1937. Describing these works by Mauri, Enwezor, who is also the current director of the Haus der Kunst is absolutely right when saying: ""They are not like visual events but more like psychological events'.  When I was a child, a man followed me on my way to a school football practice and while on the bus, he approached me, grabbed my hand and rubbed it against his crotch. Even though I ran to the lavatories to wash my hands upon arrival to school, I found myself fantasizing with that moment many times ever since and, in a way, has defined my relationship with gay sex.  Similarly, a friend of mine who was raped, told me once that he sometimes goes through the same kind of shamefully erotic feelings. It is like an inverted Stockholm Syndrome that focuses on the feeling instead of the perpetrator. I think that it is precisely that psychological cornice that Mauri's performances invite us to walk. The viewer is immediately forced to participate in actions that are both seductive and shameful maybe that is why Mauri used to say that during his childhood 'even the sun was fascist'.  The decision of the curator of the Venice Biennale to focus on this psychological exploration comes at a time when all the readings of his work have seemed to  focus on the way he explored the impossibility of representation after the Holocaust. This is, of course, true but it does not exhaust the possibilities that his works (as art) brings about. An example of this is the informed way in which the Italian curator of the Buenos Aires show, Ivan Barlafante referred to his series of 48 screens hung on a wall in a minimalist fashion, as the result of reducing representation to its minimum transforming them into a mere objects. In Barlafante's attempt to canonize Mauri as a post-war humanist who discussed representation itself as a possibility after the Holocaust, he ends up forgetting about the viewer's experience and, most of all, of his feelings. It is in the paradoxical vicious circle of erotic attraction and humanistic shame that Mauri's response to American Pop Art should be inscribed. His discussion of the role of the media in today's society is not concerned with representation as such (as technical reproduction or serialization) but with the seduction that self harm has in all of us once modernity's optimism is over.

POLITICS,"The FBI and the Department of Justice are investigating Cambridge Analytica, the now-defunct data firm involved in a massive data breach in March, The New York Times reported Tuesday. News of the investigation comes roughly two months after the London-based company was accused of secretly harvesting the personal data of at least 87 million Facebook users to better identify individuals that could be targeted and influenced by specific marketing material.  Federal investigators have reportedly questioned potential witnesses, including former employees and banks that conducted business with the company, a U.S. official and other people familiar with the probe told the Times.  The DOJ declined to comment, while the FBI did not immediately respond to a query. The United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency is conducting its own investigation into whether the firm violated the country’s Data Protection Act, the Times reported. The agency is looking into allegations that Cambridge Analytica employees may have sought to bribe foreign officials, tampered with evidence and hacked computers. Cambridge Analytica announced earlier in May that it planned to close all of its operations and file for bankruptcy in the United States, reportedly as a result of rising legal fees and a loss of clients after it was outed for harvesting Facebook users’ data. In a statement on its website, the firm said it has been the subject of “numerous unfounded accusations” and “vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.” Shortly after news of the breach surfaced, the firm announced an independent investigation into its practices. The results of that investigation, which were shared on the company’s website, stated that the allegations against the firm were not “borne out by the facts. When asked for comment on the DOJ investigation, a Cambridge Analytica press representative sent HuffPost a copy of the company’s internal probe. Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign hired Cambridge Analytica but the company has denied that it used data acquired through Facebook to assist Trump’s efforts to win the election. Secret recordings of Cambridge Analytica executives appeared to capture them bragging about helping elect Trump by using “unattributable and untraceable” advertising and attack ads, according to an undercover report by British news station Channel 4. Facebook first learned in 2015 that Cambridge Analytica was harvesting users’ data but failed to follow up after the firm allegedly promised to delete the information, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, said in April. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has since apologized for not doing more to protect users’ data and vowed to increase privacy and security standards. Zuckerberg also testified before Senate and House committees to answer questions about Facebook users’ data protections."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Artist David Mesguich is deeply proud of his latest work. “It is projects like this which upset the sense of fatality!” he exclaims. His pride stems from the extraordinary nature of his project: instead of a gallery or museum, Mesguich has been working to beautify one of France’s harshest prisons. Last February, Mesguich worked with prison inmates who were receiving medical and psychological treatment to paint two immense murals against backdrops of gray cement and barbed wire. His goal, he says, was, “to show the prisoners... that beautiful and positive things can still come from inside them.”  Marseilles’ Baumettes prison is one of the most notorious in France. Earlier this year a scandal erupted when inmates posted images of themselves on Facebook posing with money, drugs and weapons. The proliferation of forbidden goods and weapons among prisoners highlighted Baumettes’ critical shortage of staffers.  In 2012, then-French Prison Inspector General Jean-Marie Delarue denounced Baumettes' prison conditions in a damning report, referring to them as “inhuman” and citing severe overcrowding, vermin infestations, building decay and high rates of violence between inmates. For Mesguich, working in this prison was a deeply personal project. “I encountered the prison world very early on, due to a rough upbringing,” he says. “As a young boy, I visited a number of prisons, and, as an adolescent, I knew of Baumettes, where my father was incarcerated. So, since childhood, I have reflected on isolation and separation.”  This reflection led him to the idea of a “monumental” project: two murals, each over six-feet high, painted by six prisoners in the complicated conditions that accompany incarceration.  “It was not simple to put this in place, because the constraints of the prison environment determine the way the work can happen,” Mesguich explained. “For example, I did not have the right to use a ladder to reach the top of the mural when the prisoners and the nurses were with me. And time for work on the mural was limited to two hours for the prisoners. So I came back during off-hours, between noon and two, and continued alone at the site with the ladder. The rest of the time, I waited in a room while the time passed.”

 Working in a prison was a deep calling for Mesguich, who has frequently taken his artwork to the streets. But his work also poses the question of the real benefit this type of project might have for inmates. Sociologist Jean Bérard, a professor at the University of Montreal, has worked on the history of French prison reform. According to him, “It is difficult to respond on behalf of [the prisoners] about what such an initiative can bring to them. But the limits of such initiatives are known: they involve a minority of prisoners, and cannot radically transform the way an institution of imprisonment operates.” For Didier Fassin, sociologist and author of The Shadow Of The World: An Anthropology Of The Penal Condition, the initiative is compelling -- although difficult to assess without commentary from the inmates. “It transforms the prison space, and brightens it, while emphasizing by contrast the ugly and oppressive character of the metal gates, the barbed wire, and the walls,” he says. “This being the case, the question is more general, as is the case with cities. Making murals in a city does not change its reality.” But what is essential for Mesguich is the fact that “these creations bring humanity to a place where it is lacking.” He did not wish for the inmates to serve as the manpower for the realization of his project. What he wanted was for them to participate at his side in the creation of a shared work. And so the murals bear his signature, but also those of the prisoners who worked on them: Marco, Noël, Momo, Jeoffrey and Michel.

BUSINESS,"Chobani filed a lawsuit this week against conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, accusing the right-wing radio host and his site, Infowars, of posting a fake news story linking the company and its CEO, Hamdi Ulukaya, to a 2014 sexual assault case involving refugees.  Ulukaya has long been the target of xenophobic threats and right-wing attacks over business practices that earned him and his company admiration all over the world. In addition to supporting charities that aid refugees and immigration, Ulukaya made it a point early in the company’s history to hire refugees and individuals who had been laid off. “If a refugee has a job, they are no longer a refugee,” Ulukaya, himself a Turkish immigrant of Kurdish descent, told The Financial Times last year. Earlier this month, Chobani argued that Infowars published a falsified report about a sexual assault case in Twin Falls, Idaho, where Chobani owns and operates the largest yogurt plant in the world. The lawsuit says the erroneous report linked Ulukaya to the assault case and accused his company of bringing “crime and tuberculosis to the community.” The fake news stories led to a customer boycott call against Chobani products, the suit says. The article, which carries the headline “MSM [Mainstream Media] Covers For Globalist’s Refugee Import Program After Child Rape Case” has received more than 22,000 views on YouTube, and Jones tweeted the story to his roughly 600,000 Twitter followers. The lawsuit says the story was also given a different headline, “Idaho Yogurt Maker Caught Importing Migrant Rapists,” when it was tweeted by Infowars. “Defendant Alex Jones is no stranger to spurious statements,” the lawsuit states. “The Southern Poverty Law Center described Mr. Jones as ‘almost certainly the most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary America.’ Mr. Jones has now taken aim at Chobani and the Twin Falls community.” Click here to read the lawsuit, filed in Idaho District Court, in its entirety.  "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Canada, once again, does it better. Not only is our neighbor to the North able to offer free healthcare and create a tolerant atmosphere towards diversity, but it also has tricks up its sleeves when it comes to its smaller cities. I’ve had a chance to visit Winnipeg, Manitoba on a recent visit to Canada. This trip has reminded me that great discoveries and amazing experiences can be found anywhere—if only we are willing to look. “Your assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won’t come in.” - Isaac Asimov Tucked away in the southeast corner of the vast Manitoba province, Winnipeg is an easy two and a half hour flight from Chicago. Upon landing, a laid back, traffic jam-free version of Chicago awaits. Indeed, Winnipeg has been called “Chicago of the North” during its boom of the late nineteenth—early twentieth century. People have lived here for millennia, attracted to the favorable location on the intersection of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. The battle ground for the fierce fur trading battles of the Hudson Bay Company fame, Winnipeg became Canada’s third-largest city and a major railway transportation center by the turn of the century. As railways slowly lost importance in the twentieth century, the glory of Winnipeg disappeared with them. Today, a quiet resurgence of a different kind is brewing. In the last year alone, half a dozen new breweries have opened in the city of seven hundred thousand residents. Indeed, Winnipeg is one of the latest places to undergo the craft beer revolution as its laws have turned in favor of craft producers in 2016. Now, it is entirely within reach to stop by a brewery such as Little Brown Jug while strolling through downtown Winnipeg. The open concept craft brewer welcomes customers to come in and enjoy a pint or two while observing the end-to-end beer making process. This creative upsurge is sweeping across the city. A sure win for the Winnipeg’s creative community, recently launched Design Quarter is a curated destination experience and a collective of local businesses that aims to promote authentic retail and design focused culture. Created and led by Johanna Hurme, a Finnish-born architect who now calls Winnipeg home, the Design Quarter makes it easier for visitors to find unique food, design, and shopping opportunities that are sure to inspire.  One of the spots on the Design Quarter map is Forth. A cafe, a craft cocktail bar, a rooftop music venue, and a community meeting space, Forth is a great example of what Winnipeg’s creative spirit stands for: supporting each other is at the forefront of the city’s creative community. Another spot on the Design District map that shouldn’t be missed is the Lennard Taylor Design Studio, loved locally and recognized globally for its fashion-forward, detail-oriented pieces that don’t fit a particular mold. Pop in the open concept studio at any given moment and you’re sure to see the soccer-hopeful turned fashion designer and artist himself sitting behind his sewing machine or putting finishing touches on his latest painting, always with a smile.  Fashion designers, jewelry artists, coffee roasters, painters, book purveyors, fine leather craftsmen, and more—this is Winnipeg. If a tight-knit community is one way to describe it, open concept would be another. As if borrowing from the vast swaths of prairies that surround the city, Winnipeggers exchange ideas as easily as they share food on their table, welcome people, and converge on a common goal of growing their city together.  If encountering a passionate community of creative minds isn’t compelling enough, there is an opportunity to experience Winnipeg—and with it, a glimpse of humanity—in a different way. The Canadian Museum of Human Rights is a first museum of its kind dedicated to a concept, not artifacts. Thought-provoking exhibitions about the Holocaust, the plight of the First Nations, the Ukrainian Holodomor, and more educate and invite reflection on human nature and on what it means to have a shared future. It’s a delicate balance to present such difficult topics with dignity, poignancy and compassion. The museum maintains it expertly.  The thoughtful design of the museum was conceived by Antoine Predock. The New Mexico-based architect aims to show, through structures, how human beings can interact spiritually with a building, with technology, with the natural environment and with each other. The architecture with odd angles and contradicting lines continues to stun throughout the visit and represents the idea that the path to equal human rights is not straightforward. Winnipeg may have been called Chicago of the North in the past, but today the city is coming into its own. Because of places like the unassuming Clementine Cafe (you’ll discover a whole new world by trying its yogurt panna cotta with nectarines), Winnipeg easily competes with such culinary heavyweights  as Chicago and New York, while award-winning architects, musicians, artists, and fashion designers choose to create here, with passion.  This spirit is contagious.

POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― It’s been hard to miss Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.), the bombastic first-term congresswoman whose penchant for making controversial statements has drawn comparisons to President Donald Trump and former Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.).  The New York Republican drew a firestorm of criticism when, in the wake of the Parkland school shooting, she claimed that many people who commit mass murders “end up being Democrats.” She later blamed the “twist and smear” media for ginning up controversy over her remark, calling the press the “single biggest destructive force in our country.” After a number of Democrats chose not to stand and clap during portions of the president’s State of the Union address earlier this year, she claimed they didn’t “love our country.” And she has blamed the “deep state” over a $31,000 dining set bought for Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson’s office. Tenney’s confrontational style stands in stark contrast to her Democratic challenger, New York state Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi. The 39-year-old lawmaker from Utica has largely flown under the radar in the national media despite announcing his campaign a nearly a year ago. He has preferred to keep a low profile, focusing instead on his district, which covers the small upstate cities of Rome and Utica. Last week, for example, he launched a decidedly anodyne petition calling for an investigation into internet rate hikes by a New York cable provider.  “Folks back home don’t want our community to make national news because of the controversial things that our representative says,” Brindisi told HuffPost on Thursday. “They want a representative who’s going to fight to get them better health care, who’s going to provide middle-class tax cuts, and who is going to stand up to corporate special interests that are driving the conversation in Washington.” Brindisi’s approach appears to be working ― at least for the moment. He has led in several recent polls of the race. Moreover, he has outraised his GOP opponent ever since he entered the contest in June ― an unusual feat for a candidate who is taking on an incumbent. In the first quarter of 2018, Brindisi hauled in over $450,000 in contributions compared to just $258,000 for Tenney. His campaign currently also has about $200,000 more in cash on hand. “It’s somewhat unexpected. Everybody thought it’d be a close race. To have him in the lead right now is pretty remarkable,” said Luke Perry, a professor of politics and government at Utica College. While Brindisi has beat expectations, it’s still too early to tell whether he can succeed in ousting an incumbent in what has traditionally been a GOP district. Though a moderate, he has received backing from labor and education groups, as well as the Democratic establishment in the state. He’s liked by his colleagues in Albany and is well-known in northern portions of the congressional district. And he is likely to benefit from what many observers see as a coming blue wave in November. But the race for New York’s 22nd Congressional District is expected to be one of the most competitive in the nation, and likely the top battleground in New York state. National Republicans and their allies will likely spend heavily to defend the seat. Brindisi, meanwhile, has run unopposed in his assembly district since 2011.  Tenney and the National Republican Congressional Committee have already sought to cast Brindisi as a liberal, describing him as a “socialist” who is beholden to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Moreover, Brindisi’s name recognition may be a problem in some areas of the district. About 65 percent of voters said in a recent Democratic poll that they did not know enough about the candidate yet to form an opinion of him. “He’s got to try to convince constituents he’s a moderate when he’s being cast as the opposite. He’s gotta be careful not go too negative,” Perry said. Pelosi’s long-awaited public announcement earlier this week that she will run for House speaker if Democrats win a majority this fall generated gleeful cheers among Republicans in Washington. The GOP has successfully used the California Democrat’s image and progressive politics to bash Democratic candidates in swing districts in prior contests. To that end, Tenney questioned this week whether Brindisi would support Pelosi, and further accused the Democratic leader of “bankrolling” his campaign. Brindisi blunted that line of attack on Thursday, however, when he made clear that he would not support Pelosi as speaker if elected in November.  “I think it’s time for new Democratic leadership in Washington,” he told HuffPost, becoming only the latest Democratic candidate to say so.  The National Republican Congressional Committee, meanwhile, called Brindisi’s distancing of Pelosi politically expedient.  “Like a typical Albany machine politician, he’s proven once again that he will say anything to get elected,” NRCC spokesman Chris Martin said in a statement. Brindisi has toed the Democratic Party line on a number of issues, including health care, education, taxes and the economy. He has blasted Tenney for voting to repeal Obamacare as well as a number of financial regulations, and he has criticized the congresswoman for her support of the recent GOP tax law, which slashed taxes on big corporations. While he has not yet received support from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which highlighted him as one of its “Red to Blue” candidates, a super PAC aligned with the Democratic Party has begun running ads in support of his campaign. The latest 30-second television spot from House Majority PAC blasted Tenney for voting to repeal Obamacare. But Brindisi, a self-described “strong supporter of the Second Amendment,” is notably to the right of many Democrats on the issue of guns. Although he supports expanding background checks on gun purchases, he earned a 100 percent rating from the National Rifle Association, the nation’s top gun lobby, thanks to his vote against the New York SAFE Act, a 2013 gun control law written in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. He believes several of the law’s regulations ought to be repealed because they overly restrict the rights of upstate New York’s gun owners and because it was rushed through the Legislature in the wake of the massacre. “I firmly believe that a representative can support the Second Amendment and support common-sense reforms to try and cut down mass gun violence that occurs in our country,” he told HuffPost, emphasizing that he has not and does not intend to accept any donations from the NRA. Asked whether he supported banning assault weapons, Brindisi demurred, however, stating that he believed the “conversation has to be how do we keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous people.” Brindisi wouldn’t be the first pro-gun Democrat from rural Trump country to seek office and win. In March, Conor Lamb won the special congressional election in Pennsylvania’s 18th District on a platform that included not supporting additional gun control measures. He, too, said he’d like to see House Democrats replace Pelosi as their leader. It helped inoculate him from GOP attacks that tied him to Pelosi ― and it may help Brindisi equally well. For House Democrats, the path to regaining a majority depends on moderate candidates like Brindisi. Trump’s approval rating in upstate New York, especially, has declined, and party leaders are hoping they can woo Trump voters who haven’t benefited from GOP policies on health care, the budget and taxes. “For Democrats to be successful nationally, they have to win districts like some of the ones in New York,” Perry said. “If Republican incumbents don’t get re-elected in places like here, it’s not a good sign the party more broadly.”"

ARTS & CULTURE,"Just how do you take some old play—W. Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar, the Tony (Antonius) Award winner from 1599, for instance—and give it gut-wrenching relevance in Central Park circa today? Oskar Eustis goes for the jugular by surrounding his small-handed Caesar with thugs, handlers, and a trophy wife with an Eastern European accent. Obvious, perhaps, but instantly effective; what we get is a gripping tale of power-lust, murder and anarchy in the Capitol. Two-thirds of which might seem awfully familiar to those who read the morning papers (a.k.a. the “fake” morning papers).  The immediate result is that these olden characters from ancient Rome—Brutus, Cassius, Antony et al—seem to be of our time, speaking directly to us. None of this clambering about in togas; everybody is contemporary, with the members of the mob (commoners, as Shakespeare called them) indistinguishable from the members of the free admission Public audience. Eustis—the Public Theater artistic director, as well as stage director of this production—heightens the effect by building the production on contemporary performances from strong stage performers. Corey Stoll—of the Public’s recent Plenty, and widely familiar for his performance as disgraced congressman Peter Russo in the first season of “House of Cards”—makes a noble and conflicted Brutus. John Douglas Thompson, a Tony-nominee for January’s Jitney, commands the stage as Cassius, while Teagle F. Bougere adds power as Casca. Most arresting of the group is Elizabeth Marvel as Marc Antony (here played and referred to as a woman, which doesn’t quite make sense in context.) Even so, Marvel—who has five Public Theater credits, and is a cable celebrity thanks to her role as President-elect Elizabeth Keane in last season’s “Homeland”—brings rabble-rousing power to the role. The relatively unknown Gregg Henry makes a strong impression as the buffoonish president. That is, as Mr. Caesar, until he gets fileted in the Senate. (He is actually stripped naked at one point—in a rather humorous and fitting Emperor’s New Clothes tableaux—and one can only imagine he must get awfully cold up there some nights.) Tina Benko gets laughs as the model-spouse, Calpurnia, while Nikki M. James (of The Book of Mormon) offers support as Portia, wife to Brutus. Eustis peoples the vast Delacorte stage—designed by David Rockwell as if ancient Rome was located midway between DC and Occupy Wall Street—with a veritable mob. While the cast lists twenty-six players, an informal count suggests that there are enough extras around to swell the number close to fifty. The notion of a modern-themed Julius Caesar is not novel, exactly; Orson Welles set Broadway spinning with his Mussolini-flavored performance in the 1937 anti-fascist, Mercury Theatre production. The current Trumpian version is attention getting, certainly, and enhances the drama. The real-to-life links go astray, methinks, once the title character meets his fate on the Ides of March and cedes the spotlight for most of the rest of the evening.  But when Cassius asks, “How many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted over in states unborn and accents yet unknown?” we can only answer that we know one such age all too well.  Familiar Shakespearean quotes abound in Julius Caesar, and Mr. Eustis pointedly mentions—in his program notes—that “we didn’t write any new lines, it’s all Shakespeare.” Although there is indeed a joke (?) about Caesar getting away with it if he stabbed his mother on Fifth Avenue. Which doesn’t quite sound like the authentical Bard, but we do seem to have heard something of the sort elsewhere. Maybe it’s from Christopher Marlowe? The Public Theater production of William Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar opened May 23, 2017 and continues through June 18 at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park "
ARTS & CULTURE,"One of the most recent additions to the halls of New York’s Museum of Modern Art is a red San Francisco 49ers jersey. The same jersey worn by Colin Kaepernick between 2011 and 2016.  Kaepernick’s sports jersey hangs with four others featured in the ongoing MoMA exhibition “Items: Is Fashion Modern?”, which explores the impact of 111 carefully curated items of clothing and accessories on the 20th and 21st centuries.  The jersey is a unique item of clothing in that its uniform design conjures an almost immediate sense of power, promise and camaraderie. As MoMA curator Paola Antonelli and her curatorial team expressed in an email to HuffPost, “Children around the world look up to sports heroes as role models; for them, the jersey embodies a dream or aspiration.” Initially, jerseys were only worn by professional athletes, but in the 1970s, devoted fans began donning replicas of their favorite players’ uniforms. The trend eventually extended to the realm of streetwear, where jerseys became fashionable, independent of any specific athletic allegiance. Kaepernick’s jersey, the San Francisco 49ers’ number seven, became the best-selling jersey in the NFL’s official shop website in 2016 and remains one of the top selling items to this day. The stats are especially noteworthy seeing as Kaepernick no longer plays for the 49ers, or any other NFL team at present. The popularity of the uniform, then, illuminates the quarterback’s status not only as a star athlete but a contemporary icon of civil rights.  Kaepernick first sat down during the national anthem ahead a preseason game in August 2016, lowering himself in silent protest of the racial injustice plaguing the nation. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” he told NFL Media of his decision. “To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” In September 2016, Kaepernick took a knee instead of a seat, and has continued to do so ever since. The protest has been an unremitting source of inspiration, controversy and debate since its inception. Just last month, President Donald Trump criticized the gesture, while public figures including fellow NFL players, Stevie Wonder and former CIA director John Brennan expressed their unwavering support for Kaepernick and his demonstration.  After the 2016 season came to a close, Kaepernick opted out of his 49ers contract and has been a free agent ever since. Nonetheless, his red jersey continues to sell in massive quantities, a testament to the influence Kaepernick holds off the field as well as on it. His jersey embodies so much of the ongoing political conversation in this country today ― what America stands for, and what it kneels for.  “We hope that visitors to ’Items′ will see in these sports jerseys not only the blood, sweat and tears of their original wearers but also the complex synthesis of aesthetics, personal choice, collective style, politics, business, race, gender, marketing, labor and technology that are embodied by their reproductions,” Antonelli and her team wrote.  The other jerseys in the exhibition are Pelé’s 1958 FIFA World Cup Brazilian national soccer team jersey, Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls basketball jersey and the Black Ferns women’s rugby national team jersey. Athletic gear aside, the MoMA show will also feature garments including a little black dress, a keffiyeh, a pearl necklace and Levi’s 501 jeans.  “Items: Is Fashion Modern?” is on view until Jan. 28, 2018, at MoMA in New York.  Welcome to Battleground, where art and activism meet."
BUSINESS,"Bad bosses contaminate the workplace. Some do so obliviously, while others smugly manipulate their employees, using them as instruments of their own success. Regardless of their methods, bad bosses cause irrevocable damage to their companies and employees by hindering performance and creating unnecessary stress. The stress your boss causes is bad for your health. Multiple studies have found that working for a bad boss increases your chance of having a heart attack by as much as 50%. Even more troubling is the number of bad bosses out there. Gallup research found that 60% of government workers are miserable because of bad bosses. In another study 69% of US workers compared bosses with too much power to toddlers with too much power.  The comparisons don’t stop there. Significant percentages of US workers describe their bosses as follows: Most bosses aren’t surprised by these statistics. A DDI study found that 64% of managers admit that they need to work on their management skills. When asked where they should focus their efforts, managers overwhelmingly say, “Bringing in the numbers”; yet, they are most often fired for poor people skills. TalentSmart has conducted research with more than a million people, and we’ve found that 90% of top performers are skilled at managing their emotions in times of stress in order to remain calm and in control. One of their greatest gifts is the ability to neutralize toxic people—even those they report to. This is no easy task. It requires a great deal of emotional intelligence, a skill that top performers rely on. While the best option when you have a bad boss is to seek other employment, this isn’t always possible. Successful people know how to make the most of a bad situation. A bad boss doesn’t deter them because they understand that success is simply the product of how well you can play the hand you’ve been dealt. When that “hand” is a bad boss, successful people identify the type of bad boss they are working for and then use this information to neutralize their boss’ behavior. What follows are seven of the most common types of bad bosses and the strategies that successful people employ to work effectively with them. 1. The Inappropriate Buddy This is the boss who’s too friendly, and not in the fun, team-building sort of way. He is constantly inviting you to hang out outside of work and engages in unnecessary office gossip. He uses his influence to make friends at the expense of his work. He chooses favorites and creates divisions among employees, who become frustrated by the imbalance in attention and respect. He can’t make tough decisions involving employees or even fire those who need to be fired (unless he doesn’t like them). His office quickly becomes The Office. How to neutralize an inappropriate buddy: The most important thing to do with this type of boss is to learn to set firm boundaries. Don’t allow his position to intimidate you. By consciously and proactively establishing a boundary, you can take control of the situation. For example, you can remain friendly with your boss throughout the day but still not be afraid to say no to drinks after work. The difficult part here is maintaining consistency with your boundaries, even if your boss is persistent. By distancing yourself from his behaviors that you deem inappropriate, you will still be able to succeed and even have a healthy relationship with your boss. It’s important you don’t put up unnecessary boundaries that stop you from being seen as friendly (ideally, a friend). Instead of trying to change the crowd-pleaser and force him to be something he’s not, having him see you as an ally will put you in a stronger position than you could have anticipated. 2. The Micromanager This is the boss who makes you feel as if you are under constant surveillance. She thought your handwriting could use improvement, so she waited until you left work at 7:00 p.m. to throw away your pencils and replace them with the .9 lead mechanical pencils that have the “proper grip.” She has even handed back your 20-page report because you used a binder clip instead of a staple. The micromanager pays too much attention to small details, and her constant hovering makes employees feel discouraged, frustrated, and even uncomfortable. How to neutralize a micromanager: Successful people appeal to micromanagers by proving themselves to be flexible, competent, and disciplined while staying in constant communication. A micromanager is naturally drawn to the employee who produces work the way she envisions. The challenge with the micromanager is grasping the “envisioned way.” To do this, try asking specific questions about your project, check in frequently, and look for trends in the micromanager’s feedback. Of course, this will not always work. Some micromanagers will never stop searching for something to over-analyze and micromanage. When this is the case, you must learn to derive your sense of satisfaction from within. Don’t allow your boss’ obsession with details to create feelings of inadequacy as this will only lead to further stress and underperformance. Remember, a good report without a staple is still a good report. Despite your boss’ fixation on detail, she appreciates your work; she just doesn’t know how to show it. 3. The Tyrant The tyrant resorts to Machiavellian tactics and constantly makes decisions that feed his ego. His primary concern is maintaining power, and he will coerce and intimidate others to do so. The tyrant thinks of his employees as a criminal gang aboard his ship. He classifies people in his mind and treats them accordingly: High achievers who challenge his thinking are treated as mutinous. Those who support their achievements with gestures of loyalty find themselves in the position of first mate. Those who perform poorly are stuck cleaning the latrines and swabbing the decks. How to neutralize a tyrant: A painful but effective strategy with the tyrant is to present your ideas in a way that allows him to take partial credit. The tyrant can then maintain his ego without having to shut down your idea. Always be quick to give him some credit, even though he is unlikely to reciprocate, because this will inevitably put you on his good side. Also, to survive a tyrant, you must choose your battles wisely. If you practice self-awareness and manage your emotions, you can rationally choose which battles are worth fighting and which ones you should just let go. This way, you won’t find yourself on latrine duty. 4. The Incompetent This boss was promoted hastily or hired haphazardly and holds a position that is beyond her capabilities. Most likely, she is not completely incompetent, but she has people who report to her that have been at the company a lot longer and have information and skills that she lacks. How to neutralize an incompetent: If you find yourself frustrated with this type of boss, it is likely because you have experience that she lacks. It is important to swallow your pride and share your experience and knowledge, without rubbing it in her face. Share the information that this boss needs to grow into her role, and you’ll become her ally and confidant. 5. The Robot In the mind of the robot, you are employee number 72 with a production yield of 84 percent and experience level 91. This boss makes decisions based on the numbers, and when he’s forced to reach a conclusion without the proper data, he self-destructs. He makes little or no effort to connect with his employees, and instead, looks solely to the numbers to decide who is invaluable and who needs to go. How to neutralize a robot: To succeed with a robot, you need to speak his language. When you have an idea, make certain you have the data to back it up. The same goes with your performance—you need to know what he values and be able to show it to him if you want to prove your worth. Once you’ve accomplished this, you can begin trying to nudge him out of his antisocial comfort zone. The trick is to find ways to connect with him directly, without being pushy or rude. Schedule face-to-face meetings and respond to some of his e-mails by knocking on his door. Forcing him to connect with you as a person, however so slightly, will make you more than a list of numbers and put a face to your name. Just because he’s all about the numbers, it doesn’t mean you can’t make yourself the exception. Do so in small doses, however, because he’s unlikely to respond well to the overbearing social type. 6. The Visionary  Her strength lies in her ideas and innovations. However, this entrepreneurial approach becomes dangerous when a plan or solution needs to be implemented, and she can’t bring herself to focus on the task at hand. When the time comes to execute her vision, she’s already off onto the next idea, and you’re left to figure things out on your own. How to neutralize a visionary: To best deal with this type, reverse her train of thought. She naturally takes a broad perspective, so be quick to funnel things down into something smaller and more practical. To do so, ask a lot of specific questions that force her to rationally approach the issue and to consider potential obstacles to executing her broad ideas. Don’t refute her ideas directly, or she will feel criticized; instead, focus her attention on what it will take to realistically implement her plan. Oftentimes, your questions will diffuse her plan, and when they don’t, they’ll get her to understand—and commit to—the effort it’s going to take on her part to help make it happen. 7. The Seagull We’ve all been there—sitting in the shadow of a seagull manager who decided it was time to roll up his sleeves, swoop in, and squawk up a storm. Instead of taking the time to get the facts straight and work alongside the team to realize a viable solution, the seagull deposits steaming piles of formulaic advice and then abruptly takes off, leaving everyone else behind to clean up the mess. Seagulls interact with their employees only when there’s a fire to put out. Even then, they move in and out so hastily—and put so little thought into their approach—that they make bad situations worse by frustrating and alienating those who need them the most. How to neutralize a seagull: A group approach works best with seagulls. If you can get the entire team to sit down with him and explain that his abrupt approach to solving problems makes it extremely difficult for everyone to perform at their best, this message is likely to be heard. If the entire group bands together and provides constructive, non-threatening feedback, the seagull will more often than not find a better way to work with his team. It’s easy to spot a seagull when you’re on the receiving end of their airborne dumps, but the manager doing the squawking is often unaware of the negative impact of his behavior. Have the group give him a little nudge, and things are bound to change for the better.

ENTERTAINMENT,"Sorry, Brad Pitt, Ben Affleck and Chris Martin. Gwyneth Paltrow says she’s now in her first “adult relationship.” The actress and Goop guru told The Sunday Times that her fiance, writer-director Brad Falchuk, is taking her places that she’s never gone. “Now, for the first time, I feel I’m in an adult relationship that is sometimes uncomfortable, because he sort of demands a certain level of intimacy and communication that I haven’t been held to before,” she told couples counselor Esther Perel in an interview. “What came up in the first couple of years of our relationship was how incapable I was in this realm, how I feared intimacy and communication.” The Oscar winner, of course, was famously involved with Pitt and Affleck before her 10-years-plus marriage to Coldplay frontman Martin, which resulted in two children and a “conscious uncoupling.” She announced her engagement to Falchuk in January, more than three years after they met when Paltrow did a guest arc on “Glee.” Discussing no man in particular, Paltrow told the therapist: “In the past, I’ve been in relationships with men who had intimacy issues, so I could be, like, ‘I’m fine, I’m ready to do this,’ and let myself think he’s the one with the problem. In a way, some of the relationships were designed to keep me out of intimacy.” She continued: “I had two typical types of relationships: one where I was constantly chasing and trying to win someone over, and one where I was put off by the person’s capacity for the relationship ― and those relationships were very short-lived.” Check out the full interview at The Sunday Times.

POLITICS,"Just under one-third of Americans believe President Donald Trump has done even somewhat well at fulfilling his promise to “drain the swamp,” a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds. Only 8 percent of those polled believe that Trump has done very well at eliminating government corruption, while 24 percent say he’s done somewhat well, 13 percent say he’s not done very well, and 39 percent sat he hasn’t done well at all. One-quarter of respondents say that Trump is more honest than most other politicians in Washington, with 45 percent saying he’s less honest, and 16 percent that he’s close to average. Opinions are, unsurprisingly, divided along political lines, although Trump’s opponents are both more unanimous and more emphatic in their distaste for his job performance. About three-quarters of Trump voters say the president has done at least somewhat well in draining the swamp, but just 22 percent saying he’s done very well. By contrast, 81 percent of Hillary Clinton voters give Trump the lowest possible rating for his performance.   (The poll was taken before a sinkhole handed the Trump administration’s opponents an on-the-nose metaphor by opening up on the North Lawn of the White House.) Across the survey, the topline results are almost unchanged since spring 2017, when 30 percent thought Trump was doing well at draining the swamp. Since then, the polling suggests, he’s neither lost the faith of his core supporters nor done much to attract new support. These findings add to the body of evidence that views of the president’s personal characteristics may be largely ― though not entirely ― baked in, mirroring his remarkably stable approval numbers.  And, considerably more than a year into Trump’s tenure in the White House, the poll finds he’s still not viewed as a Washington insider by his supporters or opponents. Just 16 percent of those polled describe him as a part of the political establishment, while 61 percent say he’s more of an outsider. The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted May 16-18 among U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling. More details on the polls’ methodology are available here. Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov’s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error."
ARTS & CULTURE,"As Tracey Scott Wilson's Buzzer gets underway at the Public, Jackson (Grantham Coleman) introduces himself to the audience as a thriving young wrong-side-of-the-tracks lawyer whose credits include Exeter, Harvard and Harvard Law School.  Shortly after that, he's in the process of convincing girlfriend Suzy (Tessa Ferrer) that it's time for them to live together in an apartment he's bought in his now gentrified old neighborhood. That Suzy, who also introduces herself in a monologue, goes along with Jackson's reasoning is sufficiently believable.  Credulity is stretched to the breaking point and beyond it, however, when Don (Michael Stahl-David), a longtime friend of Jackson and a recovering substance abuser, makes himself known to the audience.  Don needs somewhere to stay, and Jackson prevails on Suzy to allow his pal squatter's rights while he keeps off the sauce and looks for a place.  He assures her that Don, who's been in and out of rehab eight times, has finally cleaned up his act.  (It turns out that Don has only been in and out of rehab seven times.  He lied to them about one of the times he claimed he went.) Reluctantly, Suzy acquiesces.  Yes, theater skeptics, it's hard to believe anyone would agree, but Suzy does, because if she doesn't, there's no play.  Even so, there's not much of a play.  Put another way, what play there is is annoyingly predictable.  Wilson makes it obvious from Don's entrance that sooner or later--but not much later that 90 minutes later--his presence will cause strife and very likely irreparable harm. The only suspense as the three of them wrangle with each other and Suzy wrangles with a couple of street toughs who harass her outside the home--where she never feels fully at home--are the details by which complications accrue.  None of those details will be detailed here, except to say one of the most flagrant developments is likely the one that every sentient patron will know is bound to arrive from the moment Don darkens the doorstep. Anne Kaufman directs solidly, and Coleman, Ferrer and Stahl-David hold up their end of the compromised bargain with sturdy performances that flesh out real characters but never alleviate the basic problem: Patrons are far ahead of them within minutes of the start and remain there for the rest of the work. What's really arresting about Buzzer--sound designer Bray Poor supplies many front door buzzes--is Laura Jellinek's set.  Two thirds of the stage is sparsely furnished.  Prominent are a sleek divan, a couple of end tables and a lamp.  It's at stage right where Jellinek constructs her inspiration.  A series of rooms cut off about four feet from the floor stand in shocking white ranks to represent the rest of the gentrified space.  Now that's a remarkable metaphor for a residence that's remains stubbornly incomplete.  Kudos to Jellinek, it not to Wilson. ***************************** Reviewers are not expected to be kind but to be fair.  Every once in a while, though, a reviewer feels the need to be kind.  Clinton The Musical (note no colon) has generated that feeling in me.  So just let me be kind and say that the tuner at New World Stages with book by Michael Hodge and Paul Hodge and songs by the latter is perfectly awful. The topic is Bill Clinton's Presidency with, as might be expected, an emphasis on the Monica Lewinsky affair.  A curious reader might want to know why anyone would think it timely to satirize an administration that ended 15 years ago and was well covered when it was topical.  Possibly the Hodges think they've contributed something to a depiction of the President as two characters--WJ Clinton (Tom Galantich) and Billy Clinton (Duke Lafoon)--who stand, respectively, for the good William Jefferson Clinton and the philandering William Jefferson Clinton.  The creators may have fooled themselves into thinking they've updated the subject matter by making Hilary Rodham Clinton (Kerry Butler, the astounding belter) the focal figure. Whatever they were thinking when they jerry-rigged this entertainment(?), they were a long distance from anything genuine.  Running down a long list of their misguided notions--among them, a squealing Newt Gingrich (John Treacy Egan), a fey Kenneth Starr (Kevin Zak), a lumbering Eleanor Roosevelt (Judy Gold)--is a waste of your time and mine. The only other comment I'll make about the 95-minute time-waster is that it includes perhaps an all-time show-tune low point.  Listed is the program as ""Monica's Song"" and delivered by Veronica J. Kuehn, the lyric contains many times over the declaration ""I'm f***ing the f***ing President.""  I include asterisks not because I'm being prudish but because I don't want to honor anything quite so base by naming it exactly. For the record: Dan Knechtges directed and choreographed by keeping things moving rapidly.  (Was he hoping that pacing would mask the total absence of acceptable script?)  David Woolard designed the costumes, Paul Miller the lighting and Peter Fitzgerald the sound.  The always remarkable Beowulf Boritt designed the set, and once again (see above review) provided the one aspect truly worth full, or any, attention."
ARTS & CULTURE," The Museum. Close to celebrating its 40th anniversary (in February 2017) the Centre Pompidou Museum in Paris is continuing to offer important and vibrant retrospectives of famous painters and crafters, as well as still launching many careers of less-known artists. The colorful industrial-looking museum, controversial at first when it opened in the heart of Paris and made some people cry in visual pain, while others clapped in delirious support, as the building was deemed ""unfinished"", ""shocking"", ""vulgar"", the ugly scar in the middle of beautiful classic architectural surroundings. It stood the test of time, and 40 years later, the seven-story structure of metal and pipes stills draws controversy and very opinioned rants about its location, architectural style, and place in a city of beauty.  Designed and built by architects Renzo Piano, Richard Rogers, and Gianfranco Franchini, the massive arts complex was renovated in 2000, and won the Pritzker Prize in 2007, as its jury noted that the Pompidou ""revolutionized museums, transforming what had once been elite monuments into popular places of social and cultural exchange, woven into the heart of the city.""
 The Artist. Who does not know René Magritte? The Belgian philosopher/surrealist/manipulative artist who gave us a laugh with a chicken looking at a soft-boiled egg, or a hat without a head resting on a stiff shirt collar.  Or perhaps it was a green apple face under a bowler hat, or maybe the multiple umbrella men floating in the sky above a city.  Whatever it is you remember most about his art, it is surely a dream-like image, a fiction, a distortion of the senses, a naïve and elaborate visual made of everyday things and objects. Magritte was good at that, a prince of silly matters, a master of deception and a player of subtlety. The often enchanting world of Magritte offers adults and children alike a new way to look at art - a non-serious view of what a fantasy universe would be like. Magritte and Dali were both painters of perfection in a very silly kind of style, and their polished work seduced and endure in the hearts of their viewers as cherished pieces of wonderful memories. ""Magritte engaged in a sort of theoretical battle with philosophers,"" said Didier Ottinger, the curator of the exhibition at Beaubourg, ""to prove that pictures can portray thoughts on the same level as words could."" Magritte (1898-1967) lived all his life, and died, in Belgium, except for three years spent in France among other painters.  He was tied to the Communist Party, but was very critical of the cultural policy of the left, stating that: ""Class consciousness is as necessary as bread, but that does not mean that workers must be condemned to bread and water and that wanting chicken and champagne would be harmful. "" INFO: Magritte. ""La trahison des images"" (""The Treachery Of Images"")

ENTERTAINMENT,"Becca “Do the Damn Thing” Kufrin’s season of “The Bachelorette” is a mere 10 days away from premiering, and thus we finally get to meet the ex-football players, models and banjoists who will be wooing her. We use “meet” loosely, because for some ungodly reason, ABC has decided to do away with the questionnaire-style bios “The Bachelorette” bros usually are forced to fill out and instead gave fans bland, pun-laden paragraphs about the contestants. You would not believe how many of these bros love fitness and spending time with their families! “Here to Make Friends” podcast hosts Claire Fallon and Emma Gray got deep into their feelings on this one. Emma Gray: Let’s do the damn thing! Claire Fallon: Ugh, Emma. Not off to a good start. EG: You know what else isn’t off to a good start? The way they redid the cast bios this year. CF: It feels personal. It feels directed at us. EG: “You had so much fun making fun of all the dumb answers these guys put on their insane questionnaires, we’re going to take that away from you.” CF: It’s not enough that they have Chris Harrison announce the contestants and make little cracks about their bios ― which is what we do, Chris. Stay in your lane. EG: Chris needs a new job now that he’s down to only, like, one minute of airtime per episode. CF: Doesn’t he also do Miss America and … something else? EG: He does. OK, fine, he has other things to do besides “The Bachelor.” CF: He just flies from set to set around the world and pops in for, like, 30 seconds, waves at the camera and leaves. It’s hard to keep up with that kind of lifestyle. EG: I don’t know, it sounds like a good life. CF: He seems happy. Good for him. EG: Do we have any initial trends that have jumped out at us from this crop of poorly posed gentlemen? CF: Yes. First of all, instead of little fun facts, they’re all just bios. Once you do that, they all start to seem more similar. Because it really highlights that, yeah, this is a guy, he’s from a place and he likes to do his job in an office and then go to the beach on the weekends. And that’s, like, all of them. EG: They all love life. CF: Yeah. And they’re all “self-proclaimed” something. Someone wrote these for them, because some are very similar. It’s like, “He’s a self-proclaimed weekend warrior.” What does that mean? EG: I think what happened is that they still had them fill out that questionnaire, and it was things like, “Are you a weekend warrior or a weekday —” CF: Warrior. EG: “— warrior?” I don’t know. And then they tasked some intern with turning a few pieces of each questionnaire into coherent sentences, which is just a waste of everyone’s time. CF: Yeah, this is not better. Some other trends we noticed ― and this is, again, maybe something that would be true in the past, but it’s highlighted by this format ― is that a lot of them work in finance, and several of them are pro athletes.  EG: It feels like almost more pro athletes than usual. CF: I do think there are more pro athletes than usual, but also sometimes [in the past] the profession might be obscured because they would get a fun profession, like “chicken enthusiast,” and then it doesn’t tell you what they actually do in the bio. EG: Or … “former competitive swimmer,” like with [Season 12’s] Robby, because he swam in college. CF: And then has done nothing else since then. Whereas here we get “social media participant,” and it’s like, that’s a wacky job title. But then in the bio you find out he’s a model or whatever, and the jig’s up. There’s no mystery. So we know exactly how many of them are models. Several — I didn’t actually count them. EG: There seems to be an OK amount of racial diversity. [Note: Based on headshots and bios, at least nine men of color appear to be among the 28 suitors.] CF: And several people who immigrated either at very young ages or later in childhood to the U.S. EG: Or are first generation. I found that interesting that they chose to really highlight that, because that’s often not something that we see focused on. I’m sure there have been men and women on the show who are children of immigrants or are immigrants themselves, but we rarely see that played up, especially when there are only three sentences to sell you on something. CF: I’m thinking of Jubilee and Kristina, and I can’t really, off the top of my head, think of — EG: And those are both really traumatic stories of immigration. CF: I am wondering — I feel like they’re tipping their hand to some things that in the past might have been hidden until they were on a one-on-one date, and then they’d be like, “Well, actually, my family is from Haiti, and here’s how that went down.” We didn’t find out that much about people’s deep backstories in the old bios. If you can’t tell, we are not fans of the new bios. EG: I don’t even know what to talk about. They’re all blending together into a Ken doll of different shades.  CF: We also have to talk about the ― EG: The hair? CF: I mean, everything about the headshots. I know we always say they’re too Photoshopped, but seriously, some of them look CGI.  But we’re going to get into that. We’re going to go — EG: Man by man. CF: — one by one, and we’re going to see what we can find out about these guys.   For a deep dive on the cast bios, check out the full episode of “Here to Make Friends”: Subscribe to “Here to Make Friends”: Apple Podcasts / Acast / RadioPublic / Google Play / Stitcher / RSS Do people love “The Bachelor,” “The Bachelorette” and “Bachelor in Paradise,” or do they love to hate these shows?

BUSINESS,"Why do people leave organizations? Reasons often include dealing with bad management, finding a higher paid role elsewhere, or not seeing opportunities for promotion and growth. Workplace sexual harassment is rarely treated as an issue of retention, but it affects morale and career satisfaction at least as drastically as an issue like a difficult boss.  Sexual harassment is one of the many ways workplaces are a hostile environment for women, pushing them out of organizations and sometimes entire industries. And sexual harassment clearly reflects the power structures that define our society. It exacts a high cost on all individuals and communities, but the price is disproportionately shouldered by women who can least afford it. Women of color and other marginalized women are among those hit hardest by a culture that for generations has turned a blind eye to the epidemic.   Workplace sexual harassment comes with a steep cost: the cost of participation. A 2008 study by the American Psychological Association found a correlation between “work withdrawal” and the aftermath of sexual harassment for black women. And in a 2016 survey of the Chicago leisure and hospitality industry, where the majority of women are of color, 49 percent of housekeepers said a guest had answered the door naked or exposed themselves. The most damning result? Of those housekeepers, 56 percent said they did not feel safe returning to work after the incident.  The system was failing these women. Formal report numbers were low, partly because the workers didn’t believe it would make a difference to tell their stories. In fact, 43 percent of respondents said they knew someone who had reported harassment and seen nothing change. Unfortunately, their fears are well-founded. Two-third of employees who spoke out against workplace mistreatment faced some sort of retaliation, according to a 2003 study cited by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. And although times are changing, they might not be changing for women in certain workplaces just yet.   The outpouring of recent allegations of sexual harassment and subsequent consequences for some perpetrators have prompted many to say we’re in the middle of a turning point in how sexual harassment is dealt with. This is true for some women, but not for all. When allegations against Harvey Weinstein and other powerful men turned Hollywood upside down, Jane Fonda pointed out the obvious: The women speaking out were being listened to because they were famous and white. Fatima Goss Graves, the CEO of the National Women’s Law Center, agreed, saying, “Class and race and stature play into whether someone is believed.” Ironically, the #MeToo movement was started a decade ago by black social activist Tarana Burke. It took Alyssa Milano, a white actress, using the hashtag for it to go viral ― among other white women, at least. We’ve seen this before, such as in the racism of the suffragettes, FEMEN’s attempts to “liberate” Muslim women despite protests, and the exclusive nature of the Women’s March. When marginalized women, particularly women of color, need solidarity, their white sisters don’t often show up. We have seen this play out in the cases of black actresses like Lupita Nyong’o and Aurora Perrineau. The implication is clear: Yes, women who allege sexual harassment and other forms of abuse are to be believed ― if they’re the right kind of woman. The majority of women don’t fit that criteria, and those who live and work at the intersections of marginalization ― whether due to race, religion or disability ― are often hardest hit by harassment. Unfortunately, they’re also the least supported. The eventual outcome is dismal.   For women who are not famous, wealthy or otherwise influential, socioeconomic, cultural and historical disadvantages compound to make it more likely that harassment will occur and less likely that it will be taken seriously.  The history of sexual exploitation through slavery has created a culture where black women are more likely to be sexually harassed but less likely to be perceived as victims. They are therefore less likely to report, and the cycle continues. Socioeconomic status exacerbates this vulnerability; the majority (58 percent, as of 2013) of low-income families in the U.S. are a racial or ethnic minority. Low-income women of color often lack bargaining power, face language and financial barriers to accessing legal services, and in some cases, are not even aware of their rights. Undocumented workers also face unique additional challenges, as fears of retaliation or deportation may deter them from taking legal action. It is imperative to acknowledge that efforts to improve the lot of one group of women may only tangentially affect women in other groups.  If we are truly interested in building a world where all women feel safe, supported and able to fully participate in their communities and workplaces, we must remember a rising tide does not lift every woman’s boat. We need to be proactive in our advocacy for low-wage women and women of color. We must ensure vulnerable women are provided adequate training, in the language they are most comfortable in, so they understand their rights. The more educated a workplace is, the less likely potential perpetrators will be to think they can get away with harassment. We need to find ways to support these women ― legally, financially, emotionally ― when action is taken.   The #MeToo moment will be incomplete if it serves only the white, wealthy and otherwise privileged among us. Look around in your own workplace and make sure no woman is being overlooked. Failing to do so will not only affect the women as individuals, but will ultimately damage our workplaces, our communities and our societies. We will all be poorer for it."
POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― House Republicans say they’re making progress on a plan to do the long-impossible: unite a fractured GOP conference on the issue of immigration. With GOP moderates still pushing for a slate of votes on immigration, House Republicans generally are feeling the pressure to come up with a plan to finally address the precarious state of the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals program. A small group of GOP moderates, conservatives and leaders emerged from a meeting Wednesday afternoon saying they were getting closer to an immigration bill that might be able to pass the House with almost exclusively Republican support. Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.), one of those leading the effort to force a series of immigration votes through a discharge petition, told reporters he was hopeful that Republicans could come up with the outlines of an immigration deal to address DACA as soon as Thursday. “We’re getting pretty close,” he said. Other Republicans also sounded optimistic about the prospects of a deal. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said members have been having some “really good talks.” Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said there was “more than a reasonable chance” that Republicans would strike a deal by Thursday. And Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), another moderate immigration advocate, said the roughly hour-and-a-half meeting in the Capitol was “not a waste of time.” But as bullish as Republicans were on Wednesday, there were still some key sticking points that could ultimately prevent an immigration agreement. For one, moderates and conservatives don’t have a shared concept of a “permanent solution” for undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Denham noted Wednesday that his preferred idea is to allow them to file for legal status for five-year periods, with the ultimate goal being legal permanent residence in 10 years, and Curbelo said a permanent solution for these types of childhood arrivals was “essential” to any deal. Meadows, however, said it was important that any deal has “no special pathway to citizenship,” although he did say he was open to allowing undocumented immigrants to “work toward citizenship.” These differences over the endpoint, which may seem like minor distinctions, are actually major policy disagreements that lawmakers have yet to sort out. And there are some Republicans who just don’t see a way to split the difference. Immigration hardliner Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) told HuffPost on Wednesday that he saw himself as “diametrically opposed” to Denham on immigration and that he felt there were many members who would vote the interests of their individual districts rather than just accepting a deal. Moderates believe that one solution could be to offer multiple votes on multiple bills during an immigration vote-a-rama. But conservatives see that proposal as hardly any different from what moderates want anyway, and Meadows was emphatic Wednesday that, if there were a deal, it had to consist of one bill. Another problem standing in the way of GOP consensus is that moderates and conservatives both believe they have the upper hand. Moderates note that they are getting dangerously close to having enough Republicans and Democrats signed on to a discharge petition to force a vote on a slate of different immigration proposals. That means they could pass a bill through the House with the help of roughly a few dozen Republicans and every Democrat. Meanwhile, conservatives believe any immigration deal that Republicans strike among themselves would skew more toward the conservatives’ ideology, considering the small number of moderates in the 235-person Republican House majority. They also note that any immigration deal would have to win Senate approval and secure President Donald Trump’s signature to become law. On that point, lawmakers are left to mostly guess where Trump would do. The Senate tried and failed to pass immigration legislation of its own earlier this year, sunk in part by hardline demands from the White House. Trump rejected bipartisan proposals to increase border security measures and grant legal status to Dreamers, and his administration lobbied senators to oppose those proposals in favor of a bill that included measures to restrict legal immigration and end protections for immigrants at the border. The Trump-backed bill ultimately received only 39 votes ― less than the bipartisan alternatives that received a vote. But the president has shown no indication that he’s willing to budge from his demands for a sweeping immigration bill. In the months since, he has only doubled down on calls to toughen policy against asylum-seekers and children at the border ― two items Democrats adamantly oppose. Still, Trump’s past vow to support any immigration bill that Congress sends him rings in the ears of moderates, and many of them believe the president is personally more open than his staff to a solution with a pathway to citizenship, particularly if it also includes money for a border wall. Lawmakers have been grasping for an immigration bill since last year, when Trump rescinded the DACA policy that allowed nearly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, often called Dreamers, to stay and work. DACA recipients are currently able to renew their protections because of court injunctions, which helped quiet some of the calls for action from Congress. But GOP moderates from districts with large immigrant populations see a pressing need to resolve the issue. While those moderates believe they have the votes (with Democrats) to get a bill through the House utilizing a discharge petition, they are also open to a negotiation with their fellow conservative Republicans and GOP leaders in the hopes that it could result in a bill becoming a law. “We want an opportunity to pass a bill that can be signed by the president,” Curbelo said Wednesday. And even though it seems like moderates and conservatives are on mainly opposite sides of the issue, both factions at least want to exhaust all options within the Republican conference before they truly square off ― either to strengthen their case that there is no solution or to actually, somewhat miraculously, come to an agreement. As Meadows tried to explain the reasons for his optimism that an immigration deal could come together shortly, he said that even though Republicans have been arguing over this issue for decades, he thought that now they could finally write something that would win over almost everyone in the conference. “I’m used to accomplishing the impossible,” he said."
